A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases."", 'Alexandria Real Estate Equities in Focus', ""Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.57%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%, meaning it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $9.44 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.24%.', 'Bottom Line', ""From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout."", 'High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity.

So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$36.08. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 62 cents per share on revenues of $1.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil and gas producer’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MRO’s previous-quarter results first.', 'In the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based upstream player beat the consensus mark on strong domestic oil and gas production, to go with lower unit costs. MRO had reported adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. Revenues of $1.8 billion generated by the firm also came in 3.4% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Marathon Oil beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'Marathon Oil Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote', '\xa0', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 29.6% deterioration year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 4.3% decrease from the year-ago period.', 'Lower oil and natural gas realizations are likely to have hurt Marathon Oil’s revenues and cash flows. Going by our model, MRO’s fourth-quarter key U.S. E&P segment’s realized average liquids price (crude oil and condensate) is pegged at $77.80 per barrel — down from the year-earlier level of $84.29. Additionally, our projection for the average realized natural gas prices reflects a 42.4% year-over-year drop.On a further bearish note, the increase in Marathon Oil’s costs might have dented its to-be-reported bottom line. In particular, our estimate for production cost is pegged at $201.2 million, indicating an 11.2% increase from $181 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our model also predicts the company’s total expenses to go up 9.6% year over year to $1.1 billion. The upward cost trajectory could be attributed to the ongoing inflationary environment and a tight labor market.But giving some respite to the company, Marathon Oil is expected to have benefited from higher output during the quarter. Considering MRO’s impressive production profile from its high-margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford, Bakken, Oklahoma and Permian), our expectation for the company’s fourth-quarter volume is pegged at some 396,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), up 19.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level of 333,000 BOE/d.', 'The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter.

It was one of the greatest gains in the history of financial markets, and it would have been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of $3 into more than $1 million.', 'But the token has since plummeted 89% from its all-time high. A couple of things have contributed to the weakness: Shiba Inu has failed to gain traction as a payment mechanism, and investor sentiment toward speculative cryptocurrencies deteriorated starting in 2022.', 'However, the tide appears to be turning for the better in the crypto industry. Bitcoin is up 23% in 2024 already, and the total value of all crypto in existence has reached $2 trillion for the first time in almost two years.', ""So can Shiba Inu ride the bullish wave to deliver more gains? Theoretically, it could soar from its current price of $0.0000098 all the way to $1 -- but it might not lead to life-changing fortunes for investors. Here's why."", 'Cryptocurrency fever peaked in 2021 when the total value of all tokens hit nearly $3 trillion. But it all fell apart in 2022 when some of the most prominent crypto experiments imploded.', ""The TerraUSD stablecoin de-pegged, wiping out an estimated $60 billion in value for investors in the process. Then one of the world's leading crypto exchanges, FTX, collapsed in a mess of fraud and deception that led to the conviction of its founder. By the end of 2022, the crypto industry was worth a mere $830 billion."", ""A modest recovery started in 2023, but soaring interest rates capped investors' appetite for risk. Nevertheless, leading coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum carried some positive momentum into 2024, and they are slowly trending toward their all-time highs."", ""The speculative end of the market -- where Shiba Inu lives -- remains subdued. Meme-tokens delivered losses so steep over the past couple of years that investors are still hesitant to buy. Unfortunately, Shiba Inu isn't giving them much reason for optimism; it hasn't generated any traction as a payment mechanism, and a mere 917 merchants around the world accept it in exchange for goods and services."", ""If speculative investors aren't convinced Shiba Inu will move higher, and consumers aren't adopting it, it will be hard to create or sustain any value over the long term."", ""Investors might finally be wising up to the main problem plaguing Shiba Inu: There are 589.3 trillion tokens in circulation, which is why it trades at a somewhat unconventional price point of $0.0000098. Even though it's lightyears away from trading at one cent ($0.01), let alone $1, the total value of all 589.3 trillion tokens at the current price is $5.8 billion."", 'Simple math dictates that if Shiba Inu did rise to $1, it would give the ecosystem a market capitalization of a whopping $589.3 trillion. For context:', ""Microsoft is the largest company in the world, and it's valued at just $3 trillion."", 'U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 was $27.9 trillion.', 'Global wealth -- all of the cash and assets held by households, corporations, and governments all over the world -- stood at $454 trillion in 2022.', 'So at $1 per token, Shiba Inu would be worth more than the total value of all of the recorded wealth on Earth. In other words, $1 is a pipe dream for investors in the current circumstances.', 'However, the Shiba Inu community is currently ""burning"" tokens, which means removing them from the supply forever. The easiest way to participate is to send tokens to a dead wallet where they can never be retrieved. But enthusiasts have also created platforms like the Shiba Search internet search engine, which uses advertising revenue to buy Shiba Inu tokens to burn them. Similarly, there is also a music playlist people can stream that uses the royalties for the same purpose.', 'Theoretically, burning enough tokens will push Shiba Inu to $1 organically -- as supply shrinks, the price per token has to rise in order to maintain a constant market capitalization.', ""Based on Shiba Inu's current market cap of $5.8 billion, supply would have to fall to 5.8 billion tokens to organically lift the price per token to $1. In other words, roughly 99.99998% of the 589.3 trillion tokens now in supply would have to be burned."", 'About 353 million Shiba Inu tokens have been burned during the past month. That translates to 4.2 billion tokens over the course of one year. At that pace, it would take 140,300 years to burn enough tokens to warrant a price of $1 -- so 2024 is probably off the table.', ""Here's the kicker. It wouldn't even result in a profit for investors. In order to burn that many tokens, practically every person holding Shiba Inu tokens would have to participate. By the end, they would be holding 99.99998% fewer tokens, and even though the tokens that remain are worth $1 each, the total value of their position won't have changed."", ""Overcoming Shiba Inu's supply problem is a gargantuan task, and it won't mean much in the end. The only way to drive the token's actual value higher is to give investors and consumers a genuine reason to own it, and that doesn't appear to be happening."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Shiba Inu right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shiba Inu wasn’t one of them.

Wall Street estimates have steadily floated higher for Nvidia in recent months.', 'For the fourth quarter, analysts expect revenue to skyrocket 237% to $20.4 billion, and see earnings per share jumping from $0.88 to $4.56.', ""Those are lofty expectations, but they aren't unwarranted. In its third quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared by 206% to $18.1 billion, and it forecast revenue of around $20 billion in the fourth quarter."", ""There's also evidence that the AI boom is still picking up speed based on reports from some of Nvidia's partners."", ""Arm (NASDAQ: ARM) shares soared after it showed off accelerating revenue growth in its recent earnings report and touted a surge in AI-related demand. Arm licenses its CPU technology to Nvidia, and Arm designs are featured in Nvidia products like the Grace Hopper H200 Superchip, which is a more advanced version of the hugely popular H100 GPU that's been at the center of the AI boom."", 'Additionally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) shares have gone parabolic since the company reported preliminary results in January that were well ahead of expectations as its revenue doubled in the quarter. The company makes high-density servers and storage solutions that have been in high demand for their AI capabilities, and they run on Nvidia GPUs. Supermicro stock has surged 182% year to date and is up nearly 900% since the start of 2023.', ""Both of those earnings reports would bode well for Nvidia's update because Arm, Supermicro, and Nvidia are all benefiting from the same trends."", ""If you're buying a stock, it's best to plan to hold it for at least a year, which offers tax benefits and the advantage of smoothing out the volatility inherent in the stock market."", 'As Benjamin Graham said, ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it\'s a weighing machine."" It\'s easier to be right on a stock\'s ""weight"" than its popularity, which helps give an advantage to long-term investors.', ""It's impossible to know for certain whether Nvidia will go up or down on its earnings report. But if you're buying the stock, you should be buying it because you believe it has sustainable competitive advantages that will enable it to continue to dominate the market for GPUs and AI chips, and use that as leverage to enter new markets such as PCs, which it recently announced plans to do."", ""There's no shortage of euphoria for Nvidia or other stocks with AI exposure, and several small-cap stocks recently skyrocketed when Nvidia revealed that it had taken small stakes in those companies."", ""However, the recent surges from Arm and Supermicro indicate the market still seems to be underestimating the potential for AI hardware stocks like Nvidia. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the stock is more likely to go up than down on the earnings report, and the options market is betting on that as well."", ""Beyond earnings, Nvidia's competitive advantages seem to be strengthening, and demand for AI applications is likely to expand for the next several years, which will drive demand for its chips."", 'Even after its monster rally, the stock looks like a smart long-term buy heading into earnings.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The fourth-quarter 2023 earnings update justified this company's dominant position in the market as the realization settles in that artificial intelligence (AI) -- or maybe just accelerated computing -- is more than just a passing fad."", 'But as Arista is ultimately a hardware-based business, periods of rapid growth can quickly come to an end. In fact, growth is expected to slow a bit for Arista in 2024. Is this still a top stock to bet on the future of data center and AI computing?', '2023 was an epic rebound for Arista. After several years of building to its AI supercomputing crescendo, the company put up incredible growth numbers -- with ""Cloud Titan"" customers Meta (NASDAQ: META) (21% of total revenue last year) and Microsoft (18% of revenue) leading the charge. A flurry of big tech businesses have been building out new data center infrastructure in support of accelerated computing, and Arista is a key partner in helping them put all the pieces together.', 'Financial Metric', '2023 Results', 'YOY % Change', 'Revenue', '$5.86 billion', '34%', 'GAAP earnings per share (EPS)', '$6.58', '54%', 'Adjusted EPS', '$6.94', '52%', 'Data source: Arista Networks.', 'In the chart above, you can see Arista\'s revenue and profitability really ratchet up in the wake of the pandemic. That\'s thanks in large part to the ""Cloud Titan"" customers (especially Microsoft and Meta) building and upgrading their data centers in support of all the new internet traffic they picked up the last few years. For Microsoft, that has been primarily its Azure cloud platform for businesses, and for Meta, its consumer-facing apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp needing to operate more traffic and launch new AI-powered advertising services for marketers. Arista\'s engineering teams have been busy helping both companies expand their data center capabilities.', 'But things could finally be starting to cool down in 2024, mostly due to the big data center customers moderating their spend on infrastructure (all together, including Meta and Microsoft, ""Cloud Titans"" accounted for 43% of total sales last year). Management said other enterprise customers should still grow, but the end result is a forecast for just 10% to 12% revenue growth in the year ahead. RW: Do these tables really add anything to the piece? We already mention the 10% to 12% forecast in the text and stacking these on top of each other might be more distracting than helpful. We could simply add this information into the text and alleviate some of the information bloat and we could make it more meaningful and clearer to less experienced readers in the process.', ""Growth is growth, so it's no big deal. After all, Arista is holding onto all of its big gains from the last few years. But the problem with a slowdown is that Arista stock now trades for a whopping 40 times trailing-12-month EPS and 42 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. That's about the highest valuation it has traded for in years, excluding during the pandemic when stocks went wild for a while. Is this really a good stock to buy right now, and is data center AI an enduring growth trend or not?"", ""For years, Arista has been gobbling up market share, especially at the expense of giant networking hardware leader Cisco. Cisco isn't exactly taking its eye off the ball, but it has been focused on software as of late. Remember its pending mega-acquisition of Splunk?"", ""Because of this, and Arista's leading platform for network hardware and built-in software suite, I don't see any reason why the trend favoring Arista will change anytime soon, especially as new AI infrastructure (which Arista helps engineer, too) is further complicating data center needs going forward."", 'And while Arista is taking a cautious view to 2024, it is still confident in its ability to grow at a low-teens percentage clip over the long term. Along the way, it churns out high rates of profitability. At this point, the company has just over $5 billion in cash and investments on balance and no debt, which could fuel its ambitions.', ""Viewed in this light, Arista is a premium-priced stock, but reasonably so if you factor in excellent growth prospects over the next five years and beyond. I'm happy to hold my position, as Arista is a key partner for all sorts of data centers, and won't be dislodged easily as the AI era continues apace."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arista Networks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arista Networks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arista Networks wasn’t one of them.

This outsourcing approach empowers businesses to concentrate on their core competencies while external experts manage these critical functions."", '5 Trends Shaping the Future of Outsourcing Industry', 'Rising Demand Environment: The industry has gained traction over the past year, thanks to the recent advancements in the field of technology and the onset of remote work. Revenues, income and cash flows have been growing in the past year, aiding many industry players to pay out stable dividends.', 'Continued Growth of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO): Most outsourcing activities occur at lower levels within the organizational hierarchy. Per Grand View Research, the global market for BPO reached a valuation of $261.9 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% from 2023 to 2030. The demand for these services remains high due to their advantages, including greater flexibility, cost reduction and improved service quality.', 'Relevance of IT Outsourcing: The IT Outsourcing market is projected to generate revenues of approximately $460.10 billion in 2023, with an anticipated CAGR of 11.07% from 2023 to 2028. The upside is expected to lead to a market size of about $777.70 billion by 2028. In the future, outsourced IT services will cover a wide range of functions, including programming and technical support. Organizations can outsource entire IT departments to cut costs and focus on core tasks. A significant driver of outsourcing trends will be the shortage of in-house engineering talent.', 'Rising Importance of Cybersecurity: Heightened public awareness and evolving cyber threats, like ransomware and national-level cyberattacks, have led to a growing demand for robust data encryption and cybersecurity measures. Companies prioritize employee security awareness training and breach detection systems to prevent cybersecurity incidents. To address these challenges, businesses increasingly turn to outsourced cybersecurity services to mitigate risks, maintain compliance and support scalability in their operations.', 'Emerging Technology Trends: Trends like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are on the verge of reshaping the outsourcing sector. These innovations propel efficiency, foster innovation and bolster competitiveness, altering the delivery of outsourcing services and opening novel avenues for businesses to enhance their operational efficiency. For instance, IoT data can be collected, processed and analyzed in the cloud, enabling real-time decision-making and predictive maintenance for clients.

You can skip our detailed analysis on some of the most harmful chemicals used in this tube-shaped tobacco product, and head over directly to the 5 Cigarette Brands With The Least Chemicals In The World.', 'According to the American Lung Association, cigarettes contain about 600 ingredients which, when they burn, create over 7,000 chemicals. Of these, at least 69 are known to be linked to cancer. Some of the most toxic chemicals present in cigarettes include acetone, found in nail polish removers; arsenic, used for rat poison; toluene, a chemical used in paint manufacturing; tar, which is also used to pave roads; and nicotine which is commonly used as an insecticide.', 'A 2021 publication by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a non-profit organization, stated that about 80% of the world’s smokers lived in low and middle income countries, and that if current trends were to continue, about a billion people could die from smoking related diseases in the 21st century. In 2020, more than 5.2 trillion cigarettes were sold to over a billion consumers, with a global retail volume estimated to be worth $717 billion.', 'China is the largest market for cigarettes in the world, with a retail value of $232.8 billion in 2020. Indonesia, Turkiye, Japan, Egypt, Vietnam, and Bangladesh were other countries with higher retail volumes of cigarettes that year. Cigarette sales grew 7.5% in the Asia-Pacific, and increased 15.3% in the Middle East and North Africa region between 2006 and 2020. These trends go on to show that emerging markets in Asia and Africa are critical for the tobacco industry, while cigarette consumption is beginning to decline in the developed world due to stronger government regulation.', 'The United States is also among the top smoking nations in the world. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) measured the sales volume of cigarettes sold by domestic manufacturers to wholesalers and retailers across the country at $173.5 billion in 2022.', 'More than 480,000 Americans die from smoking cigarettes each year, accounting for one in five deaths in the country, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – making it the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. In 2021, more than 28 million Americans smoked cigarettes, while over 16 million lived with a smoking-related disease. However, on the brighter side, the percentage of Americans who smoke has come down drastically from 20.9% of the population in 2005 to 11.5% in 2021.', 'The drop has likely been triggered by an increased awareness about the risks associated with smoking – in particular by tar and nicotine found in them. These are two of the most harmful substances found in cigarettes. According to a report, about 70% of the tar remains in the lungs after a smoker inhales cigarette smoke, while nicotine is what gets individuals addicted to cigarettes – making it difficult for them to quit even if they want to.', 'Considering the risks involved, a lot of people have begun looking for ‘healthier options’ in cigarettes that contain low tar and nicotine, as well as alternatives to smoking cigarettes with products such as snuff, snus, and nicotine pouches. That being said, even consuming cigarettes with low amounts of harmful chemicals and using alternatives like smokeless tobacco have risks and can lead to deadly diseases.', 'Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in September 2023 unveiled its zero-tobacco heat stick that is used with its IQOS device, which heats small packets of tobacco in the stick instead of burning it. The company believes the new product is likely to reduce health risks compared to smoking cigarettes. According to Reuters, the heat stick may also help Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in avoiding taxes currently affecting its tobacco products.', 'Last year, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) acquired Swedish Match, a Stockholm-based nicotine pouch maker, for a deal worth $16 billion. The Swedish company has made huge strides over the last few years to reduce the harm associated with tobacco products, with its wide range of smoke-free products – the most prominent being ZYN, its nicotine pouch. The acquisition is part of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s strategy to be a predominantly smoke-free corporation by 2025.', 'Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), based in Richmond, also made inroads in the nicotine pouch industry in 2019, after purchasing 80% stake in Swiss tobacco firm Burger Sohne’s global businesses for an agreement valued at $372 million. The deal, which will involve Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) distributing Burger Sohne’s nicotine pouch brand On in the US and Canada, is the company’s latest attempt to develop a portfolio of products beyond cigarettes. According to a report, On was well received in the American market, especially among female consumers. By the end of 2020, the number of stores in the US selling the brand had nearly doubled by when it was first launched by Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in 2019.', 'The British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) has been shifting focus toward alternatives to smoking as well, and has dedicated itself to the commercialization of its ‘reduced-risk’ product line of vapes, tobacco heating products, and oral offerings such as the tobacco-free nicotine pouches, moist snuff, and snus. According to the company’s website, these products have found traction among the general public. Revenues for vapes were 55% higher in 2022 compared to 2021, while sales were also up 24% for its tobacco-heating device, glo, during the same time period.', 'defotoberg / Shutterstock.com', 'Cigarette brands with the least chemicals in the world are listed based on the amounts of tar and nicotine present in various brands. We searched for cigarettes with the lowest concentration of these two chemicals on online cigarette selling websites like KiwiCigs, CigsClub, and Tobacco Near. Features and ingredients of cigarettes were mentioned on these websites.', ""Since most of the cigarettes shortlisted had identical, lower concentration levels of nicotine and tar, we used price ranges of these cigarettes as a tiebreaker, with those priced lower outranking the pricey ones. Prices were taken from the above three mentioned sources, with prices varying on each source. Therefore, we have mentioned the price ranges of these cigarettes in the list section, depending on how they were priced on these sources. We searched for prices of these individual cigarettes on their manufacturer's websites, but they were not listed in a majority of the cases, and so we had to consider how they were being priced at online stores."", 'Slim cigarettes were omitted from our rankings because they are not as widely used and available in the market as the regular cigarettes are.', ""Please note that the prices can vary from place to place and we don't guarantee their accuracy."", 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:ROP). The company's stock saw its share price hover around a small range of US$517 to US$562 over the last few weeks. But is this actually reflective of the share value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Roper Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Roper Technologies ', ""Good news, investors! Roper Technologies is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $722.09, but it is currently trading at US$546 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Roper Technologies’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Roper Technologies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? Since ROP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ROP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ROP.

(NYSE:HCA) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 29th of March to $0.66. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 0.9%, which is below the industry average."", ' See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare ', ""While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, HCA Healthcare's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 31.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 11%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""Even in its relatively short history, the company has reduced the dividend at least once. If the company cuts once, it definitely isn't argument against the possibility of it cutting in the future. The annual payment during the last 6 years was $1.40 in 2018, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. We are encouraged to see that HCA Healthcare has grown earnings per share at 13% per year over the past five years. HCA Healthcare definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio."", 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

At the beginning of the past week, the stocks were hard hit as fresh inflation data raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s pledge for a slew of rate cuts this year. The U.S. consumer price index for January was up 0.3% month-over-month and 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. This compared unfavorably with broad-based expectations of 0.2% and 2.95, respectively, triggering a sudden downtrend.Mid-way through the week, stocks closed at record highs riding on solid quarterly performance by some blue-chip firms. The stock market resilience, as exhibited by the 11th record high mark that the benchmark index cinched so far this year, more than offset the decline. However, the market slid on the following day as fresh inflation data rattled investors. Recent data revealed that the producer price index for January, a measure of wholesale inflation, increased 0.3% against broad-based expectations of a gain of 0.1%.\xa0 \xa0To add to the woes, Fed governor Christopher Waller indicated that the easing of monetary policy might come slower than anticipated, although the Fed had earlier pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a slowdown in inflation in the later stages of 2023. Given the recent inflationary data, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL, HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA and América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. AMX are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters.

(NYSE: GPN) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.75 billion in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2031 (the ""Convertible Notes""). The Company also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Convertible Notes are issued, up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes.', 'The Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to December 1, 2030, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Convertible Notes will be convertible, on the terms set forth in the indenture, into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, initial conversion price and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of the pricing of the offering.', 'The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to March 6, 2028. The Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes, at its option, on or after March 6, 2028, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.', 'In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional Convertible Notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.', 'The Company expects to use up to $300 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock from purchasers of the Convertible Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through one of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes or its affiliate. These repurchases could increase, or prevent a decrease in, the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes concurrently with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the Convertible Notes. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings and any accrued and unpaid interest under its commercial paper program, and also to repay borrowings and any accrued and unpaid interest under its revolving credit agreement, and any prepayment premium, penalty or other amount, if any, due in connection with any such repayment, and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt.', 'The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of any Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.', 'In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the Company expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect holders’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following any conversion of the Convertible Notes or during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that holders of the Convertible Notes will receive upon conversion of such Convertible Notes.', 'The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes, and any shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any state securities laws, and neither the Convertible Notes nor any shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.

Some cycles are long-term, taking decades to unfold, and some are short-term, lasting months, weeks, or even days. Many are medium in length, lasting two, three, or several years. Most cycles occur because a trend often creates the seeds of its own reversal. We at Madison Investments are certain that market cycles will occur, but it doesn’t mean we can predict their timing or magnitude. We don’t think we can. This is perhaps a major difference between us and many other investors. Most investors believe it’s their job to time market cycles despite overwhelming evidence that it’s nearly impossible to do so with enough accuracy to make such an effort profitable over long periods. We avoid making calls about market cycles and spend zero minutes thinking about them, not because we don’t think they can be important, but because we think they’re inherently unpredictable in duration.', 'This mentality of our team is generally true for other kinds of cycles, such as macroeconomic, industry, or company-specific, but is a bit more nuanced for those.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NextEra Energy, it has a TSR of -23% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.

The utility has more than a quarter century of dividend increases under its belt. These haven't been token raises to keep its streak alive.

Again, it's targeting roughly 10% annual dividend growth off this year's base, this time through at least 2026.

That would put its total growth rate around 9.4% annually since 2021. ', 'Meanwhile, the company can grow its payout faster than its projected earnings growth rate because it has a strong financial profile. CEO John Ketchum noted in the press release unveiling its updated dividend policy that the company had a ""59% payout ratio at the end of 2023, below the peer average of approximately 65%."" That lower dividend payout ratio gives it more room to increase its payment. NextEra also boasts of having a strong balance sheet. That gives it additional financial flexibility to fund its growth while increasing the dividend.

A big driver is the growth that still lies ahead."", ""The company estimates that the U.S. economy will need to add 250 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy and storage capacity in the 2027 to 2030 timeframe. That's 43% more than the company expects the country to add between 2023 and 2026. Meanwhile, the longer-term opportunity is even larger. NextEra Energy estimates that the U.S. economy will need to invest $4 trillion to build 7,000 GWs of renewable energy and storage capacity by 2050 to fully decarbonize. "", ""NextEra Energy is in an excellent position to capitalize on this opportunity because it's already a leader in the field. It has the scale to develop renewable energy more efficiently and cost-effectively compared to smaller rivals. It also has a cost of capital advantage thanks to its strong financial position, which allows it to fund its growth at lower rates. These factors should enable it to develop projects at lower costs and higher returns, putting it in a strong position to capture lots of future growth opportunities."", ""On top of that, the company is increasingly investing in adjacent sectors to add new growth platforms. For example, it's an early investor in green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to produce an emissions-free fuel source. Green hydrogen could be a significant growth driver beyond 2026. It's also building new electricity transmission lines to transmit renewable energy to the grid. "", ""NextEra Energy has been a magnificent dividend stock over the years by growing its payout at a high rate. That should continue in the future. Given its attractive yield (currently 3.3%), NextEra's growing earnings and payout could give it the fuel to produce strong total returns.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments."", ""Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in Focus', ""The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 5.96% since the start of the year. The company is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.05% compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.93% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.62%."", ""Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 6.3% from last year. In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.67%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend."", 'Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $5.23 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.56%.', 'Bottom Line', 'Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.', ""High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, BK presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy)."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

References to quarterly or annual figures increasing, decreasing or remaining flat are in comparison to fiscal year 2023.', ""Medtronic management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying operational performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the med tech industry. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the effect of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings but that result from transactions or events that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments). Medtronic generally uses non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and investors are cautioned that Medtronic may calculate non-GAAP financial measures in a way that is different from other companies.

For instance, forward-looking organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as significant acquisitions or divestitures. Forward-looking diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance also excludes other potential charges or gains that would be recorded as Non-GAAP Adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Medtronic does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP EPS guidance to projected GAAP EPS guidance because the combined impact and timing of recognition of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.

Miller, the founder of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) (""Crown Castle"" or the ""Company"") has nominated a slate of four director nominees to the Crown Castle board of directors (the ""Board""). Their full biographical information is available at the end of this release. Below is the text of a letter sent by Mr. Miller, on behalf of his investment vehicle Boots Capital Management, to the Crown Castle Chairman, P. Robert Bartolo.', 'Dear Rob:', 'This is a pivotal moment for the future of the company I founded, Crown Castle Inc. Like you, I believe that Crown Castle must be rebooted after the shameful adventure into fiber, which has cost investors tens of billions and turned the global industry-leader into a ridiculed laggard.', 'But raising questions is not the same as answering them. While Elliott Investment Management L.P. (""Elliott"") and the Board have brought on new directors and hopeful concepts about the future, my six months of discussions with the largest fundamental shareholders, customers and employees surfaced the same plea: Crown Castle lacks leadership, expertise, vision and urgency. It needs a plan.', 'The CEO has resigned, the current CFO has resigned and un-resigned, there is a revolving door of fiber leadership, the EVP/COO of Towers has left, a major employee location has been shuttered and reopened, the company still trades at a 15-20% enterprise-value discount to peers, and the\xa0 share price reflects skepticism about a potential fiber sale and what comes after.', ""Well, we've got a plan."", ""A plan that brings leadership, expertise, vision and urgency. We have readied world-class tower know-how – across every aspect of the business – to execute that plan and act as the single best insurance policy for Crown Castle's long-suffering shareholders."", 'I would serve as Executive Chairman, and Chuck, Tripp and David as directors. We would help the Board and collaborate with both the interim and new CEO to accomplish the following objectives for all stakeholders:', ""Get fiber sold. My fellow nominees and I have spent the last six months and $5 million in direct, personal cost, dissecting every dimension of the fiber transaction including leading a due diligence process with 25 prospective buyers and financing sources to increase speed and certainty of a transaction for Crown Castle's benefit. We have analyzed the status and financing capacity of each potential buyer, the optimal buyer structure, carveout economics, and go-forward financials for Crown Castle. In our discussions with the Board, not one Board member ever asked to see this extensive work.The fiber and small-cell assets are of high quality, and our model anticipates Crown Castle retaining a minority interest, but it's clear they belong in the hands of operators who are most comfortable in that business. Our models showed that Crown Castle could go all the way to 2050 and never earn back its own cost of capital. Sadly, the facts show that Crown Castle would be worth tens of billions more today if it had simply held on to its international towers and never ventured into fiber."", 'Capture tax benefits. We have detailed to you and the broader Board the need for the completion of the fiber transaction in 2024. There are significant tax benefits, estimated by our accounting advisers at $1 billion-plus, that expire at the end of 2024.\xa0', 'Relentlessly focus as a pure-play US TowerCo. Freed from fiber, Crown Castle becomes a pure-play US tower company, with what should be a substantially attractive trading multiple that we estimate at 25 times Ebitda. This will finally close the decade-long valuation gap between Crown Castle and SBA Communications Corp. and American Tower Corp.', 'Buyback shares. Add in $1.9 billion of buybacks from the proceeds of the fiber sale and enhance near-term and future shareholder returns.', ""Run the company much more efficiently. In 2013, Crown Castle owned 40,000 towers and employed 1,400. Today it still owns 40,000 towers and employs 2,200 people across that business line, even after a 750-person reduction. How can the Company have gotten less efficient over time given so many advances in technology? Elliott has rightly had similar observations.We will drive change to improve this. I founded this company and this industry. And I have devoted the last two decades of my life to advancing the technology that serves this industry. With this direct, functional knowledge we intend to use digital-twin and AI technology to reduce customer rebalance and rollout times, while reducing service costs by an estimated 40% during the tower lifecycle. Currently Crown Castle has 18 towers for each employee, the worst among the major three providers. We target taking that number to 23 for each employee by 2026 which is in line with AMT's US tower operations.\xa0 We believe additional gains can be achieved because Crown Castle operated in 2013 with 29 towers per employee."", ""Repair a broken company culture.\xa0I founded this company with the hard work and shared values of dedicated employees. I have been horrified by the stories employees have conveyed to me over the last six months. In my opinion, their public comments show a company rotting from the top, managed by financial engineers and not actual operators. With interest rates having changed so drastically, this financial-engineering chapter of Crown Castle's life is over. It is time to get back to operational basics. And I am ready to be the principled leader – supporting both the interim and new CEO – to help fill this vacuum. Restoring a positive and productive company culture is essential to driving shareholder value."", 'Build a better go-to-market relationship with carriers. We are also focused on creating value over a longer 24 to 36 month period. Once we spend the next two years fixing Crown Castle, we have a longer-term detailed approach to help customers access new communications infrastructure that captures immense opportunities in edge compute, Internet of Things, satellite connectivity, private networks, public services and autonomous transportation.\xa0', ""Delivering materially improved financials. Clearing a fiber transaction, running a tighter organization, and paying down debt has material financial benefits for all shareholders. That includes our projections to:Take AFFO after discretionary CapEx to over $5 per share by 2025, up from its current $3 per share.Take AFFO after Discretionary Capex and Dividend from a $1.3 billion DEFICIT to a positive $200 million.Drive EBITDA Margin per tower from 70% toward 75-80% in line with Crown Castle's peers AMT and SBA.The current dividend is funded with debt and, in my view, is unsustainable. Our plan is to payout 90%, translating to a dividend of $4.62/share in 2025 with annual growth of 6-7%. This is accomplished with 5.4x leverage to maintain the Company's investment grade status.Reduce total debt to approximately $17 billion, freeing up capacity for future initiatives once we get the house in order over the next two-plus years.Pay off all floating rate debt eliminating interest rate exposure for the Company.Paydown/buyout $4 billion of fixed rate debt and reduce fixed rate maturities between now and 2026 by 15%."", 'The bottom line for shareholders: We estimate that this detailed plan supports 2026 Ebitda that takes Crown Castle shares to $150 to $160. ', '•', ""It is my direct experience – in the lab and field, responding directly to customers – which made me see both the failings of Crown Castle's management and the virtues of a business that Elliott rightly describes as one of the best businesses in the world."", ""Knowing the potential locked inside Crown Castle, I have never been more excited about an investment opportunity for all stakeholders. It's why I've got real skin in the game -- $100 million of capital from myself and select investors – to aid this transformation. This is a sum greater than the entire 12-person Board's company-granted holdings in Crown Castle, and it is a far greater amount than their personal purchases."", 'And unlike common hedge fund practice, our position is not hedged in a way that minimizes or fully eliminates true economic exposure. We deeply believe in what this company can and should be.', 'We shared our 39-page plan (a redacted version of which we are releasing today) with you on a 90-minute Board call on January 30. Perhaps most revealing was that during my Board interview, one director questioned whether we were ""too in the weeds.""', 'It was a poignant remark from a Board that only met four times a year in both 2021 and 2022, the latter of which was a period when the stock lost 35% of its value. American Tower directors met 18 times in that same period.', ""Yes, we're in the weeds. It's what shareholders expect and demand of their Board. Board members should be also."", '•', ""It's important we address stakeholders on another major factor in this situation: The Board's settlement and Cooperation Agreement with Elliott. While it does not have our tower expertise or our fiber due diligence, Elliott has insights and sophistication which we value around the board table."", ""Standstill agreements are of course common. But we still find that the bargain struck between the Board and this investor presents real concerns. Major shareholders to whom we've spoken are troubled and want an explanation as to why the agreement was struck prior to the nomination window, and why our communications with the Board were ignored going back to August, 2023, and in December in advance of the Elliott agreement."", ""What's more, the Cooperation Agreement enshrines Elliott as the de facto controller of the Company, with direct influence at the board level and across the committees that control Crown Castle's strategic future. (We are attaching our earlier attorney letter that more fully outlines these deficiencies.)"", 'Our fear is that this bargain with Elliott deprived shareholders of what was best for the Company, not just what was expedient for the directors. That became clear when one Crown Castle official told us early in our discussions, that you wished we ""had gotten there a few weeks before"" the agreement with Elliott.', ""The Company has offered stockholders no explanation for the Board's decision to give Elliott such dominance, nor has it reassured stockholders that Elliott is sufficiently disinterested to act with the best interests of all stockholders, stakeholders and employees in mind."", ""Surely, they would also like to know the full background of Elliott's economic exposure to Crown Castle and, as suggested by some in our research, has any intentions of financing a fiber carve-out."", 'The facts get even more upsetting for long-term shareholders. Just 85 days ago, Elliott touted its ""investment of approximately $2 billion"" in Crown Castle. The most recent 13(f) filing lists Elliott\'s investment at $141 million. That means that before the nomination window even closed on February 17, Elliott shed 93% of its stated investment exposure. It\'s even possible that Elliott could exit its position entirely before the shareholder vote. Remarkably, the Crown Castle Board did not specifically require Elliott maintain ownership thresholds to keep these privileges.', 'There is a straightforward solution to all this: Promptly submit the Cooperation Agreement to a stockholder vote.\xa0Doing so would resolve any concerns about transparency and make clear that the Board will reflect the will of all stockholders, not just Elliott. Doing so is also the best way to forestall litigation, costly distraction, and potential delay of a fiber sale, all of which would prevent the Company from realizing significant value for its stockholders.', '•', ""To improve the prospects for all Crown Castle shareholders, I have nominated four directors to the board. Myself; Chuck Green, one of the world's leading authorities on tower operations and economics and the Crown Castle CFO at the time of the Company's IPO in 1998; Tripp Rice, from my family office 4M investments and my son-in-law, who has built our investment thesis from the ground up with extensive understanding of CCI's operational and financial problems and opportunities; and David Wheeler, one of the most sophisticated students of tower finance from a 35+-year career at Credit Suisse and other leading institutions. Each of their bios is appended to this letter."", '•', 'Rob, I welcome a personal dialogue that has eluded us since August. No director even had the courtesy to tell me directly our nominations were not recommended by the Board.', ""We hope to find a consensual way to bring our best resources to help a company that is in my bones and that I love. This love compels me to take this step, on behalf of confused employees, frustrated customers, and disappointed shareholders. We've got the plan to make things right again."", '•', 'ADVISERS', 'Strategic: Woolery & Co.Legal: Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLPProxy Solicitor: Morrow Sodali LLPCommunications: Gasthalter & Co.', 'INVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS', 'Investors:Morrow SodaliBy Phone: 1-800-662-5200 or 203-658-9400By Email: Boots@info.morrowsodali.com', 'Media:Jonathan Gasthalter/Nathaniel Garnick/Grace CartwrightGasthalter & Co.By Phone: 212-257-4170By Email: bootscapital@gasthalter.com', 'CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS', 'The information herein contains ""forward-looking statements.""

Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.', 'Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.', 'QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%.

Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.', 'Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.', 'Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.', 'Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.', 'Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.', 'Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.', 'Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.', 'Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.', 'Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.', 'Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.', 'Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.', 'Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.', 'Adverse Reactions', 'In DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

They spent seven years working with companies to remove the bureaucratic sludge that slows down organizations and thus are able to combine the best of academic behavioral science with real world examples.', 'But what really makes this book compelling is that, while citing pointless and soul-crushing friction as the biggest problem most companies face, it also recognizes that sometimes friction is good.

Some of my takeaways:', 'Start with self-awareness. CEOs frequently complain that it’s middle management that mucks up execution. But Sutton and Rao found many leaders whose own habits prolonged meetings, wasted time, and misdirected others in countless ways. “If you wield influence over others, you may become oblivious to the inconveniences that you heap on the people below you, and that your organizations heaps on clients and customers.” Best to think of yourself as a steward of your employees’\xa0time, as well as\xa0your clients\xa0and your customers.', 'Champion subtraction projects. “Humans default to asking\xa0‘What can I add here?’, not\xa0‘What can I get rid of?’”\xa0Friction-fighters create new rituals to ensure the opposite.

The\xa0“move fast and break things”\xa0approach clearly has its limits—ask anyone at Boeing. Sutton and Rao advise applying friction at key moments, particularly when irreversible and costly decisions are about to be made.\xa0One suggestion: take a pause to conduct a\xa0“pre-victorem”\xa0or a\xa0“pre-mortem,”\xa0imagining in advance the reasons why your project or product ultimately succeeded or failed.', 'There’s a lot more in this rich book, and it is presented in an entertaining style.\xa0Count it as 2024’s first addition to your canon of business books.

This is a crucial step in the start-up testing sequence.

The nuclear fuel in the reactor will split the atoms and generate heat, which will be used to produce steam later.', 'Following this achievement, Vogtle Unit 4 has continued startup testing. The tests are meant to show the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system under conditions of design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. These tests are performed before kicking off commercial operations, in order to validate operating procedures and verify the synergism of all systems.', 'However, the project has encountered delays and is running behind schedule. The budget has also been exceeded by billions.', 'As the Unit 4 reactor has reached initial criticality, the operators will gradually raise power to synchronize the generator with the electric grid and begin generating electricity. The power will be increased by the operators in multiple steps, ultimately raising it to 100%.', 'Unit 4 is one of the two-unit expansion projects being constructed near Waynesboro, GA, and the reactor is expected to come in during the second quarter of 2024. Initially, the projected in-service date for Vogtle 4 was around the end of 2023. However, that was revised after the discovery of a motor fault in the reactor coolant pump. Southern Company’s newest reactor in the United States, Unit 3, started commercial operation in July last year.', 'The company will operate these units on behalf of the co-owners — Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.', 'Georgia Power, the largest electric subsidiary of SO, mentioned that the new Vogtle units are part of its overall commitment to deliver energy that is clean, safe, reliable and affordable for its customers.

A total of four billionaire asset managers made hefty purchases for their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (29,512,760 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (19,054,972 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (4,970,954 shares)', 'Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,143,449 shares)', ""The lure for these billionaires, aside from AT&T's delectable 6.5% yield, is likely Wall Street's overreaction to a few headwinds facing the company."", ""For example, AT&T was clobbered this past July after a report from The Wall Street Journal alleged that legacy telecom operators could face sizable environmental and health-related liabilities tied to their use of lead-sheathed cables. However, AT&T countered by noting that its testing hasn't revealed a health hazard to people or the environment. Even if there's some form of financial liability in the future for AT&T, it would almost certainly be decided in America's notoriously slow court system. In short, it's not something investors should concern themselves with for the time being."", 'AT&T was also weighed down by the Federal Reserve undertaking its most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. Most legacy telecom companies are carrying around a lot of debt, which means future refinancing and/or debt-driven deals will be costlier.', ""The thing is, AT&T's balance sheet has markedly improved since divesting content arm WarnerMedia in April 2022. Over the past seven quarters, ended Dec. 31, 2023, AT&T's net debt has declined from $169 billion to $128.9 billion. While there's still work to do to improve the company's financial flexibility, AT&T's dividend is undeniably safe."", ""Lastly, AT&T's network upgrades have allowed it to benefit from the ongoing 5G revolution. Increased data consumption is boosting wireless segment sales. Meanwhile, the company logged its sixth consecutive year of at least 1 million net broadband additions in 2023. Broadband customers are the perfect target for high-margin service bundling."", ""A second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that billionaire investors were clamoring to buy during the December-ended quarter is pharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Three prominent billionaires significantly added to their fund's existing stakes, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):"", 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (10,947,182 shares)', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,343,112 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (5,282,369 shares)', ""Somewhat similar to AT&T, the lure for Yass, Griffin, and Englander may be a downside overreaction by Wall Street to Pfizer's declining sales and profits following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""There's no question that Pfizer was a prime beneficiary of the pandemic, from an operating standpoint. In 2022, the company sold more than $56 billion, combined, of its vaccine (Comirnaty) and its oral treatment (Paxlovid). In 2024, these two therapies are expected to generate just $8 billion in combined sales. This inflating and deflating of Pfizer's sales has had quite the negative impact on its share price."", ""But interestingly enough, Pfizer's sales continued to grow in 2023 (up 7%), if you exclude the impact of its COVID-19 therapies -- and they're liable to expand again in 2024. Despite the proverbial low-hanging fruit from the pandemic being in the rearview mirror, exceptional pricing power and innovation are continuing to lead the way."", ""Furthermore, Wall Street may be overreacting to Pfizer's tempered guidance in 2024 following its acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen. Despite a $0.40-per-share hit to the company's earnings per share this year, Pfizer's acquisition should result in long-term cost synergies, as well as meaningfully expand the company's pipeline and sales trajectory in oncology."", ""Billionaires may also be attracted to the defensive nature of healthcare stocks. We don't have the luxury of choosing when we become ill or what ailment(s) we develop. Regardless of how the U.S. economy is performing, there will always be demand for novel therapeutics. This means consistent operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate for big drug companies like Pfizer."", ""However, not every supercharged dividend stock has been on the buy list of Wall Street's most-successful asset managers. During the fourth quarter, we witnessed five well-known billionaires run for the exit from mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC), including (total shares sold in parenthesis):"", 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,332,796 shares)', 'Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,559,922 shares)', 'John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,501,624 shares)', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (300,555 shares)', ""The likeliest reason four out of five of these billionaires ditched their respective fund's stakes in AGNC during the fourth quarter -- only Yass's Susquehanna still holds a small position -- is the yield curve."", ""Mortgage REITs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Companies like AGNC want to borrow money at low short-term rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets. Rapidly rising interest rates, which can increase short-term borrowing costs, and inverted yield curves, which lessen net interest margin, tend to disrupt AGNC Investment's operating model. An inverted yield curve is where short-dated bills maturing in a year or less bear higher yields than bonds set to mature in, say, 10 or 30 years."", ""During the fourth quarter, the yield inversion between the 10-year Treasury bond and three-month T-bill steepened to levels not seen since July 2023. A steepening of the yield curve likely portends a decline in AGNC's book value and/or a shrinking of its net interest margin."", ""Although billionaires decisively sold AGNC Investment and its whopping 15.2% yield in the fourth quarter, I believe there could be light at the end of the tunnel for the company. While the operating performance of mortgage REITs doesn't turn on a dime, history suggests a normalization of the yield curve sooner than later. When the yield curve does normalize, an expansion of the company's net interest margin would be expected."", ""Additionally, the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening measures mean it's stopped purchasing mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which is what AGNC primarily invests in. With the nation's central bank out of the way, it'll be far easier for AGNC to secure higher-yield and lucrative MBSs in the future."", 'Best of all, AGNC almost exclusively invests its $60.2 billion portfolio into agency assets. ""Agency"" securities are backed by the federal government in the event of default. This provides some level of protection to AGNC\'s investments and allows the company to lever its portfolio to maximize its profit.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

The 17 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.', 'Total Q4 earnings for these 17 retailers that have reported are up +72.4% from the same period last year on +10.7% higher revenues, with 88.2% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.', 'The online players and restaurant operators easily beat EPS estimates but have struggled to beat top-line estimates.', 'Concerning the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 17 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +410.9% on +13.9% higher revenues, beating top and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a massive boost from the Covid lockdowns.', 'We have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution. One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.', 'We will hear more about issues on the Q4 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.', 'The overall picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration in the growth momentum.Earnings aren’t great, but no one expected corporate profitability to be strong. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.', 'With quarterly results from more than 79% of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 16th, here are the five key features that these quarterly results have confirmed.', 'First, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have seen in recent quarters.', 'The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.', 'For the 396 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 16th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.1% and +3.4% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 78.8% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 64.4% have beaten revenue estimates.', 'Second, companies are making good progress on the margins front.', 'The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.', 'At the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance, and others.', 'On the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Medical, Autos, Energy, and Transportation sectors.', 'Third, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.', 'For the 79.4% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +20.5% on +6.1% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.7% beating revenue estimates.', 'Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues.', 'The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.', 'Please remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector but rather the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively.', 'This means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively. The sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historically positive growth role.', 'Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.1% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.', 'Fourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.', 'Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.', 'Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.8% on +14.5% higher revenues.', 'The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.', 'Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory if not for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.', 'Five, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.', 'Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.', 'For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Results Paint a Positive Earnings Picture ', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $5.55 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.56% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oneok?', ""For Oneok, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.75%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Oneok will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oneok would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.99, delivering a surprise of +1.02%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Oneok appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' View our latest analysis for Oracle ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$10.4b', 'US$12.0b', 'US$15.2b', 'US$23.7b', 'US$27.3b', 'US$30.0b', 'US$32.2b', 'US$34.2b', 'US$35.8b', 'US$37.3b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x14', 'Analyst x16', 'Analyst x11', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 9.82%', 'Est @ 7.56%', 'Est @ 5.98%', 'Est @ 4.87%', 'Est @ 4.10%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% ', 'US$9.7k', 'US$10.4k', 'US$12.2k', 'US$17.7k', 'US$18.9k', 'US$19.3k', 'US$19.3k', 'US$19.0k', 'US$18.5k', 'US$17.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$163b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$37b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.3%) = US$719b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$719b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$346b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$509b.

Relative to the current share price of US$111, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.153. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The company launched Casgevy, a one-time curative gene editing treatment for blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And Vertex recently reported positive data from trials of its pain management candidate and aims to file for regulatory review this year."", ""All of this is great and could result in billions of dollars in revenue. But Vertex also recently announced some news that may ensure its dominance in CF, which last year generated more than $9.8 billion in product revenue for the company. Vertex in the past said it's set to dominate the CF market through the mid-2030s, but this latest step could extend that further. That's because Vertex soon aims to file for regulatory review of a CF candidate that may even beat its biggest blockbuster. Let's find out more."", ""First, a bit of background on Vertex's CF portfolio. The company develops CFTR modulators, pills taken twice daily to correct the functioning of a particular protein. And this helps regulate the flow of water and chloride through the cells of various organs, including the lungs. The products, led by Vertex's most recent blockbuster, Trikafta, have been transformative for patients, improving quality of life and extending lives."", 'In recent times, Vertex has shepherded a new candidate through the pipeline and says it plans to file for regulatory review by the middle of this year. Vertex demonstrated in clinical trials that this candidate, known as the ""vanza triple"" (a combination of vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor), actually outperforms the company\'s star drug, Trikafta.', 'The vanza triple showed its non-inferior to Trikafta in improving lung function. And the candidate beat Trikafta when it comes to lowering sweat chloride levels -- these levels are high in CF patients because they have trouble clearing chloride from their cells. On top of this, the vanza triple is a once-daily pill, offering an easy regimen to follow.', ""Results were particularly impressive in Vertex's studies of children as, on the vanza triple, 95% achieved sweat chloride levels below the cut off level for a positive CF test. And 50% reached carrier levels, a level associated with no manifestation of disease symptoms."", ""So, there's reason to be optimistic about an approval as well as uptake of this potential gamechanger. As for uptake, the company expects the vanza triple to interest patients who've discontinued Trikafta due to a side effect or difficulty following the twice-daily treatment regimen. And the company says even patients doing well on Trikafta likely will want to progress to this latest option."", ""Now, let's turn to Vertex's market position. Trikafta's patent expires in 2037, meaning the company's prediction of leadership through that point looks sound. The vanza triple clearly could extend this, as it's a newer candidate, and patents are granted for 20 years from the filing date. Vertex also should benefit because its royalty burden on the vanza triple is lower than on its other CF drugs -- lower in the single digits compared to just under 10% for the CF portfolio today."", ""All of this means the vanza triple is big news for Vertex and could be the key to the biotech extending its leadership in the billion-dollar CF market over the long haul. Of course, Vertex's newer programs are exciting, but we shouldn't underestimate the potential of its older business to renew itself and grow."", ""CF has been a huge revenue machine for the company, and the vanza triple may drive another wave of billion-dollar earnings growth over the years to come at this top biotech player. That's great news for investors who buy the stock today and for those who have been holding on to it since the earlier days of the company's CF story."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The idea is to fix faulty genes responsible for disease, and the result can be spectacular, producing functional cures.', 'CRISPR Therapeutics reached an enormous milestone late last year when the UK authorized Casgevy, its treatment for blood disorders, marking the first ever regulatory nod for a CRISPR-based therapeutic. The U.S. went on to approve Casgevy in its two indications, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.', 'The gene editing specialist is partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals for this particular product, and this represents a big advantage: Vertex, an experienced player in manufacturing and commercialization, is at the helm here and bears the largest share of development costs -- 60%. Even though Vertex also takes 60% of profits, this deal is a smart one for CRISPR Therapeutics, allowing the company to pocket its first ever product revenue and focus on pipeline growth.', 'And speaking of the pipeline, CRISPR Therapeutics also is advancing promising immuno-oncology candidates through clinical trials, so if all goes well, the biotech could bring at least one additional product to market later this decade.', ""All of this means now makes a great time to follow Cathie Wood's lead and get in on this innovator early."", ""Intellia currently makes up a little more than 3% of Wood's healthcare fund, as the 14th largest position. The company doesn't yet have a product on the market, but it's reached an important point, with many catalysts just ahead."", ""First, it's important to note that the regulatory approvals of CRISPR Therapeutics' product is positive for companies in the CRISPR gene editing field, indicating regulators are willing to help bring such treatments to market if trial data are strong. Another plus is Intellia and CRISPR Therapeutics are focusing on different disease areas, so at the moment, they aren't competitors."", ""Intellia's most advanced candidates are NTLA-2001, treating transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), and NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema (HAE). ATTR is caused by accumulation of a misfolded protein and impacts various organs such as the heart, while HAE is a condition characterized by sudden and extreme swelling."", ""The company's priorities from now through 2026 include completing patient enrollment for pivotal studies of both of these candidates and applying for regulatory approval of NTLA-2002. Intellia also plans on launching a wave of clinical trials for new candidates during this time period and innovating in the area of gene editing and the delivery of these potential treatments."", 'Meanwhile, trial data reports could determine the direction of the shares over the next couple of years. And speaking of the share price, Intellia shares have shown movement similar to those of CRISPR Therapeutics over time, but the stock price remains significantly lower.', 'CRSP data by YCharts', ""It's possible, though, that positive data readouts and an eventual product approval could help them catch up with their more advanced peer. Considering the company's progress so far, it's not surprising Wood is loading up on shares -- and if you're comfortable with a bit of risk, you may want to add a few to your portfolio too."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

For one, AbbVie has a diverse business, with aesthetics, immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and eye care all providing the company with many different avenues to grow its business in the long run."", ""AbbVie's most recent results look a little disappointing. For the last three months of 2023, revenue fell 5% year over year to $14.3 billion. The biggest reason for the decline was Humira sales, which were down 41% as it battles growing competition now that it has lost exclusivity."", ""The positive is that AbbVie recently upgraded the guidance of its two newer immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which it is leaning on to make up for Humira's lost sales in the future. Combined, the company expects the two drugs will generate $27 billion in sales by 2027. Previously, AbbVie was forecasting their combined sales to top just $21 billion."", 'AbbVie has also been relying on acquisitions to open up even more growth opportunities. This month, it acquired oncology company ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion. The company makes antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which are promising medicines in the fight against cancer. In December, AbbVie announced it was buying neuroscience company Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion in a move that it says will advance its pipeline within that segment.', ""Based on analysts' future earnings estimates, AbbVie's stock is only trading at a multiple of 15 times its expected profits, which is well below the S&P 500 average of 22. On top of all this growth potential, the stock also offers investors a dividend that yields 3.6%."", 'Keith Speights (Eli Lilly): Shares of Eli Lilly have skyrocketed nearly 120% over the last 12 months. Along the way, Lilly has claimed the mantle as the biggest drugmaker in the world based on market cap. I think more impressive growth should be on the way.', ""Lilly's new weight-loss drug Zepbound raked in close to $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 with less than one month on the market. I won't be surprised if Zepbound becomes one of the top-selling drugs of all time within the next few years."", ""Zepbound's sibling, Mounjaro, is already a huge winner. Both drugs use the same active ingredient (tirzepatide). But while Zepbound targets weight loss, Mounjaro is approved for treating type 2 diabetes. It generated sales of nearly $5.2 billion last year, with $2.2 billion of that total coming in Q4."", ""These two sibling products aren't Lilly's only big growth drivers. The company's lineup includes six other drugs with double-digit percentage sales growth in 2023. Two of them are blockbusters -- cancer drug Verzenio and diabetes drug Jardiance."", ""Lilly's pipeline also seems likely to soon contribute additional growth. The company awaits U.S. regulatory approvals for experimental Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab and atopic dermatitis candidate lebrikizumab."", ""The main negative for Lilly right now is its valuation. The big pharma stock trades at a whopping 60 times expected earnings. However, this metric doesn't factor in Lilly's tremendous growth prospects over the next decade. I think the stock should have plenty of room to run."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): There aren't too many biotech giants that have performed better than Vertex Pharmaceuticals in the past decade. The drugmaker's laser focus on its cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise through this period has proved highly lucrative. Revenue and earnings have grown rapidly, and Vertex has continued to deliver significant clinical and regulatory progress within its central field of expertise."", ""But things are changing with the biotech. To be clear, the details are changing, but the company's future, in terms of overall performance, should look much like its past. Vertex is now expanding beyond CF."", 'Last year, it earned approval for Casgevy, a therapy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. It recently reported positive results from a late-stage study for VX-548, a potential treatment for acute and neuropathic pain. Vertex hopes that VX-548 will replace opioid-based pain treatments that come with severe side effects.', ""Casgevy and VX-548 should significantly contribute to Vertex's top-line growth in the midterm. The biotech has several more exciting programs in the pipeline that could yield important regulatory wins within the next five years as well."", ""The lesson for investors is clear: Though no one can go back in time and invest in Vertex stock a decade ago, the company has all the tools it needs to produce similarly impressive returns in the next 10 years, and likely beyond. That's why it is worth investing in this fantastic growth stock right now and holding onto its shares for a long time."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here, you need to identify quality large-cap companies that thrive across market cycles and generate steady cash flows. Generally, blue-chip companies allocate a portion of these cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends. Further, these companies increase dividends annually each year, enhancing the effective yield over time.', 'Three such companies that can help you generate passive income include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). I am bullish on each of these stocks due to their strong brands, predictable earnings, and steady, growing dividends.', 'Valued at $256 billion by market cap, Coca-Cola is among the most recognizable brands in the world. It is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of non-alcoholic beverages. In the last 20 years, Coca-Cola’s stock has returned 133% to shareholders. But after adjusting for dividends, total returns are closer to 323%. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has returned 538% after adjusting for dividends.', 'While Coca-Cola has underperformed the broader market, it has still outpaced inflation over the long term. Moreover, the stock is much less volatile than the S&P 500 Index, with a beta of less than 0.6. A beta of less than 1.0 suggests low relative volatility for a particular stock.', 'Despite its massive size, Coca-Cola increased its sales from $33 billion in 2020 to $43 billion in 2022. In 2023, its sales increased to $45.75 billion. Comparatively, operating income has risen from $9 billion in 2020 to nearly $11 billion in 2022 and $11.3 billion in 2023.', 'Coca-Cola pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $1.94 per share, indicating a forward yield of 3.3%. In the last 20 years, Coca-Cola has increased its dividends at an annual rate of 7.3%.', 'Coca-Cola continues to gain market share in the beverage segment and ended 2023 with free cash flow of $9.7 billion. Its payout ratio has ranged around 75%, providing it with enough room to strengthen the balance sheet, reinvest in capital expenditures, and increase its dividends.', 'Out of the 14 analysts tracking Coca-Cola, 10 recommend Buying, and four recommend Holding. There are no Sell recommendations for KO stock. The average KO stock price target is $65.79, indicating upside potential of 10.8% from current levels.', 'Valued at $229 billion by market cap, Pepsi is a direct competitor to Coca-Cola. Its portfolio of brands other than Pepsi includes Cheetos, Gatorade, Lay’s, and Mountain Dew, among others. Pepsi currently pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $5.06 per share, indicating a yield of 3%.', 'Moreover, the company has raised the payouts for 52 consecutive years, which is remarkable. In the last 20 years, Pepsi has grown its dividends by more than 10% annually.', 'In recent years, Pepsi has increased product prices to offset inflation, showcasing its pricing power. However, due to a sluggish macro environment, Pepsi expects sales to grow by just 4% year-over-year in 2024, lower than consensus estimates of 5.2%.', 'Out of the 16 analysts covering PEP stock, nine recommend a Buy, seven recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average Pepsi stock price target\xa0is $189.44, 13.9% above the current price.', 'The final dividend stock on my list is Procter & Gamble, valued at $370 billion. Operating in the branded consumer packaged goods segment, Procter & Gamble is a household name and operates in multiple verticals, such as beauty, healthcare, and family care, among others.', 'Similar to other companies, P&G is struggling with tepid consumer spending amid higher interest rates and inflation. Despite these headwinds, P&G saw its earnings grow by 16% in the October-to-December quarter due to cost savings and price hikes.', 'The company expects organic sales to grow between 4% and 5% in 2024, compared to a 7% increase in 2023. P&G’s focus on cost optimization should drive earnings and dividends higher from here.', 'P&G pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $3.76 per share, indicating a forward yield of 2.4%. These payouts have increased by 7.6% annually in the last 20 years.', 'Out of the 16 analysts covering PG stock, 10 recommend a Buy, six recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average PG stock price target\xa0is $167.93, 6.6% above the current price.', 'Passive income investors can consider investing in large-cap dividend stocks. In addition to the dividend yield, investors are also positioned to benefit from long-term capital gains.', 'Given the average yield of 2.8% for these three stocks, an investment of $5,000 in each of these dividend giants will help you earn $420 in annual dividends. In case the payouts increase by 7% each year, your dividends will double in the next 10 years.', 'Disclosure']"

The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% and reach $110 billion by 2033.

Moreover, the rise in government initiatives toward recycling waste is also contributing to the expansion of the market.', 'One of the major trends in the market is the adoption of smart recycling technologies. These technologies include sensitive systems and robotic waste separation. The rise in the demand for recycled materials will create new opportunities for companies across industries including construction, automotive, and packaging. Waste-to-energy conversion technologies such as anaerobic digestion and thermal treatment are gaining traction. These treatment technologies are expected to revolutionize the waste recycling landscape by generating energy from both non-recyclable and organic waste streams.', 'The United States is expected to grow significantly over the forecasted period. The growth can be attributed to increased awareness about environmental issues, strict regulations, government-led recycling initiatives, and the rising focus on sustainable development. On September 13, 2023, the US EPA announced $100 million in grants for recycling and waste management projects in the country for the first time in 30 years. The US EPA is targeting a rate of 50% recycling by 2030 in its National Recycling Strategy. The current recycling rate is nearly 32% in the country. However, the rate of recycling plastic is only around 5% in the US. 25 communities, selected by the EPA, will receive more than $70 million in grants to enhance their recycling facilities. The agency will offer an additional $32 million to states and territories to deploy their waste management plans. The grants approved for communities range from $500,000 to $4 million. These funds will support multiple projects, ranging from upgrading equipment to funding composting programs.', 'The rise in advanced recycling technologies and increasing adoption of circular economy principles are some other factors that are driving the growth of the recycling market.

However, the main driver for the enterprise as a candidate for stable dividend stocks is the underlying everyday necessity.', 'Just because a recession suddenly materializes doesn’t mean that we’ll stop using personal care products. Additionally, P&G carries the clear advantage of selling primarily low-cost products. If family budgets are going to be slashed, the focus will turn to the discretionary items: vacation plans, beverages from pricey coffee shops and streaming subscriptions that have gone dormant (except to ping your account every month).', 'Regarding passive income, P&G isn’t astonishingly generous with a forward yield of 2.39%.

And that panic later subsided into a gradual erosion of market value. However, after Target posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, TGT stock came alive.

The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to 10 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month. ', 'Over the past three decades, the average retirement age in America has increased by 3 years, from 62 to 65 for men, and from 59 to 62 for women. According to the US Social Security Administration, the full normal retirement age for anyone born after 1960 is now 67. In other words, Americans are now working longer and retiring later than ever. On top of this, Republicans, one of the leading parties in the US, are pressurizing the current government to increase the full retirement age from 67 to 69. They argue that since life expectancy in the US has increased, the retirement age should be raised as well — it’s only ""logical"" that they should be allowed to work longer.\xa0', ""Another argument that Republicans put forth is that the government's social security funds are depleting. Nikki Haley, the Republican presidential candidate, says that in the next ten years, the social security funds will drop significantly. The 2022 Social Security Trustees report backs Haley’s claims as it finds that due to low inflow (income received through payroll taxes) and high outflow (monthly benefit paid to retirees by the state) retirees will only be able to receive full Social Security benefits till 2034.\xa0"", 'If no legislative action is taken and Social Security Benefits are paid in full, after 2034, the trust funds would only be sufficient to pay 77% of full Social Security benefits. It’s an issue that demands immediate action and may be resolved if the government increases the retirement age. However, although increasing the retirement age will potentially save Social Security funds from complete depletion, potential retirees are expected to have mixed reactions.\xa0', 'On the one hand, retirees who want to work longer will be happy as an increase in retirement age will let them work more. On the other hand, retirees who pre-planned their retirement age and had everything aligned in their lives will feel lied to by the government. The latter holds more weightage; a large portion of expected retirees would not want to postpone their golden years into the 70s. Some retirees are also afraid of losing their flexible retirement option. Note that people aged 62 can currently opt for flexible retirement, but if the retirement age increases to 69 as the Republicans demand, the eligibility age for flexible retirement plans may also increase, resulting in reduced benefits for the retiree.\xa0', 'With the possibility of raising the retirement age on the table, the gravity and possible impact of the decision on millions of people in the US cannot be overlooked. According to the data posted by the US. Census Bureau in 2023, 77.5 million people in the US are over 60, which means 23.4% of the total population in the US will possibly retire in the next ten years.\xa0', 'However, despite the retirement age closing in, the population seems to be less prepared with their plans for a comfortable retirement. According to a 2023 survey by CNBC, 56% of Americans said they were not on track or making enough money to retire comfortably. The surging commodity prices have made it even more difficult to plan your life ahead and live accordingly. Perhaps the high cost of living and unpreparedness for retirement are two of the main reasons why the average retirement age is increasing over time. An efficient way to tackle both these problems is switching your state and moving to one that’s less expensive than the one you currently live in (See: 25 Best US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2500 a Month).\xa0', ""At the same time, it’s important to note that the cost of living varies from state to state and city to city in the US. According to Insider Monkey's cost of living index, Hawaii is the most expensive state to live in 2024, with an annual cost of living of over $103,000. On the other hand, Mississippi takes the spot for the state with the lowest annual cost of living, around $50,000. Hawaii is an exceptionally expensive state to live in mainly because it’s an island state with limited land for agriculture and manufacturing. Therefore, the state heavily relies on imported consumer goods and food, which incurs shipping costs and makes the basic goods expensive.\xa0"", 'Commodity prices are not the only costs that have been fluctuating in the US; healthcare expenses have been on the rise for the past couple of decades as well. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services report, the US healthcare spending grew 4.1% in 2022, reaching $4.5 trillion or $13,493 per capita. Furthermore, from 2022- 2031, national healthcare expenditure will rise even more, with an average growth rate of 5.4%. As you age, you can expect to pay more for the same drug prescriptions and medical services compared to today. The same is the case with other commodities and services.\xa0', 'Put simply, you have to keep inflation in mind and save more than you currently spend so you can cover your future living costs comfortably. Many prospective retirees in the U.S. rely on Social Security for retirement funds, but since that’s already running out, now is a good time to consider other retirement plans that will allow you to live your golden years comfortably and luxuriously. You may look into private retirement savings plans such as 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which are retirement savings accounts where you can save and invest without getting taxed. The 401(k) plan is given by most employers in America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it was the most common private retirement savings plan, with 34.6% of the individuals having it in 2020.\xa0', 'Some major companies with potentially prosperous IRAs are Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.B) and Axa SA (EPA: CS). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is a holding company, aiming to cross the trillion-dollar mark and join the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) also has high stakes in some giant companies like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', 'Speaking of investments, Legal & General Group PLC (LON: LGEN) is the UK’s leading financial service company with several investment plans, such as investments in stocks and pension pots. More importantly, Legal & General Group PLC (LON: LGEN) also has investment plans in retirement savings accounts for retirees and those approaching retirement. Legal & General Retirement America (LGRA) by Legal & General (LON: LGEN) was established in the US in 2015 and secured the retirement of over 27,000 annuitants in 2023.\xa0', 'Aging comes with an increased need for healthcare services. According to the American Psychology Association, approximately 92% of older people develop at least one chronic disease, and 77% suffer from two or more. If out-of-pocket costs for healthcare are not affordable, older adults are more likely to make significant compromises on their health. Fortunately, the U.S. is home to some of the top insurance companies. For example, the UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) has several group Medicare Advantage plans catering to the unique needs of retirees. The AARP Medicare Supplement plans by UnitedHealthcare (NYSE: UNH) will cover expenses that are not covered by the federal government’s Original Medicare. UnitedHealthcare (NYSE: UNH) also allows retirees to transition to different Medicare plans through their exchange model if the current one doesn’t suit them.', 'That said, shifting states and relocating as you start to reach retirement age is perhaps one of the most efficient ways to save money and live comfortably during your golden years.', ""With that said, let's head over to the list of the best places in the US to retire on a budget of $5,000 a month."", '25 best places in the US to retire on $5000 a month', 'To compile the list of 25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month, we have used several sources such as Yahoo Finance, Travel & Leisure, US News, and Nasdaq, to name a few.
