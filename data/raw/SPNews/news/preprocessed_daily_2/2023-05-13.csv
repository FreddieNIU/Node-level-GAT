For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Pfizer: A dividend powerhouse with strong financial health scorePharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a household name, but did you know it’s also a dividend powerhouse? The company’s payout stands at a fantastic 4.3%, and it has raised its dividend annually for the last dozen years in a row. Its InvestingPro financial health score is solid at 3.61, largely thanks to robust profits and a nice cash flow that should keep those dividends coming. Shares are down some 27% for the year to $37.34, and analysts expect a rise of more than 35% from here. So it may be time for investors of all kinds - but especially dividend investors - to swoop in and pick up some Pfizer.Robert Half International's share buybacksStaffing name Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI) pays a solid 2.9% dividend yield, and has upped its payout for the past 19 straight years — which certainly gives its dividend investors peace of mind. Not only is its dividend high, but it has also been returning cash to shareholders by aggressively buying back shares. Its profits and cash flow are both exceptional, giving it a very nice 3.06 InvestingPro financial health score, and analysts figure it has more than 30% upside from current levels. Shares are down 9.1% for the year to $66.87.Aflac's financial health supported by price momentum and cash flowAflac (NYSE:AFL), the insurance giant, has a proven track record of 39 consecutive years of dividend bumps, earning it the coveted title of ""dividend aristocrat."" It also sports a generous dividend payout of 2.5%, and Wall Street analysts price targets put stock upside at an impressive 15%. Aflac's respectable InvestingPro financial health score, moreover, is 2.83 thanks to its exceptional price momentum and strong cash flow. Shares have slipped some 8% year to date to $66.10.Story continuesRegions Financial's potential 30% upsideRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) has raised its dividend payout annually for the past decade, and the current dividend payout of 5.1% is particularly impressive. The bank boasts a robust financial health score of 2.94, largely thanks to its lofty profits — and, per both fair value estimates and analyst projections, the stock is undervalued and could see a surge of at least 30%. Shares are down 27% for the year to $15.74, offering a chance to get in at a great price.Texas Instruments: Growth and dividends in the same stockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has ratcheted up its dividend payout for 19 years in a row, and this reliable payout is a juicy 3%, adding to the company's appeal. On top of that, the chipmaker’s InvestingPro fair value gives the stock significant upside, and the company boasts a solid InvestingPro financial health score of 2.89, in large part due to its mouth-watering profits and strong cash flow.

7,d0c04723-5975-3b76-801e-adc63bc0bb32,UNM,2023-05-13,Why Unum (UNM) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unum-unm-great-dividend-154503443.html,1683906303,STORY,['UNM'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusHeadquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 6.02% so far this year. The insurance company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.03%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.49% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 20%. This means it paid out 20% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, UNM expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.06 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 13.69%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, a tough operating backdrop is a major headwind. Yet, the company will keep benefiting from new business servicing wins, synergies from strategic buyouts, global footprint, and strong balance sheet and liquidity positions.Elevated operating expenses are expected to continue to hurt State Street’s bottom line, despite a marginal decline in the same in 2022 driven by cost-saving efforts. The total non-interest expenses increased in the first quarter of 2023.While STT has successfully managed to control expenses through high-cost location workforce reduction and restructuring efforts, overall costs are likely to remain elevated owing to higher Information systems and communications expenses. Further, inflationary pressure and the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchise will weigh on the expenses. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses suggest a CAGR of 4.6% by 2025.State Street’s largest source of revenues is fee income, which constituted more than 75% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023.

However, continued higher spending on the deployment of 5G networking, gaining from the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, is a catalyst. The growing need for fast connections, low latency and efficient battery life in wirelessly connected devices has been driving the demand for WiFI-enabled hotspots. The democratization of 5G smartphones has been a tailwind for the industry players. These factors have bolstered the demand for radio-frequency semiconductor solutions provided by industry players like Skyworks Solutions SWKS and Qorvo QRVO.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide radio frequency solutions, front-end modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers, and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in congested RF spectrum. They serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive, and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.4 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF IndustryAccelerated 5G Deployment is a Tailwind: The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications hold promise for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which are expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. Further, growing demand for WiFi hotspots, as the number of wirelessly connected devices increases in households, is enhancing industry prospects. Cisco forecasts that number of hotspots worldwide will reach 600 million in 2023.Innovation is Opening up Business Avenues: The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars, and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. Notably, RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by consequently digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense. The diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. Moreover, the evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. Further, the rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers. The industry participants are looking to address these challenges with a robust range of antenna-plexer portfolios utilizing the BAW technology.Growing Adoption of Electric Vehicles Aids Prospect: Industry players are gaining from the increasing inclusion of their products in electric vehicles (EVs). The market for EVs is expected to expand fourfold by 2027.Supply-Chain and Higher Commodity Costs to Hinder Prospects: The industry players are reeling under the impacts of supply-chain constraints, as well as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on PVH's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for PVH How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PVH is:4.0% = US$200m ÷ US$5.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.PVH's Earnings Growth And 4.0% ROEAs you can see, PVH's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 19%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 5.9% seen by PVH over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesHowever, when we compared PVH's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 15% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PVH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is PVH Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?PVH's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 4.9% (or a retention ratio of 95%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, PVH has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 1.4% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about PVH. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

The company’s Power of Three ×2 growth strategy bodes well. The company has been capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement, which is expected to boost its performance.Driven by these factors, lululemon reported the 11th straight quarter of an earnings surprise in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, while sales beat estimates for the fourth straight quarter. The top and bottom lines also grew year over year on the back of continued business momentum. Results outpaced our estimate in the quarter. Comps growth was aided by robust traffic trends in stores and e-commerce. On a three-year CAGR basis, traffic was up 7% in stores and more than 45% in e-commerce.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company echoes a positive sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lululemon’s fiscal 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 15.7% and 14%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.However, management’s commentary on elevated inventory levels at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter has hurt sentiment. lululemon has been grappling with soft margins due to elevated costs and higher SG&amp;A expenses.The stock has gained 17.7% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 4.4%. The stock also compared favorably with the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 7.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 8.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Driving Growthlululemon is poised to benefit from a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales, driven by an increase in store traffic, as consumers returned to stores for shopping. Management highlighted that store productivity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 continued to trend above the 2019 level. The company has been focused on investments to enhance its in-store experience. It is leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including the buy online pickup in store and ship from store.lululemon has implemented several strategies to improve its guest experience and reduce wait time. These include virtual waitlist, mobile point of sale and appointment shopping. These functionalities enable reducing the time of waiting in line to enter the store and allow customers to complete transactions like returns, exchanges and purchase of gift cards without entering the store. It continues to expand its store base.In first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects to open five to 10 net new company-operated stores. Management expects to open 45-50 net new company-operated stores in fiscal 2023, along with the completion of 25 co-located remodels. The total store openings in fiscal 2023 will imply a square footage increase in the low-double digits. Store openings in fiscal 2023 are likely to include 30-35 in the international markets, with the majority of these planned to be opened in China.lululemon expects to capture the growing online demand and ensure a robust shopping experience through accelerated e-commerce investments. It has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities.Encouraged by robust gains from the pandemic-led athleisure boom, lululemon announced its Power of Three ×2 growth strategy. The move is likely to double its revenues from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026. The plan focuses on three key growth drivers, including product innovation, guest experience and market expansion.The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, the women’s business and North America operations are anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China and Europe markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, the total net revenue CAGR is expected to be 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, the company believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeAlthough lululemon reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter results, management’s commentary on elevated inventory levels at the end of the quarter hurt investors’ sentiment. lululemon’s inventory grew 49.8% to $1,447.4 million at the end of fiscal 2022. This included a $62.9-million provision against the inventory related to lululemon Studio, which reduced the inventory growth rate by seven percentage points.The company noted that the off-season made up for about 45% of its inventory. In fiscal 2023, management expects inventory growth to moderate, while maintaining its full-price selling model and remaining well-positioned to fulfill guest demand. lululemon expects the inventory growth rate at the end of the fiscal first quarter to increase 30-35% from the last year. It also expects inventory growth to be in line with sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks to consider are Crocs Inc.

In fact, if they do it’s important to stay away from the worst dividend stocks for rising rates.Sure, plenty of contrarian investors believe that the Fed is on the verge of “pivoting” on interest rates. First, by easing on rate hikes. Then, by lowering rates back down. However, it’s not for certain whether the Fed will pivot, merely on the sign of cooling inflation, or even if/when a recession happens. With the rate of inflation still “sticky,” and well above the central bank’s own target of 2% per year, the Fed may deem it necessary to keep raising rates, no matter the near-term consequences. This could severely hurt stocks in this category, in two ways.First, the dividend stocks and interest rates correlation is very high with these names. An increase in interest rates leads to a similar decline in their valuation. Second, there are high-yielders whose fundamentals could be worsened by higher rates. Until the Fed changes its tune, avoid these seven worst dividend stocks for rising rates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAGNCAGNC Investment$9.50MPWMedical Properties Trust$8.57PACWPacWest Bancorp$5.97SLGSL Green Realty$22.00STWDStarwood Property Trust$16.76USBUS Bancorp$29.74UWMCUWM Holdings45.85AGNC Investment (AGNC)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinAGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) is one of the better-known real estate investment trusts that invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities. With a high dividend yield (15.21%) and monthly payouts, AGNC may seem at first like a great opportunity for income-focused investors. However, the rising rate environment has taken a toll on AGNC stock, in two ways. First, as higher rates have led to portfolio losses, the stock has fallen from around $15 to just under $9.50 per share since the start of 2022. Second, higher rates have squeezed the spread between AGNC’s borrowing costs and the interest income generated from its portfolio.Story continuesHigher rates will keep this mortgage REIT under pressure, due to further portfolio write-downs. Although it has not lowered its payout since 2020, AGNC may also end up becoming a dividend cutter once again, as higher rates squeeze its net income once again.Medical Properties Trust (MPW)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is one of the biggest dividend trap stocks currently out there. This healthcare REIT is another name that has become popular amongst contrarians, who believe that its low valuation and high dividend yield (13.5%) more than makes up for an elevated level of risk.In addition, some commentators have argued that concerns over rate hike risks are overblown with MPW stock. Nevertheless, these counter-arguments have yet to sway the market’s view on this REIT. Even as only a portion of its fixed rate debt matures (and therefore needs to be refinanced at higher rates) in the near-term, this could still have an impact. MPW could remain at risk of having to unload assets at unfavorable prices. Reduced cash flow could result in a much-anticipated dividend cut finally happening. With so much still up in the air, stay away.PacWest Bancorp (PACW)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockBanks are some of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates. Mostly, because higher rates have decreased the market value of loans/securities made/purchased back when rates were significantly lower. Yet among these names, PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) is one of the most vulnerable due to this factor.Many investors hold this view, including InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung. That’s not to say, though, that this PacWest is doomed to become the next First Republic (OTCMKTS:FRCB). So far in May, PacWest has been scrambling to save itself. For instance, the regional bank has been exploring a sale for the whole bank, or of some of its assets. That’s not all. PACW has also slashed its quarterly dividend from 25 cents to just a penny. Now lacking a high-yield, yet still at high risk of shareholder experience a FRCB-style total wipeout, resist the urge to roll the dice with this situation.SL Green Realty (SLG)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockRising rates have made investors bearish on REITs in general, but the persistence of the “work from home” trend has made them especially bearish about office building REITs like SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG). In fact, this REIT, which owns a portfolio of office buildings in New York City, hasn’t just fallen out of favor.As real estate publication The Real Deal recently detailed, SLG stock has become the most heavily-shorted major office REIT, with 15.5% of its outstanding float sold short. There’s a good reason as to why the short trade has become crowded with SL Green. More heavily leveraged than its peers, and with swaps on its variable rate debt soon expiring, SLG’s borrowing costs could skyrocket as it refinances at higher rates. This puts its dividend (14.4% forward yield) under threat. Higher rates and vacancy issues also stand to further lower SLG’s underlying value.Starwood Property Trust (STWD)earningsSource: ShutterstockMuch like SL Green Realty, Starwood Property Trust (NYSE:STWD) is another of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates that has become a popular short-seller target. According to Bloomberg, STWD stock, along with Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT), have become some of the most heavily-shorted mortgage REIT stocks in recent months. Current trends in office space demand back up the bear case. As remote working trends keep vacancy rates high, defaults among commercial mortgage securities may be poised to rise as well.Sure, 99% of Starwood’s portfolio consists of floating rate loans. This leaves it not vulnerable to rising rates. In fact, higher rates could increase STWD’s net interest margin. That said, higher rates have been a factor in rising commercial mortgage defaults. Hence, a further rise could cause additional defaults, leading to asset write-downs that put pressure on STWD, outweighing its juicy 11.5% forward dividend.US Bancorp (USB)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockIt’s not just small, regional banks that are too risky to touch in today’s environment. US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), a larger, more established financial institution, is in a precarious situation right now. At least, that’s the view of Holdco Asset Management.Holdco, which has shorted USB stock, issued a “short report” on it back on April 17. In a nutshell, Holdco’s argument is that, when you account for unrealized loan losses (caused by rising interest rates), US Bancorp has become undercapitalized. Due to regulatory quirks, it has managed to avoid including these losses when calculating its capital ratios, but soon may have to do so.If this happens, USB may have to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. This issue could also affect USB’s ability to maintain its current high dividend (6.25%). With this, it may just well be one of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates.UWM Holdings (UWMC)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockShares in wholesale mortgage lender UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC) have been on the rise in recent months. Even as the housing slowdown continues, a strong earnings report in March, plus renewed hopes of a housing recovery, have helped to renew bullishness.However, this renewed bullishness for UWMC stock could prove to be premature in hindsight. As mortgage rates move higher in tandem with the Fed’s latest rate hikes, the housing downtown could worsen before it improves. The impact of higher rates (for example, higher unemployment) could lead to a further worsening of the housing market. As the downturn continues, UWM’s earnings stand to remain depressed. This calls into question its ability to maintain its 6.86% forward dividend yield. Assuming that this stock’s dividend cut risk will rise again if rates inch higher, consider UWMC one of the dividend stocks to sell before the next rate hike.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.The unprecedented collections recovery in plasma volumes, the performance of hemostasis management and vascular closure and operational excellence toward greater productivity fueled Haemonetics’ strong performance throughout fiscal 2023.Segments in DetailAt Plasma, revenues of $131.2 million (accounting for 43.1% of the total revenues) rose 29.8% year over year (up 31.2% on an organic basis) in the reported quarter.Revenues at Blood Center (22.1%) fell 8.1% (down 3.7% on an organic basis) to $67.2 million.Hospital revenues (33.1%) rose 17.6% (up 19.3% on an organic basis) to $100.8 million. primarily driven by growth in Vascular Closure and Hemostasis Management.Service revenues (1.7%) increased 2.9% (up 6.8% on an organic basis) to $5.2 million.MarginsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company-adjusted gross margin was 51.8%, down 180 basis points (bps) year over year. The primary drivers of the decrease were inflationary pressures on global manufacturing and the supply chain, increased depreciation expenses and foreign exchange partially offset by volume and price benefits.Story continuesCompany-adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were $103.6 million, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by performance-based compensations, investments in sales and marketing and R&amp;D, partially offset by a decrease in freight costs and Operational Excellence Program savings.The company-adjusted operating income was $53.9 million in the quarter under discussion, up 15.8% year over year. The adjusted operating margin was 17.7%, up 10 bps from the year-ago quarter.Financial PositionHaemonetics exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $284.5 million compared with $259.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.29.Our TakeHaemonetics ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The robust volume growth and price benefits in the Plasma business drove the quarter’s top line.Revenues from HAE’s hospital business came in at $100 million for the first time, which is highly appreciated. The Vascular Closure business favorably contributing toward operating margins also seems promising.For fiscal 2023, Haemonetics generated $26 million in gross savings from its operational excellence program, with cumulative gross savings slightly ahead of the plan. The company continues to prioritize investments in high-impact and high-value projects, with plans to amplify the domestic production of NexSys PCS devices to support plasma customer growth requirements.However, the year-over-year decline to flat revenue guidance in HAE’s Blood Center business is discouraging. The pacing of revenues in this business is backend loaded with an unfavorable order timing impact in the first half of the year compared with fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHaemonetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

But since the onset of the regional banking uncertainty following the Silicon Valley Bank failure in early March, Walmart shares have been notable outperformers, up +4.9% in that period vs. an +0.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index and an -8.3% decline for Target shares.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart and Target shares vs. the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress.’Walmart and Target are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Walmart will report on Thursday, May 18th, and Target will report on Wednesday, May 17th, with both quarterly reports coming before the market’s open. Walmart’s quarterly EPS expectations coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 per share up by a penny over the past two months and unchanged over the past month. Unlike Walmart, there has been some pressure on Target estimates, with several analysts pointing to near-term challenges for the company.One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart’s bigger grocery business, which gives its results greater stability given the ‘staply’ nature of that otherwise low-margin business. That said, groceries drive foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned ‘trade down’ phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Analysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart’s business on the back of higher average selling prices, foot traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last time on February 21st. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Story continuesBoth companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic went into the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results, for which they were punished by the market. While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job of adjusting to the new environment compared to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 20 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 20 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 20 retailers that have reported are up +11% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 70% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings and revenue expectations.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne recurring theme in the Q1 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution. Given this development, one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q1, and that’s what these results will reconfirm.Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 10th, we now have Q1 earnings from 459 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.8% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -4% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, with 77.6% beating EPS estimates and 74.9% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.7%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 300 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Walmart and Target reports, this week’s docket includes Home Depot, TJX Cos, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, and Deere &amp; Company.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 459 index members in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the 459 index members that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -4.1% on +4.3% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get to down earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchActual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne notable recent development on the earnings front, which I flagged in the weekly Earnings Trends report in greater detail, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings have increased +0.3% as a whole and +0.6%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Analyzing Recent Earnings Estimate Revisions  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

21,a612aec1-42af-3033-8e97-c59f695cdadf,WMT,2023-05-13,The Walmart Gift Card Class Action Form Asks for Your Social Security Number — Is It a Scam?,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-gift-card-class-action-145348225.html,1683903228,STORY,['WMT'],"[Sundry Photography / Getty ImagesOne of the first rules of avoiding scams is to not give out your Social Security number to anyone you don’t know and trust — especially on the internet. But that’s what victims of a Walmart gift card scam are being asked to do in order to recoup the money they lost.Discover: Facebook Marketplace Scams To Watch Out For in 2023Learn: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchA notice on the kccsecure.com website, which features the U.S. Department of Justice seal, and is listed on their site, provides a “Petition for Remission” that allows scam victims to get back gift card money that was frozen last decade after Walmart noticed a pattern of fraud. To get the money, one of the requirements is that you provide your Social Security number.In this case, you don’t need to worry about your SSN getting into the wrong hands. The Petition for Remission site directly addresses why you are required to provide your Social Security number in its FAQ section, which says the following:“If your petition is approved, it must be reviewed by the Treasury Offset Program to verify that you do not owe any money to the federal government or certain state debts. If you owe money, your payment will be used to pay your debt. If your payment is more than the amount you owe, you will get the remainder. Your Social Security Number will not be shared or used for any other purpose.”Victims of the scam will share nearly $4 million in remission payments as a result of the gift card scam. According to the petition website, Walmart first noticed the gift card scams in 2015 when “unknown fraudsters” directed victims to buy Walmart gift cards with values that typically ranged from $500 and $1,000.“Between April 2016 and July 2017, Walmart froze the balances of the gift cards that were connected to this suspected fraud before the balances could be transferred to the fraudsters,” the site said. “Based on this conduct…the United States Attorney’s Office filed a Verified Complaint for Forfeiture against $3,958,060.84 in United States currency (22-USS-000172), representing the gift card balances frozen by Walmart.”Story continuesIn layman’s terms, that means the Justice Department filed a lawsuit for the forfeiture of the nearly $4 million in gift card balances frozen by Walmart and the money is now available for compensation payments. The DOJ also said in a notice updated last month that a pair of individuals pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges tied to the Walmart gift card schemes, which involved hundreds of fraud victims from across the United States.You might be eligible for a remission payment if, at the direction of an unknown fraudster, you bought and sent a Walmart Gift Card between April 1, 2016, and July 31, 2017, and were the victim of fraud. To apply, you must file the Petition of Remission by July 14, 2023. The acceptance of petitions postmarked after this date will be subject to the Justice Department’s discretion.Payments will be based only on the amount loaded onto the Walmart gift card, minus any recoveries you might have received from a bank or other source. According to the petition site, your payment amount “will likely be less than the amount you lost.” You also can’t recover collateral expenses such as money transfer fees, incidental losses or transfers sent through other companies.Take Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Zelle Scams on Facebook Marketplace: How To Recognize and Avoid ThemIf you don’t have or don’t remember your Walmart gift card number, you can still submit a petition, but you’ll need to provide other details about the transaction that can help validate the transfer. Payments won’t be issued until after the filing period has ended and all submitted petitions have been reviewed for eligibility.You can file a Petition for Remission online at the case website (www.walmartgiftcardremission.com) or mail it to this address:Walmart Gift Card Remission Claims AdministratorP.O.

TJX is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on May 17. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11,823 million, suggesting an increase of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 71 cents per share. The projection indicates growth of 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings.The TJX Companies has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6%, on average.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe TJX Companies, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The TJX Companies, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderTJX has been gaining from strength in the Marmaxx segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, U.S. comp store sales grew 7% in Marmaxx, buoyed by solid apparel and accessories categories’ sales. Customer traffic remained the key driver behind comp store sales growth, with the average basket size also increasing. We believe that the continuation of these trends is likely to have aided the company’s overall sales in the quarter under review. However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales for the past few quarters.The TJX Companies has been benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Further, with an increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business.These upsides bode well for the quarter to be reported. For the first quarter, comp store sales are expected to have risen 2-3% and consolidated sales are expected to have increased 3-4% to the $11.7-$11.8 billion band.Apart from this, The TJX Companies has been seeing growth in its pretax profit margin. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, management anticipates a pretax profit margin in the range of 9.2-9.5%, which suggests an increase from the 7.5% reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.However, the company has also been witnessing incremental wage costs and supply-chain costs. On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects high wage and supply-chain costs to remain hurdles in fiscal 2024, which may have persisted in the first quarter as well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for The TJX Companies this time.

Also, focus on gaming concession in Macau bodes well. However, a decline in traffic from pre-pandemic levels is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthWynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across F&amp;B and retail. During the quarter, non-gaming revenues increased 21% year over year to $50.9 million. The company emphasizes on introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and strong shareholder returns. Attributes such as strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power and a robust programming calendar bode well.WYNN is benefiting from sound demand for sports betting. It collaborated with several engaging content creators to develop unique sports-themed program. During the first quarter of 2023, the company launched a retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor. Following the launch, the company reported a 20 increase in sign-ups (year-to-date) to its Wynn Rewards loyalty program. The company anticipates solid revenue generation on the back of new product features and a unique marketing campaign.Wynn Resorts derives a solid share of revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the company is confident about prospects in Macau. The worst seems to be over for the gaming industry in Macau as China economy is slowly gaining momentum. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Wynn Resorts (Macau) entered into a 10-year agreement with the Macau government for the renewal of its gaming concession, covering Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai. For 2023, the company expects capex related to concession commitments in the range of $50-$220 million. The company is of the opinion that the proposed capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.The emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently reached an agreement to develop a multibillion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. This move marks Wynn Resorts’ foray into a new market. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region. During the first quarter of 2023, the company progressed with respect to the project design. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development.In the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have gained 61.3% compared with the industry’s 29.6% growth.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsAlthough the company reported solid recovery in Macau and Las Vegas regions in the first quarter, a decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern. During the quarter, the company witnessed soft international visitation particularly from Europe and Latin America. Also, disruptions related to the renovation-related closures of Wynn Macau's East casino, added to the downside.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD and Crocs, Inc. CROX.MGM Resorts sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 81%, on average. The stock has increased 17.7% in the past year.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusBased in New York, MetLife (MET) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -29.21%. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.06%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.14% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.28%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 32%, which means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.97 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 16.35%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NWSA witnessed a decline in revenues across all its segments except Book Publishing and Dow Jones.Shares of this diversified media and information services company have lost 6.2% in the past one year against the industry’s gain of 1.5%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNews Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | News Corporation QuoteQuarterly DetailsNews Corporation delivered adjusted quarterly earnings of 9 cents a share. The bottom-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents but plunged 43.7% from adjusted earnings of 16 cents reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable period.Total revenues of $2,447 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,398 million but dipped 2% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was primarily due to a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due to continued challenging housing market conditions in the United States and Australia. The downside was partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics and higher revenues at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Revenues were flat year over year.Total EBITDA decreased 11% to $320 million, primarily due to lower revenues, higher costs at the Dow Jones segment and a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The results also include $7 million of costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust as well as the fees related to the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 15%.Story continuesSegment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment declined 13% to $363 million, induced by a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues decreased 10%.Revenues in Move fell 17% to $141 million primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 79% of total Move revenues, decreased 23% to $33 million. The decline was due to the continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher household interest rates, which has led to lower lead and transaction volumes. The referral model generated 23% of total Move revenues in the quarter compared with 28% in the prior year. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites declined 24% year over year to 72 million. Lead volume declined 30%.Revenues at REA Group decreased 10% to $222 million because of a $13 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower Australian residential revenues and lower financial services revenues. Australian national residential buy listing volumes declined 12% year over year, with listings in Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $477 million, down 3% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 5%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE were driven by a rise in both volume and pricing, partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 20% in the prior year.Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were more than 4.5 million, reflecting a 6% increase from the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo. Broadcast subscriber churn improved to 12.3% from 14.3% in the prior year. Broadcast average revenue per user for the quarter increased 2% year over year to A$84 (US$57).Revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 9% year over year to $529 million. This includes $27 million and $19 million contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted Revenues at the Dow Jones segment were flat from the prior year. Digital revenues at Dow Jones represented 79% of total revenues compared with 76% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues increased 13% to $49 million, which includes the contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Circulation revenues declined 1%, primarily due to lower print volume and lower revenues from IBD, which was partially offset by the continued growth in digital-only subscriptions. Professional information business revenues grew 38%, primarily driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products. Revenues from the Risk &amp; Compliance products grew 16%, which includes a 3% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 69% of circulation revenues  compared with 68% in the prior year.Advertising revenues decreased 14% to $14 million, primarily due to 17% and 8% declines in digital and print advertising revenues, respectively. The decline was due to a continued weakness in the technology and finance categories. Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues compared with 62% in the prior year.During the third quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached more than 5.1 million, up 6% from the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions rose 10%. Total subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 5% to nearly 3.9 million average subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 9% to 3.3 million average subscriptions and represented 85% of total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $515 million, flat year over year from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level, mainly due to higher sales in Christian books. Adjusted Revenues increased 2%. Digital sales declined 3% from the prior year due to lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Consumer revenues and were in line with the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 60% of total revenues in the quarter.Segment EBITDA for the quarter decreased 9% to $6 million, due to the ongoing supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures on manufacturing, freight and distribution costs. The decline was partially offset by lower employee costs. These pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 7%.Revenues in the News Media segment dipped 3% to $563 million. Within the segment, revenues at News Corporation Australia and News UK decreased 5% and 4%, respectively, as both were impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations.

Adjusted Revenues for the segment increased 4%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 4% due to lower print volumes and an 8% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 5% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 7% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter compared with 35% in the prior year and represented 34% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads.

Recently, Microsoft Corp. Co-Founder Bill Gates sat down with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for an interview, but the questions were generated entirely by an AI chatbot. The result was a candid conversation that shed light on Gates’s past experiences and regrets.Don't Miss: Why Jason Calacanis and Other Silicon Valley Elites Are Betting On This Startups Vision For Re-Uniting American FamiliesIn a YouTube video posted by Sunak’s office earlier this year, Gates was asked by the British leader, reading an AI-generated question, what advice he would give his younger self if he could go back in time. Gates’s response? “I was kind of overly intense. I didn’t believe in weekends. I didn’t believe in vacation.” He was the definition of a workaholic.While Gates’s early intensity may have helped him build Microsoft into a multibillion-dollar tech giant, he admits it also made him socially awkward as a leader. He acknowledged being a difficult boss, which caused him to pass on hiring talented people who didn’t fit in with his intense atmosphere.Gates has admitted to being demanding and sometimes speaking harshly to employees, but he explained that it was a reflection of the high standards he held for himself and everyone else. As Microsoft grew, Gates learned to lighten up and think about the long-term effects of his leadership style. Although he wished he realized the importance a little sooner.Gates would advise his younger self to read a lot and explore the developing world, and he has been very open about his introversion and social ineptitude as a young man.A chatbot was able to pose a thought-provoking question, albeit one that may have been somewhat clichéd.To stay updated with top startup news &amp; investments, sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterThis raises the question: If an AI chatbot can generate questions that elicit candid responses from a billionaire tech giant like Gates, what else can AI do? Could AI chatbots eventually become the new interviewers and journalists, delving deeper into people’s experiences than any human interviewer could?Story continuesThe Growth of AIFrom writers to interviewers, AI is quickly taking the center stage. ChatGPT took the world by storm with its conversational and intelligent AI-based responses. Now, Google and Microsoft are spending tens of billions of dollars racing to implement these features into their new and existing products. This has prompted hundreds of startups to implement the technology in a unique and innovative manner. Startups like AtomBeam are using AI to compact data by up to 75% drastically increasing bandwidth for most devices.

48,8a2ff8b1-c8a6-3e68-91d7-7e7aafbf3dc6,MSFT,2023-05-13,AI Comes To Meta's Rescue,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-comes-metas-rescue-183247379.html,1683916367,STORY,"['META', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'PINS']","[Meta Platforms (NASDSAQ: META) is still very much devoted to developing a virtual reality, with its latest quarterly earnings report showing it is not giving up on the metaverse it decided to build its future on. By the looks of it, AI is exactly what Meta needed to somehwat ease its investors' concerns.The Unveiling Of AI testing PlaygroundOn Thursday, Meta revealed the AI Sandbox that will help advertisers build campaigns and improve their results, as well as an updated Meta Advantage portfolio of automated tools that advertisers can use to enhance their campaigns. These efforts are aimed at helping advertisers both save time and improve the results of their efforts. They are also Meta’s latest effort to show investors that costly AI efforts justify their hefty costs.Outlook That Reflects The Weight Of AI EffortsDuring the company’s latest earnings call, CFO Susan Li guided for the full year capital expenditure to be in the range between $30 billion and $33 billion as Meta continues to build its AI capacity.Positive Results Showed A Strong QuarterFor its first quarter, Meta succeeded to beat analyst expectations as it posted YoY revenue growth for the first time in three quarters.Following Through Is Not An Easy TaskConcerns are growing that the metaverse efforts are draining valuable resources that exceed $10 billion a year, without any tangible benefits on the horizon. But by changing the company name to the name of the product, backing out stopped being an option so Meta can only follow through what Zuckerberg envisioned and that is not only to create the metaverse, but for the company to also become a leader in AI research along the way, facing off Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).Microsoft Is Leading The Way To A New AI EraMicrosoft has its eyes set on not only winning the AI wars but also on obtaining the search engine crown. Just a few months ago, Microsoft unveiled its co-pilot for web search, the AI-powered Bing and Edge. During its latest earnings call, the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, promised to reinvent the future of online search, the largest category of software in the world. Despite the company's long-standing partnership with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft even went further by joining forces with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) to develop AI semiconductor chips that could challenge Nvidia’s dominance.Story continuesGoogle’s ResponseAlphabet, whose Google is known as the “search king” has added AI in its core product attempt to create some kind of excitement that Microsoft received when it integrated its AI-powered chatbot to Bing. During Google’s annual conference that took place on Wednesday, Alphabet revealed a revamped version of its search engine named the Search Generative Experience. With this move, Alphabet can offer crafted responses to open-ended queries while keeping its recognizable links to the Web, with the search king clearly showing that Google will respond to Microsoft’s AI challenge.Despite A Strong Quarter, Meta Is Facing Tough TimesIn order to reach Zuckerberg’s desired destination without the scenario of staying the metaverse course on a sinking ship, the weakening online ad market made it obvious that Meta will need more revenue sources for its journey. Young users are fleeing the platform and legislation is working to put a stop on its revenue model based on vacuuming up and selling the gathered user data. In its past life as Facebook, the company faced severe criticism in this regard. Unlike Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) who remained loyal to its inspirational identity, Facebook’s moral grounds were questioned as it failed to take action in stopping hate speech, not to mention the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Social media has received so much backlash from all sides, and Pinterest is one of those rare platforms that succeeded to stay out of it. Although Pinterest is paying the price in terms of lagging in terms of monetization and profitability, its CEO is willing to pay the costs of creating an algorithm and consequently, a business model, that is built around the concept of making people feel better, as opposed to the current one that thrives on endorsing the bad sides of the human nature. Moral and ethics are not the kind of concept that Meta’s CEO was ever linked to. Although Pinterest still needs to prove that business can be done in a way that makes the world a better place, the platform did receive the multiannual support from Amazon who is more than capable to help it make that part of the equation happen, while Meta’s supporters are getting increasingly concerned.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), BP p.l.c. (BP) and Zoetis Inc. (ZTS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares largely tracked the Zacks Tech sector this year, but the stock hasn't looked back since the very strong Q1 earnings release on April 25th. As a result, Microsoft share now up +28.4% this year vs. +22% for the Zacks Tech sector and the +8.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index.  The company is benefitting from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues increased due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft is also seen as having a better offering on the artificial intelligence (AI) front than rival Alphabet. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses.Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. However, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of BP have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+24.4% vs. +10.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. The company boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully. Story continuesBP expects $2-$3 billion of divestment and other proceeds in 2023. Before reporting its June-quarter results, the integrated energy major is willing to complete an additional $1.75 billion in share buy-backs. Also, BP reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings resulting from an increase in oil-equivalent production volumes.However, the energy giant’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing exploration expenses have been affecting the company’s income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Zoetis shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.8%). The company’s innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products maintain momentum for the company.The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth.However, Zoetis had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Although the constraints have eased out, a similar situation will impact growth. Stiff competition from animal health business wings of Merck and Bayer remains a woe.(You can read the full research report on Zoetis here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc.

However, high operating costs remain concerning.CNA Financial (CNA) Banks on Solid Premiums Amid High CostsPer the Zacks analyst, CNA Financial is set to grow on solid Specialty, Commercial and International segment, which will drive improvement in net premiums. However, high costs remain a concern.New UpgradesGrowing Customer Base &amp; Partnerships Aid ServiceNow (NOW)Per the Zacks analyst, ServiceNow benefits from rising adoption of its workflows from companies undergoing digital transformation.

The biggest tidbit of gossip was that Buffett considers Apple to be the best business that they own. Additionally, he said Berkshire was not intending on buying out Occidental Petroleum.But what if, as an investor, you wanted to own the various businesses that Buffett owns, but you didn’t want to do so by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway? Berkshire Hathaway now has $130 billion in cash but doesn’t pay a dividend. That’s a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines.It’s also not cheap, with a forward P/E of 17.Creating Your Own Mini Berkshire HathawayAnyone can mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio. That’s easy. The company files Form 4s every quarter disclosing what stocks they are buying, and selling.But what about its other businesses? It owns See’s Candy, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railroad, Nebraska Furniture Market and a bunch of other companies.5 Berkshire-Like Companies You Could Buy Right Now1.       Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)Union Pacific Corp. is a big American railroad, similar to Berkshire’s BNSF.Shares of Union Pacific are down 4.3% year-to-date but it’s not that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 17.8.Earnings are expected to be up 0.09% this year and 7.1% in 2024. But is that enough to pay 17.8x?Should you buy Union Pacific, and old economy stock, in 2023?Story continues2.       Haverty Furniture (HVT)Haverty Furniture operates 100 showrooms in 16 southern and Midwest states. Founded in 1885, Haverty is in the same mold as some of Buffett’s furniture investments like Nebraska Furniture Market.Shares of Haverty have fallen 14.6% year-to-date. It’s dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. Haverty also pays a dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.However, with the US housing market slowing, so are Haverty’s sales. Sales fell 5.9% in the first quarter.Is Haverty a deal?3.       The Hershey Company (HSY)Hershey is a confection and food company that makes famous candy brands such as Reese’s and Almond Joy. While it’s not identical to Berkshire’s See’s Candy, it’s the closest publicly traded candy company out there.Hershey shares have been on a tear in 2023, gaining 18.7%. It’s also near a 5-year high. But Hershey doesn’t come cheap. It’s trading at 29x.Is Hershey over bought?4.       Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG)Signet Jewelers is an option if you want to own a jewelry store like Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway bought Helzberg Diamonds in 1996.Shares of Signet Jewelers are up 5.5% year-to-date and 88% over the last 5 years. The 5-year performance easily beats the S&amp;P 500, which is up 51.7% during that time.Signet Jewelers is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.2.Should you consider Signet Jewelers even thought a recession may be coming?5.       Redfin Corp. (RDFN)Redfin is a real estate brokerage. Did you know that Berkshire Hathaway also owns one? It’s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.It’s been a wild couple of years for Redfin’s shares. Over the last 2 years, it’s down 78% but in 2023, Redfin is hot, gaining 161%.Redfin doesn’t have a P/E as earnings are expected to be negative in both 2023 and 2024.Is a rebound in housing already priced into Redfin shares?What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About Creating a Mini Berkshire Hathaway?

DCI is benefiting from its strong product portfolio, solid demand and focus on innovation and growth investments despite adversities from the high cost of sales and foreign exchange headwinds. Presence in diverse end markets, including construction, mining, aerospace, defense and food &amp; beverage, helps the company offset weaknesses associated with a single market.Growth in On-Road and Off-Road sales, supported by elevated levels of medium and heavy-duty equipment production is driving DCI’s Mobile Solutions segment’s revenues. Aftermarket sales are being aided by improved global supply-chain conditions. Sales growth in industrial filtration solutions and aerospace and defense is supporting the Industrial Solutions segment’s sales.Acquired assets are strengthening DCI’s top line. Donaldson acquired Isolere Bio in February 2023, which enabled it to create leading separation and filtration solutions for emerging genetic-based drugs. Also, the acquisition of Purilogics, LLC (June 2022) strengthened the company’s life sciences portfolio by leveraging the acquired entity’s unique product offerings. The Solaris Biotechnology (in November 2021) buyout strengthened its presence across several end markets, including food and beverage, biopharma and other major life sciences.Donaldson’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are noteworthy. The company’s dividend payments totaled $110.1 million in fiscal 2022 and $56.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023. It also bought back shares worth $171 million in fiscal 2022 and $115.2 million in the first six months of fiscal 2023.Donaldson Company, Inc. PriceDonaldson Company, Inc.

55,4e94eb9f-79e2-3e30-9525-5532800cde8d,ADM,2023-05-13,7 Dividend Stocks That Will Pay You Through Any Market Turmoil,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-pay-market-001723143.html,1683591443,STORY,"['XOM', 'IBM', 'ABBV', 'NEE', 'DUK', 'ADM']","[While there’s nothing quite as exciting as betting everything on a hot growth enterprise, prudent investors may want to consider the best dividend stocks for market crash. In late April, CNBC reported that investors face the threat of persistently higher inflation while simultaneously digesting a bleak economic outlook. If the Federal Reserve is truly making headway against inflation, recession fears should ease. Yet we’re often left with ambiguity. In such a situation, recession-proof dividend stocks should be ideal. Finally, enterprises that pay passive income tend to be more reliable than those that don’t.With that, below are ideas for safe dividend stocks in volatile market.DUKDuke Energy$98.90ABBVAbbVie$147.45BUDAnheuser-Busch$64.68NEENextEra Energy$76.06IBMIBM.$123.40XOMExxon Mobil$109.11ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$75.40InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a utility play that benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, nothing legally prevents other companies from competing with Duke. However, because the barrier to entry for the utility sector is so steep, no one even bothers. Therefore, DUK inherently stands alone in its core coverage area, which includes some Southern and Midwestern states.Financially, Duke doesn’t natively offer the greatest-looking paper. However, it does rank well in terms of consistent profitability. In the trailing one-year period, the power company holds an operating margin of 22.33%. This stat beats out 75.75% of sector rivals. For passive income, Duke’s forward yield comes in at 4.05%. That’s a bit higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Also, the company commands 18 years of consecutive dividend increases, putting DUK on the best dividend stocks for market crash list. Finally, analysts peg DUK  a moderate buy with a $108.13 average price target.Story continuesAbbVie (ABBV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) makes a strong case for recession-proof dividend stocks to buy. Basically, even under negative economic cycles, scientific research will push forward, seeking to address various human ailments. Under this context, I’m not particularly worried about ABBV’s loss of nearly 9% of equity value since the Jan. opener. Eventually, AbbVie will rise above the muck.For now, intrepid investors might consider shares undervalued. At the moment, ABBV trades at 10.77-times free cash flow (FCF). In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 23.41 times. Also, the company enjoys a solid three-year revenue growth rate (13.4%) as well as a trailing-year net margin (13.37%). It also belongs on the safe dividend stocks in volatile market list. AbbVie’s forward yield pings at 4%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 53.28%. Also, it commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Obviously, this attribute qualifies ABBV for the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Lastly, analysts peg ABBV a moderate buy with a $162.79 price target. This estimate implies 10% upside potential.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockI’m going to dip my toes into the controversy with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD). By now, I’m sure you’ve all heard about the uproar. It’s quite possible that you may have strong feelings about the underlying issues. That’s great. However, the angst over Anheuser-Busch – based on historical trends – is unlikely to sustain itself. Therefore, BUD really could be a discounted opportunity for the best dividend stocks for market crash designation.Though up nearly 9% for the year, BUD slipped more than 2% in the trailing month. However, this doesn’t justify hitting the panic button. Remember, Nike (NYSE:NKE) stood by Colin Kaepernick during the anthem protest controversy. The sports apparel manufacturer is doing just fine now (relatively speaking). Also, the Equifax (NYSE:EFX) data breach hurt millions, probably including you. EFX has also performed well since the scandal.So, one person’s identity transition won’t mean squat in the end. Turning to passive income, BUD’s forward yield is 2.54%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Notably, the payout ratio sits in the credibly sustainable side at 44.43%. To close out, analysts peg BUD a moderate buy with a $72 price target. The estimate implies 11% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a leader in the renewable energy infrastructure space with its wind and solar projects, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) easily ranks among the best dividend stocks for a market crash list. Basically, even if the unpleasant material hit the proverbial fan, modern societies need energy to survive. As well, the emerging Generation Z cares deeply about sustainability. Therefore, companies ignore this trend at their peril.Financially, NextEra offers somewhat of a similar profile to other utilities in that it could always use some work. For example, its balance sheet isn’t exactly sterling. If I’m being honest, much of the operational side could use some beefing up. However, its consistently profitable and it prints an impressive net margin of 26.97%.And that segues into passive income, where NextEra’s forward yield comes in at 2.48%. While lower than the utility sector average, NEE commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it belongs in the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy with an $89.64 price target. The estimate implies nearly 19% upside potential.IBM (IBM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockWhile legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) constantly wrestles with its reputation as being a boring enterprise, it no longer must tolerate insults about being irrelevant. With management aggressively pivoting toward pertinent sectors such as hybrid-cloud endeavors, IBM can duke it out with the others. However, it’s trading at a relative discount right now, with shares down almost 13% since the January opener.In addition, IBM belongs on the best dividend stocks for market crash list because of its fundamental value proposition. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 13.09. As a discount to projected earnings, IBM ranks better than 81.49% of the competition.Switching to passive income, “Big Blue” carries a forward yield of 5.37%. Thus, it’s legitimately one of the high-yield dividend stocks for market turmoil. Also, the company features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Looking to the Street, analysts peg IBM a moderate buy with a $147.71 price target. The estimate implies over 19% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockStanding alongside some of the biggest hydrocarbon energy firms in the world, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) needs no introduction. Though fossil fuels may be going out of style in the ideological front, they remain incredibly relevant today. Because of their high energy density and reliability, they may continue to be relevant for years to come. Therefore, it inks entry into the best dividend stocks for market crash list.Financially, Exxon Mobil benefits from strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 15.9%, above 65.09% of its peers. Also, its net margin lands at 15.63%, ranked better than 68.13% of sector peers. As a “bonus,” Exxon also benefits from robust stability in the balance sheet.Heading over to the passive income side, XOM’s forward yield is 3.35%, a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, the underlying company features 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Of course, that qualifies for the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Lastly, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy with a $130.96 price target. The estimate implies almost 21% upside potential.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) by default earns inclusion into the best dividend stocks for market crash list. Essentially, humans have to eat. Bad things happen when we don’t. Nevertheless, the market doesn’t see it that way, with ADM losing over 15% of equity value since the Jan. opener.While Archer Daniels beat profit forecasts, management’s forward guidance disappointed. Nevertheless, the red ink might present an opportunity for intrepid investors. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to projected earnings, ADM ranks better than 77.31% of the field. Regarding passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 2.37%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, it enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. So, it’s not just one of the dividend aristocrats for market downturn; it’s really a dividend king (50 or more years of increases).On a final note, analysts peg ADM a strong buy with a $101 price target. The estimate implies 33% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Per the deal, the company is now authorized to resell ReversingLabs’ SSCS Platform with its Software Integrity Group’s Black Duck solution.ReversingLabs’ SSCS platform will complement the capabilities of Synopsys’ Black Duck solution by scanning commercial third-party components for vulnerabilities, malware and instances of software tampering. This will aid SNPS to automatically create comprehensive and actionable software bill of materials (SBOMs) throughout its software supply chain.Synopsys’ Black Duck software composition analysis helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers. Meanwhile, the SSCS platform addresses SBOM requirements and software supply chain attacks as part of software development and continuous integration and delivery workflows.The latest integration is likely to provide additional security risk insight to the development teams to identify malware, software tampering and anomalies inserted in software fast and avert supply chain threats before release.Synopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteSynopsys has been benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. The company’s penetration into new and growing artificial intelligence chip companies is a major growth driver. With the increasing need for enhanced security measures, considering the rising security threats in interconnected systems laden with software, demand for Synopsys’ solutions is shooting up. Robust growth in software-based verification at both traditional semiconductor and emerging system companies focused on its own in-house design is an upside.Last month, Synopsys reinforced its collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer Company and Ansys for the design and manufacture of multi-die systems. Multi-die systems integrate heterogeneous dies in a single package, providing a path for designers to efficiently deliver innovative products with unprecedented functionality. By reusing proven dies, designers reduce risks, accelerate time to market and rapidly create new product variants with optimized system power and performance.Story continuesIn a separate deal, in the same month, SNPS introduced the first-of-its-kind ZeBu Server 5 emulation system. It can deliver up to 30 billion gates capacity, two times higher throughput and improved energy use with less than half power consumption compared with its predecessor.In first-quarter fiscal 2023, the Synopsys Electronic Design Automation segment reported revenues of $874.3 million, up 12.3% on a year-over-year basis.

For more Morgan Stanley stocks, head on over to Morgan Stanley's Top 5 Stock Picks For 2023. If there's one thing that can be said for sure about 2022, it's that the year turned out to be a lot different than many investors, executives, or even members of the general public were expecting. The coronavirus outbreak of 2019 lasted for two years, and with it came the constant hide and seek of lockdowns. This ended up paralyzing economic activity, and the stock market was kept afloat only through stimulus measures after an initial wipeout at the start of 2020 that saw major indexes bleed as much as 30% of their values within days.However, with 2022 starting, the virus had started to slow down and vaccinations were in full flow, giving all sectors some hope of a return to normalcy. However, generous spending by governments during the pandemic was waiting to strike back in the form of painful inflation, even as several industry leaders such as Bill Ackman warned that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates. Just as this debate was going on, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine started in full flow, and the rest is history. The combined effect of a global energy supply chain rebalancing and a determined Fed sapped investor confidence once again, and major stock market indexes once again bled their value.Now, as 2023 starts, investors are cautiously optimistic. Indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite, S&amp;P 500, and the NYSE Composite are up by 14.73%, 7.5%, and 4.74%, respectively, hinting that the market as a whole believes that inflation might come down soon. This cautious aura of positivity is also present in the mind of the legendary Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, who, in a recent video, shared a rather interesting take on why 2023 just might be the year everyone is happy:One of the points that I have made often. I have used this for decades. It's worked regularly. And I believe it will work now in particular, is that third years of U.S. Presidents' terms - which is what 2023 is - tend to be overwhelmingly positive. We haven't had a negative third year of a U.S. President's term in the United States of America since 1939 which was only down nine-tenths of one percent. In the accurate measured history of the stock market, only down twice. The fact is 1939 as you recall, we were going into World War 2 - a pretty bad negative thing. As I have said in prior videos, talking about what I call the midterm miracle, which is the nine months that begin October 1st of the midterm election year 2022, which has worked perfectly in the fourth quarter of 2022.Those nine months, collectively, are the most consistently profitable nine months span in U.S. stock market history - positive 92% of history, with an overall 20% positivity. But that is because of the gridlock, or the relative gridlock, created in the midterms which rolls right on over into those first two quarters - calendar quarters - of the next year, the third year of the President's term. And traditionally, although not always, it is the first half of that year tied to that realization that the government isn't going to change a lot of taxes, isn't going to change a lot of property rights, isn't going to be able to create a whole lot of new regulation, when people have been all through the first and second years of the President's term fighting over all of that stuff, which was abundantly clear in 2021 and 2022. That relative calm ushers in peace, longer term investing horizon for businesses and capital expenditure, and people in their investment activities, and it buoys stocks up. It's a form of surprise that no one expects, but it always works.Story continuesWith these details in mind, we thought to take a look at what the investment professionals at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are saying and how well their stock picks are performing in 2023.

Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall joins us now with the details. Hey, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Hey, Rachelle. Well, nearly 100% of Southwest pilots have voted in favor of a strike. It comes after several years of negotiations as pilots push for an overhaul of the carrier's scheduling system. That doesn't mean they walk off the job right away. Now federal law prohibits them from actually striking unless allowed by the National Mediation Board. That's the federal agency that oversees labor relations and negotiations in the airline industry, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And you think of the timing. I mean, this does not sound good, and begs the question, has there ever been a pilot strike in the summer?DIANE KING HALL: Yes, so there have been strikes in the past, but they are rare. Spirit pilots went on strike in the summer of 2010. That was just for a week. It did have an impact, and the last time, though, a major carrier dealt with a pilot strike was 25 years ago, when Northwest Airlines, you may remember that name, pilots struck for two weeks.It is a tenuous time between industry top brass and the unions. American Airlines pilots also recently voted in favor of a strike and United pilots are out picketing today. Now keep in mind about 80% of US air travel is handled by American, Southwest, United, and Delta Airlines. So the powers that be want to do what they can to avoid a strike.Last year, Delta pilots voted in favor of a strike before eventually striking a new deal, that included pay raises over a four-year term. This all comes at a time when the government is trying to hold the airline industry to account for controllable issues. Now, the Biden administration proposed a rule earlier this week, it feels like longer ago, that would mandate compensating passengers for flight cancellations or major delays.Story continuesWhy does that matter? New federal data shows that most flight delays over the past several years were due to issues within the carrier's control. And Southwest has to perform well this summer season, given what happened in the winter. And I want to give a quick check on where Southwest shares are right now.They're under a little bit of pressure, down about 8% as investors just try to read the tea leaves on what does this mean. I mean, Southwest has been having, I would say a rough year, but it's been ongoing since the end of last year, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Yeah, we remember that winter nightmare. Hopefully it doesn't come to that. A big thank you there, Diane King Hall. Thanks so much.]"

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Virtually all (99%) of the 98% of eligible pilots who cast a vote were in favor of the authorization. The vote does not mean a walkout is imminent; Southwest, in a statement, said the result has “no impact on our scheduled operations.”For the past three years, Southwest and its pilots’ union have been working on a new deal, but have failed to come to terms. The pressure was increased on the airline earlier this year when Delta Air Lines agreed to an industry-changing pilot contract that offers $7 billion in higher pay and benefits.And as the negotiations have failed to yield an agreement, rhetoric on both sides is starting to ramp up.“The lack of leadership and the unwillingness to address the failures of our organization have led us to this point,” said Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, in a statement. “Our pilots are tired of apologizing to our passengers on behalf of a company that refuses to place its priorities on its internal and external customers.”""Our negotiating team continues to bargain in good faith and work toward reaching a new agreement to reward our Pilots,"" replied Adam Carlisle, vice president of labor relations at Southwest Airlines, in a statement of his own. ""This anticipated authorization vote result does not change our commitment to the negotiation process, and we look forward to continuing discussions with SWAPA at the negotiating table.""Southwest and its pilots might still be far apart, but in the past few months it has struck collective bargaining agreements with other work groups, including its meteorologists and its customer service employees.Story continuesIn January, the carrier also offered millions in bonus pay to its employees for holiday disruptions, which left many workers helpless, and stranded passengers. Southwest gave approximately $45 million to its pilots' union, which works out to about $4,500 per pilot. That’s on top of bonuses that were already given for holidays and flight reassignments.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This heightened labor-related tensions for the Dallas-based company. Per the Southwest Pilots Association, the voting procedure (whose duration was more than a week) saw 98% of the total pilots cast their votes. Of them 99% pilots voted in favor of a strike.The union raised its voice against the lack of progress after three-plus years of negotiations that has led to many operational disasters at LUV. Casey Murray, the president of the union, said, ""Our pilots are tired of apologizing to our passengers on behalf of a company that refuses to place its priorities on its internal and external customers.""Even though pilots have voted in favor of a strike it is highly doubtful that the same will materialize eventually as the law makes it extremely difficult. So negotiations are likely to continue. The union hopes that this strike approval will exert pressure on the airline in the ongoing negotiations. However, the union has assured that scheduled operations will not be impacted.This move by the pilots increases problems at LUV, which has already been struggling due to the December 2022 operational disruption. The unfavorable impact owing to massive flight cancellations resulted in the carrier incurring loss in first-quarter 2023.Mainly due to operational disruptions, shares of Southwest Airlines have declined 14% year to date. This compares unfavorably to the Zacks Airline industry's 6.1% appreciation in the same timeframe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may consider stocks like Copa Holdings CPA and United Airlines UAL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

In first-quarter 2023, cargo and mail revenues grew 51.8% from the comparable quarter of 2019 on higher cargo volumes and yields.Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised 6.15% upward over the past 60 days.United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand.

And Southwest is one of them, facing some possible turbulence after pilots for the airline voted for a potential strike as extended contract negotiations come to a head. Now, we don't know yet if the strike is actually going to happen. This is authorization for a strike. And they called an early end to voting after all of them. I mean, was pretty overwhelming, this vote to authorize the strike.- Yeah, this is not the first strike that we've seen authorized. Not all of them actually go through to a full-on strike that disbands or at least impacts some of the day-in, day-out operations. We had seen one from American Airlines. Of course, that was earlier this month.Even the Delta Pilots Union, they were able to come to an agreement eventually and negotiate with the executives and leaders. And we asked and spoke with Delta CEO Ed Bastian about that in the past for about two quarters at this point. And so usually these net out well for the pilots. And this is right for the pilots to do, considering the changing fleets of aircraft that they're also going to be asked to pilot or to steer the ship on.And so what they're asking for within this specifically and what the Pilots Association that represents about 10,000 pilots for the Dallas carrier, just taking a look at the authorization vote, it closed after a week and a half, 98% participation, 99% of pilots voting to authorize the strike. And the statement saying that the lack of leadership and unwillingness to address the failures of this organization, of the organization, have led to this point. And the pilots are tired of apologizing to passengers on behalf of-- get this-- a company that refuses to place its priorities on its internal and external customers there. So those are some fighting words, as. We would call them here on this Friday.- Yeah, most definitely. So we'll see if the strike actually ends up happening now.- Yeah, yeah, exactly.]"

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board Jeffrey Joerres made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$99k worth of shares at a price of US$12.84 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$11.96). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Jeffrey Joerres was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Does Western Union Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.7% of Western Union shares, worth about US$31m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Western Union Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Western Union shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders do have a stake in Western Union and their transactions don't cause us concern. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Dividend investments provide a strong income stream and can help investors remain calm in a volatile market. However, there are some dividend trap stocks out there as not all are created equal. After all, a dividend generally comes out of a company’s earnings and cash flows. If earnings and cash flows decline, the safety of the dividend must be called into question.Given the current economic storm, there is a particularly high level of risk out there right now. Surging inflation and interest rates combined with a slumping real estate market have created a perfect storm for real estate investment trusts (REITs) in particular. Some dividends are likely to be slashed in coming months and years.Make sure your portfolio is clear of these three dividend stocks to avoid in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArbor Realty Trust (ABR)Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukArbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR) is a REIT focused primarily on multi-family housing backed bridge loans. The company is focused on the southern United States, with Texas, Florida and Georgia being their largest markets.What’s the matter with Arbor? Bridge loans are inherently quite risky, as they serve as a sort of intermediate financing for property owners. A buyer will get a bridge loan and then try to seek longer-term financing at a lower interest rate to pay off the bridge loan. In normal times, that’s fine. However, when property prices start to decline and banks are scared to make new loans, it may become difficult for borrowers to refinance their bridge loans and pay Arbor on time.Additionally, short sellers have raised concerns about Arbor’s management team. NINGI Research published a blistering report suggesting massive downside in ABR stock based on purportedly bad mobile home loans, understated off-balance sheet liabilities and a variety of other concerns. The well-known research firm Hedgeye also labeled Arbor’s corporate governance as “atrocious” in a recent tweet.Story continuesOn paper, ABR stock is offering a 14% dividend yield. Yet, even with that huge yield and the decline in Arbor’s share price, short sellers aren’t going anywhere; short interest remains in the double digits as a percentage of float. All this speaks to a dividend at great risk if and when the multifamily housing market sinks.Paramount Group (PGRE)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockParamount Group (NYSE:PGRE) is an office REIT focused on New York City and San Francisco. The causes for alarm should jump out right from the description.Office properties have been in trouble in most parts of the country thanks to remote work. Many businesses simply aren’t returning to five days a week in the office, meaning demand for space is down. The effect might not be catastrophic overnight, but in a leveraged industry like real estate, even marginal declines in profitability can have a massive impact on cash flows and thus the dividend.Making matters worse, Paramount has a high degree of exposure to the ailing banking industry. In March, one of its tenants, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), went bust. Paramount had just increased the size of its leasing contract with the failed bank last year, making this a bitter blow.And then the hammer fell last week with First Republic Bancorp’s (NASDAQ:FRBK) collapse. First Republic was, worryingly enough, Paramount’s single largest tenant. It remains unclear what will happen to these office spaces now that SVB and First Republic have failed. However, it speaks to the deep and structural problems facing office REITs in general and Paramount Group in particular.Simon Property Group (SPG)the interior of a crowded shopping mallSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is one of America’s leading mall operators. The company has been in business for decades and has had tremendous returns since its IPO.However, the future is unlikely to be nearly as bright as the past. That’s because Simon is a mall company. And shopping malls simply don’t hold the same appeal in 2023 as they once did. The rise of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer retail has gotten rid of much of the need for malls. Brands no longer need huge stores in every city to show their wares. And consumers can find far more selection online than on a shelf.Simon has taken steps to try to address this. It has invested heavily in outlets, which may hold more lasting appeal than enclosed malls. It has also launched international shopping centers, hoping to diversify away from the U.S. mall market. Simon is also investing heavily in redeveloping its older malls, spending $500 million last year alone to remodel and refurbish properties.This is all well and good, but Simon is fighting an uphill climb. There remain tons of aging department stores which will likely become obsolete over the next decade. Redeveloping these large vacant mall spaces into restaurants, entertainment, gyms or other purposes will cost countless millions.Simon posted a mere 3% revenue growth last year, even amid a booming consumer shopping environment and high inflation. As the economy seemingly heads toward recession, Simon’s revenues and earnings are likely to decline. That will put pressure on SPG’s stock price and dividend.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Hear from the biggest names in the space, including the CEOs of RXO, Clean Harbors, and Johnson Controls. Here are our three big takeaways from the event.First up, artificial intelligence, AI, the buzzword that's got Wall Street's attention. It's starting to transform the industrial sector with more companies jumping on board.DREW WILKERSON: We've been investing in AI for over a decade. And so if you think about the pricing algorithms that we've got that allow us to have best-in-class margins, it's because with every load that goes into the system, our algorithms get that much smarter on a pricing perspective for both the customer and the carriers.We're also using AI for customer integrations. What we see is that we're able to have our employees be able to do more per day.SEANA SMITH: A bull market awaits. It's almost like, what recession risk? The industrial economy is seeing signs of a recovery.JOE RITCHIE: Today we are in the start of a very significant infrastructure build in the US. Some might call it a US manufacturing renaissance. The level of spending that's occurring today is unprecedented. And so the tone coming out of the conference the last two days has been very bullish.SEANA SMITH: Worker shortage. Business leaders are having trouble hiring and retaining top talent.MICHAEL BATTLES: We've had trouble. Our turnover, it's not just hiring people, it's retaining the people that we have, and lowering our turnover rate down to pre-COVID levels, which has been terrific. So in my mind, I think it's as important to keep our own employees and provide a good career path for them as it is to hire more capable bodies.It is improving, more holidays, better healthcare costs, providing a career path for our employee.[MUSIC PLAYING]]"

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Goldman Sachs in FocusGoldman Sachs (GS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -6.6% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $2.5 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.12%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.52%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.76%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 29.89%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 36%, meaning it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for GS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $31.83 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.89%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Starting with Goldman Sachs International Small Cap Insights IR (GIRLX) should not be a possibility at this time. GIRLX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerGoldman Sachs is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of GIRLX. Goldman Sachs International Small Cap Insights IR made its debut in August of 2010, and since then, GIRLX has accumulated about $89.63 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 0.68%, and is in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 10.41%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, GIRLX's standard deviation comes in at 18.43%, compared to the category average of 16.05%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 19.7% compared to the category average of 15.97%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. GIRLX has a 5-year beta of 0.94, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -8.89, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, GIRLX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.99% compared to the category average of 1.13%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, GIRLX is actually cheaper than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Goldman Sachs International Small Cap Insights IR ( GIRLX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Schlumberger's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:21% = US$3.9b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.21.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 21% ROEAt first glance, Schlumberger seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. Probably as a result of this, Schlumberger was able to see an impressive net income growth of 23% over the last five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Schlumberger's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 7.7% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is SLB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Schlumberger Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The three-year median payout ratio for Schlumberger is 28%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 72%. So it seems that Schlumberger is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Besides, Schlumberger has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 32%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Schlumberger's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Schlumberger's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

76,bd393f4b-ea23-3344-a047-931cc601c18e,AIG,2023-05-13,American International Group's (NYSE:AIG) three-year earnings growth trails the solid shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-groups-nyse-aig-130016767.html,1683896416,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 14% in the last quarter. In contrast, the return over three years has been impressive. In three years the stock price has launched 105% higher: a great result. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.Since the stock has added US$1.9b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for American International Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.American International Group was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 27% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into American International Group's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of American International Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, American International Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 123%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican International Group shareholders are down 7.4% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 5.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for American International Group   you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The new pricing, according to the website, is only for premium content, while the matches continue to stream for free.Viacom18 won the IPL digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027 for around $2.9 billion, rights which Disney previously held.Ambani has a reputation of disrupting rivals in the price-sensitive Indian market with cheap offers.Karan Taurani, a senior vice president of India's Elara Capital specialising in the media and entertainment sectors, said Reliance's streaming offer price was at the lower end versus rivals that but more content would be needed to succeed.""Only with pure play HBO content you may not get a large scale (of customers) ... 999 definitely is at the lower end of the band, many of the other platforms, they are all in the range of 1,000 plus and it goes up to 2,000"" rupees, he said.JioCinema is in talks with various production studios and has plans to introduce dozens of TV shows and movies on the platform in the coming months, in Hindi and other languages, Reuters reported last month.

The streaming giant shares, they're moving to the downside. They're off about 1.5%, echoing the declines that we're seeing in the broader market. And it follows a new ""Wall Street Journal"" report, which revealed the company plans to reduce its spending by $300 million this year.Netflix, of course, is a notorious spender in the streaming wars. But it's looking to cut costs after pushing that broader password sharing crackdown into the second quarter. According to the ""Journal,"" there will be no hiring freezes or layoffs as a result of this pullback. But management has been told to be cautious with their spending.And, guys, this is something that we're seeing really across the media sector right now as investors shift focus to profitability and look to stem those streaming losses. We just heard from Disney, they are looking to slash $5.5 billion worth of costs, which include $3 billion in content costs. So this is something we're seeing across the board.SEANA SMITH: It is something we're seeing across the board, although I will say that Netflix is better positioned than many of its competitors out there when it comes to the streaming space and the fact that they have been profitable now for quite some time. When we talk about the cuts that we're doing, it's also important to put into perspective how small they are in relation to the overall spending that we typically see from Netflix, because operating expenses last year were about $26 billion.So, yes, they are moving to be more conservative. But when you take a look at a whole picture, they still will probably be spending a heck of a lot, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, you know, I keep wondering, how much of this is influenced by the other? I mean, you talked about the cuts at Disney. Now you've got Netflix. At the end of the day, though, I keep looking at some of the major tech players in the space that aren't pure streaming plays, right?You look at Apple, you look at Amazon-- they've got a little more money, especially Apple, to spare here on content at a time when the pure streaming players are having to pull back because of a pullback in ad spending as well. So an interesting one to watch here to see who actually can take advantage of that when some of these names are cutting back on content spending.]"

AEO has been well-placed on the back of cost-reduction efforts, strength in Aerie and a solid online show. Its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan bodes well. The plan is driving profitability through real estate and inventory-optimization efforts, omni-channel and customer focus, and investments to improve the supply chain.As part of the Real Power Real Growth plan, American Eagle will continue to pursue opportunities to grow the Aerie brand through expansion into newer markets, innovation and a growing customer base. The company’s efforts under the plan have aided the recovery of the American Eagle brand. Going forward, it expects to undertake initiatives to deliver growth and sustained profitability for the American Eagle brand.Driven by the trends and progress on its growth plan, American Eagle raised its 2023 financial targets. The company expects to achieve an operating income of $800 million in fiscal 2023. It expects revenues of $5.8 billion for fiscal 2023, up from the earlier mentioned $5.5 billion. The operating income is estimated to be $800 million, with the operating margin expanding to 13.5% by 2023. Previously, the operating income and the operating margin were anticipated to be $550 million and 10%, respectively. Earlier, the company expected revenues for the Aerie brand to reach $2.2 billion by 2023, seeing more than a 20% compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2019. The American Eagle brand is envisioned to grow slightly from fiscal 2019, with $3.6 billion in revenues.Although the stock has declined 9% in the past year, it compares favorably with the industry’s decline of 11.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company echoes a positive sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Eagle’s fiscal 2023 sales and EPS suggests growth of 1.4% and 15.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.Additionally, American Eagle has been witnessing strong digital demand on the shift in consumers’ shopping preferences. Although the company’s total digital revenues were down 9% year over year, the same advanced 19% from the pre-pandemic levels (fourth-quarter fiscal 2019). Digital revenues accounted for 36% of the total revenues, driven by its mobile app, which is now the largest source of revenues in the digital channel. The mobile app business contributed 40% of the total digital spending, driven by a strong engagement across both brands.American Eagle has been witnessing spectacular growth for its Aerie brand for quite some time now. Sales rose 8% to $464 million for Aerie in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenues in 2022, driven by store expansion. Strength across core apparel, positive growth in fleece as well as the best sweater season in the brand's history acted as major growth drivers. Also, its activewear extension, OFFLINE by Aerie, performed well on the back of the Leggings franchise stemming from customer acquisitions. Management previously launched its largest integrated marketing campaign, namely Voices of AerieREAL.Management revealed plans to open 25 stores. The Aerie brand is a key growth engine for American Eagle and has been on track to reach the next brand milestone of $2 billion in sales, out of which it has already achieved $1.5 billion in revenues.Story continuesOther Solid Picks in RetailWe have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks, namely Tecnoglass TGLS, The TJX Companies TJX and The Kroger Co.

TJX is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on May 17. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11,823 million, suggesting an increase of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 71 cents per share. The projection indicates growth of 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings.The TJX Companies has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6%, on average. The off-price retailer’s earnings came in line with the consensus mark in the last reported quarter.We expect first-quarter revenues to increase 3.3% to $11,778.1 million and the bottom line to rise 2.2% to 69 cents.The TJX Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe TJX Companies, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The TJX Companies, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderTJX has been gaining from strength in the Marmaxx segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, U.S. comp store sales grew 7% in Marmaxx, buoyed by solid apparel and accessories categories’ sales. Customer traffic remained the key driver behind comp store sales growth, with the average basket size also increasing. We believe that the continuation of these trends is likely to have aided the company’s overall sales in the quarter under review. However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales for the past few quarters.The TJX Companies has been benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Further, with an increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business.These upsides bode well for the quarter to be reported. For the first quarter, comp store sales are expected to have risen 2-3% and consolidated sales are expected to have increased 3-4% to the $11.7-$11.8 billion band.Apart from this, The TJX Companies has been seeing growth in its pretax profit margin. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, management anticipates a pretax profit margin in the range of 9.2-9.5%, which suggests an increase from the 7.5% reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.However, the company has also been witnessing incremental wage costs and supply-chain costs. On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects high wage and supply-chain costs to remain hurdles in fiscal 2024, which may have persisted in the first quarter as well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for The TJX Companies this time.

As well, its priced at 0.21-times trailing sales, below 89.62% of its peers. On the balance sheet, the company offers decent metrics.

Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) mostly focuses on the retail and refining aspect of the energy value chain. In other words, if you’re pumping gasoline into your car, you’re dealing with a downstream player. Fundamentally, Phillips 66 benefits from a captive audience. For the majority of American households, making the transition to electrification isn’t financially feasible. Therefore, PSX makes a cynical case for inflation-resistant stocks.Further, PSX may be one of the discounted inflation-beating stocks. Right now, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 3.61. As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 76.97% of companies in the oil and gas industry. Also, it trades at 5.15-times free cash flow, ranked better than 63.59% of its peers. Operationally, the company enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9%, above 63.29% of sector players. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 39.3%. On a final note, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stand sat $126.57, implying over 35% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:M) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-inc-nyse-m-largely-145028975.html,1683903028,STORY,['M'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Macy's' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 17 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Macy's. View our latest analysis for Macy's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Macy's?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Macy's. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Macy's, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Macy's. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.6% of common stock, and Arrowstreet Capital, Limited Partnership holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Macy'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Macy's, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$25m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Macy's .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Also, focus on gaming concession in Macau bodes well. However, a decline in traffic from pre-pandemic levels is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthWynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across F&amp;B and retail. During the quarter, non-gaming revenues increased 21% year over year to $50.9 million. The company emphasizes on introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and strong shareholder returns. Attributes such as strong pipeline of forward group demand, continued rooms pricing power and a robust programming calendar bode well.WYNN is benefiting from sound demand for sports betting. It collaborated with several engaging content creators to develop unique sports-themed program. During the first quarter of 2023, the company launched a retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor. Following the launch, the company reported a 20 increase in sign-ups (year-to-date) to its Wynn Rewards loyalty program. The company anticipates solid revenue generation on the back of new product features and a unique marketing campaign.Wynn Resorts derives a solid share of revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the company is confident about prospects in Macau. The worst seems to be over for the gaming industry in Macau as China economy is slowly gaining momentum. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Wynn Resorts (Macau) entered into a 10-year agreement with the Macau government for the renewal of its gaming concession, covering Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai. For 2023, the company expects capex related to concession commitments in the range of $50-$220 million. The company is of the opinion that the proposed capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.The emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently reached an agreement to develop a multibillion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. This move marks Wynn Resorts’ foray into a new market. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region. During the first quarter of 2023, the company progressed with respect to the project design. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development.In the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have gained 61.3% compared with the industry’s 29.6% growth.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsAlthough the company reported solid recovery in Macau and Las Vegas regions in the first quarter, a decline in visitation from pre-pandemic levels is a concern. During the quarter, the company witnessed soft international visitation particularly from Europe and Latin America. Also, disruptions related to the renovation-related closures of Wynn Macau's East casino, added to the downside.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD and Crocs, Inc.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), BP p.l.c. (BP) and Zoetis Inc. (ZTS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares largely tracked the Zacks Tech sector this year, but the stock hasn't looked back since the very strong Q1 earnings release on April 25th. As a result, Microsoft share now up +28.4% this year vs. +22% for the Zacks Tech sector and the +8.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index.  The company is benefitting from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues increased due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft is also seen as having a better offering on the artificial intelligence (AI) front than rival Alphabet. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses.Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues.

Story continuesBP expects $2-$3 billion of divestment and other proceeds in 2023. Before reporting its June-quarter results, the integrated energy major is willing to complete an additional $1.75 billion in share buy-backs. Also, BP reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings resulting from an increase in oil-equivalent production volumes.However, the energy giant’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing exploration expenses have been affecting the company’s income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Zoetis shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.8%). The company’s innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products maintain momentum for the company.The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth.However, Zoetis had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand.

If the Federal Reserve is truly making headway against inflation, recession fears should ease. Yet we’re often left with ambiguity. In such a situation, recession-proof dividend stocks should be ideal. Finally, enterprises that pay passive income tend to be more reliable than those that don’t.With that, below are ideas for safe dividend stocks in volatile market.DUKDuke Energy$98.90ABBVAbbVie$147.45BUDAnheuser-Busch$64.68NEENextEra Energy$76.06IBMIBM.$123.40XOMExxon Mobil$109.11ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$75.40InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuke Energy (DUK)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comAn electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a utility play that benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, nothing legally prevents other companies from competing with Duke. However, because the barrier to entry for the utility sector is so steep, no one even bothers. Therefore, DUK inherently stands alone in its core coverage area, which includes some Southern and Midwestern states.Financially, Duke doesn’t natively offer the greatest-looking paper. However, it does rank well in terms of consistent profitability. In the trailing one-year period, the power company holds an operating margin of 22.33%. This stat beats out 75.75% of sector rivals. For passive income, Duke’s forward yield comes in at 4.05%. That’s a bit higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Also, the company commands 18 years of consecutive dividend increases, putting DUK on the best dividend stocks for market crash list. Finally, analysts peg DUK  a moderate buy with a $108.13 average price target.Story continuesAbbVie (ABBV)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) makes a strong case for recession-proof dividend stocks to buy. Basically, even under negative economic cycles, scientific research will push forward, seeking to address various human ailments. Under this context, I’m not particularly worried about ABBV’s loss of nearly 9% of equity value since the Jan. opener. Eventually, AbbVie will rise above the muck.For now, intrepid investors might consider shares undervalued. At the moment, ABBV trades at 10.77-times free cash flow (FCF). In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 23.41 times. Also, the company enjoys a solid three-year revenue growth rate (13.4%) as well as a trailing-year net margin (13.37%). It also belongs on the safe dividend stocks in volatile market list. AbbVie’s forward yield pings at 4%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 53.28%. Also, it commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. Obviously, this attribute qualifies ABBV for the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Lastly, analysts peg ABBV a moderate buy with a $162.79 price target. This estimate implies 10% upside potential.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockI’m going to dip my toes into the controversy with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD). By now, I’m sure you’ve all heard about the uproar. It’s quite possible that you may have strong feelings about the underlying issues. That’s great. However, the angst over Anheuser-Busch – based on historical trends – is unlikely to sustain itself. Therefore, BUD really could be a discounted opportunity for the best dividend stocks for market crash designation.Though up nearly 9% for the year, BUD slipped more than 2% in the trailing month. However, this doesn’t justify hitting the panic button. Remember, Nike (NYSE:NKE) stood by Colin Kaepernick during the anthem protest controversy. The sports apparel manufacturer is doing just fine now (relatively speaking). Also, the Equifax (NYSE:EFX) data breach hurt millions, probably including you. EFX has also performed well since the scandal.So, one person’s identity transition won’t mean squat in the end. Turning to passive income, BUD’s forward yield is 2.54%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Notably, the payout ratio sits in the credibly sustainable side at 44.43%. To close out, analysts peg BUD a moderate buy with a $72 price target. The estimate implies 11% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a leader in the renewable energy infrastructure space with its wind and solar projects, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) easily ranks among the best dividend stocks for a market crash list. Basically, even if the unpleasant material hit the proverbial fan, modern societies need energy to survive. As well, the emerging Generation Z cares deeply about sustainability. Therefore, companies ignore this trend at their peril.Financially, NextEra offers somewhat of a similar profile to other utilities in that it could always use some work. For example, its balance sheet isn’t exactly sterling. If I’m being honest, much of the operational side could use some beefing up. However, its consistently profitable and it prints an impressive net margin of 26.97%.And that segues into passive income, where NextEra’s forward yield comes in at 2.48%. While lower than the utility sector average, NEE commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it belongs in the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy with an $89.64 price target. The estimate implies nearly 19% upside potential.IBM (IBM)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockWhile legacy technology giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) constantly wrestles with its reputation as being a boring enterprise, it no longer must tolerate insults about being irrelevant. With management aggressively pivoting toward pertinent sectors such as hybrid-cloud endeavors, IBM can duke it out with the others. However, it’s trading at a relative discount right now, with shares down almost 13% since the January opener.In addition, IBM belongs on the best dividend stocks for market crash list because of its fundamental value proposition. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 13.09. As a discount to projected earnings, IBM ranks better than 81.49% of the competition.Switching to passive income, “Big Blue” carries a forward yield of 5.37%. Thus, it’s legitimately one of the high-yield dividend stocks for market turmoil. Also, the company features 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Looking to the Street, analysts peg IBM a moderate buy with a $147.71 price target. The estimate implies over 19% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockStanding alongside some of the biggest hydrocarbon energy firms in the world, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) needs no introduction. Though fossil fuels may be going out of style in the ideological front, they remain incredibly relevant today. Because of their high energy density and reliability, they may continue to be relevant for years to come. Therefore, it inks entry into the best dividend stocks for market crash list.Financially, Exxon Mobil benefits from strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 15.9%, above 65.09% of its peers. Also, its net margin lands at 15.63%, ranked better than 68.13% of sector peers. As a “bonus,” Exxon also benefits from robust stability in the balance sheet.Heading over to the passive income side, XOM’s forward yield is 3.35%, a bit lower than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. However, the underlying company features 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. Of course, that qualifies for the dividend aristocrats for market downturn list. Lastly, analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy with a $130.96 price target. The estimate implies almost 21% upside potential.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) by default earns inclusion into the best dividend stocks for market crash list. Essentially, humans have to eat. Bad things happen when we don’t. Nevertheless, the market doesn’t see it that way, with ADM losing over 15% of equity value since the Jan. opener.While Archer Daniels beat profit forecasts, management’s forward guidance disappointed. Nevertheless, the red ink might present an opportunity for intrepid investors. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 10.93. As a discount to projected earnings, ADM ranks better than 77.31% of the field. Regarding passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 2.37%, above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, it enjoys 51 years of consecutive dividend increases. So, it’s not just one of the dividend aristocrats for market downturn; it’s really a dividend king (50 or more years of increases).On a final note, analysts peg ADM a strong buy with a $101 price target. The estimate implies 33% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As the world moves towards reducing the damage done in the past, we will see soaring demand for companies that are operating in the renewable energy sector. It might take a few years for us to achieve our climate change goals, but we will see a lot of companies benefitting from it. Now is the time for smart investors to consider green dividend growth stocks for their portfolios.As per International Energy Agency’s Electricity Market Report 2023, renewables will dominate the growth of the electricity supply of the world over the next three years. So, while you are looking for high-growth green energy stocks, it wouldn’t hurt to watch out for the green dividend aristocrats. Besides capital appreciation, you will also be able to enjoy a steady passive income. Let’s take a look at the best green dividend stocks to add to your portfolio for a greener and more profitable future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest green dividend stocks: NextEra Energy (NEE)An image of engineers analyzing wind turbines over the hill, data imposed over the imageSource: ConceptCafe/ShutterstockOne of the best green dividend stocks, I’ve already recommended NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) several times in the past. The company has committed to Real Zero, which aims to eliminate emissions from its operations by 2045, and this is a major step forward in the green energy industry. To achieve this goal, it has created the Zero Carbon Blueprint, which has laid out plans to increase the deployment of renewable energy and help the U.S. economy with its decarbonization efforts. NEE stock is trading at $75 today and is up over 6% in the past year.NextEra recently reported quarterly earnings and beat expectations. It reported an EPS of $0.84, and the earnings stood at $1,678 million. The company’s utility business, Florida Power and Light, is steadily growing and will continue to contribute to the total revenue. Its first-quarter income stood at $1,070 million, and the company now has 5.8 million customer accounts.Story continuesInterestingly, the company has a 4,600 MW of solar portfolio, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility company in the U.S. NextEra Energy plans to double the solar capacity additions this year and expects an annual growth rate between 6 to 8% of the 2024 EPS expectations range.One solid reason to bet on this stock is the dividend yield of 2.48%, and the company plans to increase the dividend by 10% a year through 2024. NextEra Energy has paid and increased dividends since 2006 consistently, and it recently declared a dividend of $0.4675. If you think the future is green energy, NEE stock is the one to own for long-term gains.Enbridge (ENB)Source: ShutterstockEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) has a dividend yield of 6.6% which can be an ideal addition to your portfolio amid fears of a looming recession. The North American company is reliant on the cash flow from oil pipelines, and it is taking strong steps to move towards greener alternatives. Trading at $39 today, there are several reasons why Enbridge is one of the best green energy dividend stocks to buy now.Enbridge has the second-largest natural gas pipeline in the U.S. and a solid renewable power generation business. The company recently reported impressive first-quarter results. It produced $3.87 billion in operating cash flow and benefited from the growing volume of the oil pipeline system.Enbridge has made several investments that will continue to generate revenue for it in the coming years. It has invested in 16 solar energy projects, 23 wind farms, one power transmission project, one geothermal project, and five waste heat recovery plants. There is no stopping the momentum of this company, and considering the long-term potential; the stock looks undervalued to me.That said, it recently agreed to acquire a natural gas storage facility in British Columbia, Aitken Creek Storage, for $400 million. The company will acquire the 93.8% stake of FortisBC Holdings in the facility. This deal will play a crucial role in helping the company with Canada’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities.The management has been paying dividends for the past 28 years and has boosted the quarterly dividend to $0.67. It announced the EBITDA guidance between $15.9 billion to $16.5 billion for this year, and I believe the company will be able to beat expectations yet again. ENB is a solid passive income stock to own.Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockNext on my list of the best green dividend stocks is Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC), with a dividend yield of 4.36%. Besides wind and solar power, the company also has a presence in hydroelectric power. The company recently announced quarterly results, and its revenue was up $195.00 million from the same period last year. Its hydroelectric segment contributed the maximum towards revenue, followed by the wind and solar segment. The company has declared a dividend of $0.3375 and aims to increase the dividend by 5% to 9% annually on average, which makes it one of the top green dividend stocks for sustainable income. It has enough liquidity to continue rewarding shareholders in the coming years.BEPC stock is trading at $35 and is up after the solid quarterly results. The stock soared 8% after the company announced positive results. It is up more than 24% year to date and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $42. The company has gained momentum after the announcement of acquiring Origin Energy for $10.2 billion. This deal will help the company lead a massive decarbonization effort in Australia and will help with long-term growth prospects. This is one solid dividend stock to buy and hold as the company is on its path toward massive growth.JP Morgan analyst Mark Strouse has a price target of $49 with an Overweight rating on the stock. The analyst believes that the Inflation Reduction Act is a major policy change in U.S. history to help growth in the transition towards renewables.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

98,38a69e19-db93-3401-9a45-1ed4c1ac97b0,PDCO,2023-05-13,Here's Why You Should Retain Patterson Companies (PDCO) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-patterson-companies-145802705.html,1683903482,STORY,"['PDCO', 'CAH']","[Patterson Companies, Inc. PDCO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 14.6% against the 10% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 2.7% growth.The renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.59 billion. The company projects 7.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 6.2%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about Patterson Companies’ strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In December 2022, Patterson Companies announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Strong Q3 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, Value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies has a significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.4% south to $2.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting a 1.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate of $1.65 billion, suggesting a 0.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to Warren Buffett's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.Billionaire Warren Buffett has time and again proved that he is truly peerless when it comes to investing. His simple style and relentless repetition of age-old, tried and tested and sometimes cliché investing principles make it all look easy. And it seems Buffett’s true genius shines when things are going south for the broader markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that Berkshire also outperforms during recessions and bears markets. The firm says that Berkshire shares have beaten the market for no less than six recessions since 1980 by a median of 4.41 percentage points.During the same time period, Berkshire Hathaway, which is up about 4.5% year to date through May 10, surpassed S&amp;P 500 each time it dropped 20%, beating the broader index by a median of 14.89 percentage points.There are many lessons that could be drawn from decades of jaw-dropping outperformance of the Oracle of Omaha. But the most important and relevant of these is Buffett’s focus on dividends.$5.7 Billion in Cash in a Single YearAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, which cites an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is expected to generate $5.7 billion in cash from its stock portfolio in 2023. Most of this would be coming from dividends. The WSJ report said that a major chunk of this cash would come from some famous dividend stocks that Buffett has huge stakes in.About $1.1 billion would be coming from Chevron, in which Buffett has a huge stake (more on that later in the article). The WSJ report also mentioned that Buffett would collect $700 million each from The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while the Oracle of Omaha will collect about $500 million from Kraft Heinz. From American Express, the billionaire’s check would give him about $363 million.Story continuesAll of this looks very simple at the surface. Just find famous dividend companies, invest in them and collect your payments, right? But if it were that simple Warren Buffett would lose his charm and charisma and the world won’t line up to listen to his advice.Buffett's Secret Sauce: ""The Weeds Wither Away in Significance as the Flowers Bloom""In a letter penned last year, Warren Buffett told about his “secret” of success in dividend investing under a heading “The Secret Sauce.” Buffett’s words sum up decades of wisdom and his foresight.Here’s what he said:""In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.""There are several other dividend stocks in Buffett’s portfolio in addition to the famous dividend-paying companies we mentioned above. In this article we are going to take a look at all of the important dividend-paying companies in Buffett's portfolio. Dividend payments from these companies would help the legendary investor get $5.7 billion in cash this year.Warren Buffett's Top Dividend PicksOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Berkshire’s 13F portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2022 and picked the top dividend-paying companies in which the fund had stakes. The list is ranked in ascending order of the stake values of Berkshire in these companies. Some notable names in the list include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc.

For complementing this move, the tech giant has collaborated with Maldives Transport &amp; Contracting Company (""MTCC"") and Bank of Maldives (""BML"").The innovative solution has been devised with the help of MA’s technology, Mastercard Payment Gateway Services, and thereby, will enable seamless digital payments throughout the public transport network of Maldives.All a commuter in the country needs to do is place a debit or credit card on the ticketing device of a bus or ferry terminal and subsequently, make seamless payments for their journey. The new solution also enables passengers to purchase online tickets in advance through the Raajje Transport Link (“RTL”) mobile app. Additionally, the launch also remains equipped to help commuters without a credit or debit card. All they need to do is claim an RTL-Mastercard co-branded prepaid card.In addition to benefiting the country’s residents, the transit solution is expected to be of great help to overseas tourists visiting Maldives as well. The visitors can enjoy a hassle-free journey with their credit or debit cards, and thereby, do away with the hassles of currency exchange. The recent launch reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to extend modernized payment solutions in order to boost the uptake of digital payments across the globe. And this time, the focus of MA remains to simplify a commuter’s journey and infuse digitization within the transit system of Maldives.Mastercard has often partnered with government and private sector entities of different countries in order to complement the abovementioned endeavor. As an example of the same, MA took the help of LMK Resources Pakistan (Private) Limited for rolling out an open-loop payment solution to digitize the transit system of the country.In this manner, an enhanced digital suite of Mastercard, built through constant tie-ups and significant investments, is likely to help in establishing a solid presence across the globe.Story continuesThe rollout of the open-loop payment system is also aptly timed owing to its several benefits over cash usage or closed-loop payments. In such time-consuming payment systems, fare cards need to be loaded with a prepaid amount, which have to be refilled as soon as it gets exhausted. But open-loop payments are hassle-free in nature as they remain connected to the existing accounts or the daily payment products of the consumers.Shares of Mastercard have gained 19.1% in a year, compared with the industry’s 10.3% growth. MA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are SPX Technologies, Inc.

PGTI reported mixed results for first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Apr 1, 2023). Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missed the same. Yet, both the metrics grew year over year, backed by strong operational execution, solid pricing actions taken to offset materials and wage inflation, and cost containment measures.Following the results, shares of this national leader in premium windows and doors plunged about 3% during the trading session on May 11. Investors’ sentiments might have been hurt by the tepid Q2 guidance.Nonetheless, the company’s backlog grew compared to last quarter, thanks to a solid repair &amp; remodel channel, which offset the softness in housing demand.Jeff Jackson, PGTI’s president and chief executive officer, stated, “For the total Company, we saw a contraction in new construction demand versus prior year but are cautiously optimistic that new construction will rebound in the coming quarters based on recent industry reports. Fortunately, the strength in our repair and remodel channel has allowed us to offset softness in new construction.”Inside the Headline NumbersThe company reported adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, which surpassed the consensus mark of 44 cents by 27.3% and increased 33.3% year over year.PGT, Inc.

QuoteIts net sales of $376.8 million missed the consensus mark of $379 million by 0.5% but grew 5% year over year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 3%. The Southeast segment reported 3.8% net sales growth. The Western segment recorded a 9.1% year-over-year rise.Total Open Order backlog of $236 million was sequentially up from $235 million on strong R&amp;R demand, partially offset by lower new construction demand. Orders in the Southeast region grew 15% year over year. Western region organic orders declined 16% from the previous year due to wet weather in California and Arizona.Story continuesMarginsThe company’s gross profit increased 10.9% year over year to $149.2 million. Also, gross margin of 39.6% expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18.4% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $70 million and adjusted EBITDA margin surged 210 bps to 18.6%.Balance SheetAs of Apr 1, 2023, PGT Innovations had cash and cash equivalents of $48.3 million compared with $66.5 million at fiscal 2022-end.

Owing to the persisting material inflation and market softness, PGTI anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $70-$75 million, down from $78 million reported in the prior year period.For the second quarter, the company expects depreciation and amortization to be within $15-$16 million, interest expense of approximately $8 million, stock-based compensation of nearly $3 million, capital expenditure (as a percentage of net sales) in the 4%-5% range and a tax rate between 25% and 26%.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesPGTI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

103,f2f5ffed-119f-3c2b-bf94-50a5cd4aaa8c,PHM,2023-05-13,"PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-trending-stock-130001209.html,1683896401,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +15.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 10%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +28.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.78 points to a change of -18.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +18.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.82 indicates a change of +0.4% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +21.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.3%. The $14.84 billion and $14.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -8.6% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more cities in this selection, go to the 5 Best US Cities for People With Allergies.According to Allied Market Research, the market for allergy treatments was valued at $24.6 billion in 2017. As per projections, this figure is set to increase to $40.3 billion by 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3% from 2018 to 2025. The rise in the prevalence of allergic diseases, an increasing preference for over-the-counter medications for allergy treatment, and a growing trend of self-medication among consumers are among the main driving forces behind the growth of the global market for allergy treatment. Furthermore, the effects of climate change have resulted in prolonged and warmer growing seasons, consequently leading to increased pollen counts from trees, grass, and weeds. In certain regions of the United States, pollen is now present throughout the year. Allergic conditions rank among the prevalent medical conditions in the US, impacting a significant portion of the population. Each year, over 100 million Americans experience various types of allergies.According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), seasonal allergic rhinitis, commonly known as ""hay fever,"" is one of the most widespread allergic conditions, with approximately 26% of adults and 19% of children having received a diagnosis for this condition in 2021. As per Future Market Insights, in terms of geographic distribution, North America accounted for approximately one-third of the global seasonal allergy market value in 2022, primarily due to the growing incidence of seasonal allergies within the region. While in terms of the distribution of drugs, hospital pharmacies held a significant share of approximately 35.9% due to their access to a wide range of specialty drugs that may not be readily available at retail pharmacies. New allergy treatment options, including anti-IL-5 therapy and anti-IgE therapy, and the development of minimally invasive allergy testing approaches such as skin patch testing and blood tests are some of the key trends expected to drive the growth of the allergy market.Story continuesDifferent strategies are being adopted by manufacturers in the allergy care industry to capture a greater market share, such as expanding manufacturing facilities to increase production capacities, creating personalized treatments, and forming partnerships with healthcare professionals to conduct clinical research and development. Manufacturers are focusing on strengthening their regional presence by offering specialized products such as nasal sprays and eye drops to treat allergies. According to FactMr, this targeted approach is anticipated to significantly boost their revenue, potentially resulting in a 1.5X increase within the next five years. The international allergy care market is characterized by high fragmentation and intense competition, primarily due to the presence of numerous domestic and regional players. Some notable players in the market include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), GSK plc (LON:GSK), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), and AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). Furthermore, startups such as Third Harmonic Bio Inc (NASDAQ:THRD), Connect Biopharma Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ:CNTB), and GentiBio are also actively investing in the research and development of drugs to treat allergic diseases.Our MethodologyIn order to shortlist the cities with the best living conditions for individuals with allergies, we consulted the 2023 Allergy Capitals report published by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), based in Arlington, Virginia. The AAFA conducted a comprehensive assessment of the 100 most populated cities in the United States. Their ranking criteria included spring and fall season pollen scores, the usage of over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medications, and the availability of allergy specialists in each city. The average score from this survey was 71.49, serving as a benchmark for comparison. Cities scoring below this average were considered to offer better living conditions for allergy sufferers. Our list is organized in descending order, starting with cities that received higher scores and gradually moving towards those with lower scores, indicating the most favourable circumstances for individuals with allergies. To further enhance our ranking criteria, we also incorporated data from the Air Quality Index (AQI) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Air quality plays a significant role in allergies, as poor air quality can exacerbate symptoms and trigger asthma attacks. Outdoor air pollution contains various allergens, including pollen, dust, and mould spores, as well as irritants like smog and smoke, which can worsen allergy symptoms. It's important to note that while these cities may have lower allergen levels compared to others, allergies can still be a concern for some individuals.Best US Cities for People With AllergiesPhoto by Michael Bowman on Unsplash25 Best US Cities for People With Allergies25.

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.The unprecedented collections recovery in plasma volumes, the performance of hemostasis management and vascular closure and operational excellence toward greater productivity fueled Haemonetics’ strong performance throughout fiscal 2023.Segments in DetailAt Plasma, revenues of $131.2 million (accounting for 43.1% of the total revenues) rose 29.8% year over year (up 31.2% on an organic basis) in the reported quarter.Revenues at Blood Center (22.1%) fell 8.1% (down 3.7% on an organic basis) to $67.2 million.Hospital revenues (33.1%) rose 17.6% (up 19.3% on an organic basis) to $100.8 million. primarily driven by growth in Vascular Closure and Hemostasis Management.Service revenues (1.7%) increased 2.9% (up 6.8% on an organic basis) to $5.2 million.MarginsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company-adjusted gross margin was 51.8%, down 180 basis points (bps) year over year. The primary drivers of the decrease were inflationary pressures on global manufacturing and the supply chain, increased depreciation expenses and foreign exchange partially offset by volume and price benefits.Story continuesCompany-adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were $103.6 million, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by performance-based compensations, investments in sales and marketing and R&amp;D, partially offset by a decrease in freight costs and Operational Excellence Program savings.The company-adjusted operating income was $53.9 million in the quarter under discussion, up 15.8% year over year. The adjusted operating margin was 17.7%, up 10 bps from the year-ago quarter.Financial PositionHaemonetics exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $284.5 million compared with $259.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.29.Our TakeHaemonetics ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The robust volume growth and price benefits in the Plasma business drove the quarter’s top line.Revenues from HAE’s hospital business came in at $100 million for the first time, which is highly appreciated. The Vascular Closure business favorably contributing toward operating margins also seems promising.For fiscal 2023, Haemonetics generated $26 million in gross savings from its operational excellence program, with cumulative gross savings slightly ahead of the plan. The company continues to prioritize investments in high-impact and high-value projects, with plans to amplify the domestic production of NexSys PCS devices to support plasma customer growth requirements.However, the year-over-year decline to flat revenue guidance in HAE’s Blood Center business is discouraging. The pacing of revenues in this business is backend loaded with an unfavorable order timing impact in the first half of the year compared with fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksHaemonetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Overall, Stryker's business is quite stable: It makes medical equipment, medical instruments, and surgical robotics for healthcare systems worldwide, and there isn't much in the way of rapidly shifting demand for its major segments.​​​​ But it can reliably generate growth by investing in research and development (R&amp;D) to make incremental improvements to its existing products, even if that growth is unlikely to be rapid due to the slow-growing nature of its markets. For example, developing more-advanced hip replacement products for use with its surgical robot system probably won't make investors rich overnight, but it'll keep the top and bottom lines expanding.Continue reading]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now.Value stocks were clear winners in 2022. As inflation spiked and the Federal Reserve started to boost interest rates, investors fled risky stocks with huge valuations and favored cheap value stocks with realistic multiples. Come 2023, the economic realities that caused a panic in the market remain intact. That’s why major analysts are still recommending piling into value playsAccording to Wall Street Journal, investment firm GMO expects growth stocks to fall further while the firm believes value stocks remain discounted.The report added that about 21% of GMO’s $4.3 billion portfolio was invested in hedge funds seeking to profit from the fall in growth stocks.Tech stocks jumped to new highs recently on the back of optimism that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree is nearing its end. Some analysts believe the market is incorporating the possibility of rate cuts. Prudent investors and analysts are rejecting this optimism and warning that the latest rally in stocks might not last.In February, Goldman Sachs analyst’s analyst Lisa Shalett issued a similar warning:""We remain cautious about the direction of the equities market this year, as these other assets do not confirm the optimistic outlook implied by stocks’ performance. Equity investors are sending prices and valuation multiples higher, with little consideration for broader implications. The likely impacts of tightening monetary policy, corporate earnings vulnerability and uncertainty around the path of inflation are additional reasons for prudence.""In January 2023, Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer gave a bullish outlook for value stocks and said that tech valuations were inflated despite massive declines in share prices, According to the analyst,“As big cap technology sees further margin pressure, commodity prices rise and real interest rates remain higher, we think this trend has further to go.”Story continues""Priced for Perfection""Similarly, Bob Doll, Crossmark Global Investments CIO, recently said in a program on CNBC that the market is priced for “perfection.” The analyst said that economic indicators “haunt” him as he believes the possibility of a soft landing is thin. Doll said last year’s market decline was mostly due to “valuation compression” while this year’s declines will be because of “earnings problems” and “recession.” Answering a question about the possible options for investors in this environment, Doll recommended diversification and said he’s underweight tech. He thinks many tech stocks have been “lagging and struggling.” Doll recommended investors to own value stocks that are not just cheap but has some “current momentum.”Value has “returned with a vengeance,” to quote a JPMorgan’s report, which said that while growth stocks have outperformed value stocks for a long time in the past, the future outlook for value plays look strong. Here’s what the report said:“Value’s potential for future returns remains great. Valuation spreads between Value and Growth are still extreme, and higher than those at the peak of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) bubble. The proportion of equity assets invested with a Value investment style is also very low, meaning flows could provide a significant tailwind.”In this backdrop, it’s a good idea to take a look at stocks that have attractive value multiples, strong profits and  fundamentals.Most Profitable Value Stocks NowOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used a stock screener to find stocks with PE ratios of less than 15 as of April 27 and positive revenue growth. From this list, we picked stocks that have the highest net income (TTM) and the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) in March declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 1.32 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.81%.14. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21French energy giant TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) is one of the most profitable value plays. During the first quarter, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)’s adjusted EPS came in at $2.61, in line with estimates. Over the past 12 months, the company’s net income stands at over $20.5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE).ClearBridge International Value Strategy made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection in the energy sector was also a strong driver of returns, benefiting from an improving global macro outlook. Prospects for a milder recession, increased demand from China reopening from its COVID-19 restrictions, and the recognition that the market hasn’t discounted oil company valuations based on commodity prices all served to benefit energy company stock prices. Holdings such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), a leading French oil, and natural gas company, was a recipient of these macro tailwinds. We are constructive on the long-term prospects of the energy sector, with it being the second largest relative overweight in the portfolio. We believe that as the market becomes more comfortable with the industry’s intermediate earnings and capital discipline from producers, our high-quality companies in the sector should continue to perform.”13.

(NYSE:NRG), significantly higher than 27 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The biggest stakeholder of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management which owns a $266 million stake in the company.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it.

Significantly, the Company began to rally in the last days of the quarter after it preannounced production at the low end of the guidance for the first quarter when market fears were for an even worse outcome.  Given March weather, particularly in the northern United States, where a significant snow pack continued to cover farmland (as of the first days of April), I expect their 1stquarter earnings call will speak to significant second-quarter demand, particularly as the weather was more favorable for fertilizer usage in early April. Prices during the second week of April for fertilizers broadly also have begun to lessen their decline despite a continued rapid decline in other feedstock commodities.The stock has been driven by concern about destroyed 2023 demand that I believe, given the state of the world’s depleted fields, issues that demand can no longer be destroyed, only delayed, and even that may not be necessary given the rapid improvement of the US’s northern grain basket and the solid fundamentals in Brazil.  The Company continues to trade for a very cheap valuation even though it generates strong free cash flow, returns that cash flow to shareholders, and is under levered. We continue to hold our position.”8.

The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7. United Rentals, Inc.

(NYSE:WMB) Delivered A Weaker ROE Than Its Industry",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-nyse-wmb-122443669.html,1683980683,STORY,['WMB'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Williams Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Williams Companies is:19% = US$2.7b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.Does Williams Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Williams Companies has a lower ROE than the average (33%) in the Oil and Gas industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Williams Companies visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Williams Companies' Debt And Its 19% Return On EquityWilliams Companies does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.70. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President David Calhoun bought US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$202. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 26.29k shares for US$4.2m. But insiders sold 412.00 shares worth US$84k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Boeing insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Boeing Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Boeing. In total, insider Howard McKenzie sold US$84k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Boeing Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.06% of Boeing shares, worth about US$73m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Boeing stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. In contrast, they appear keener if you look at the last twelve months. We like that insiders own a fair amount of the company. So we're happy enough to look past some selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Boeing has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Icahn is seeking to replace the company's Chairman, CEO, and longest-tenured director with a three-member slate that is relatively homogenous. All three are investment professionals who work or worked for Icahn for years…the dissident nominees are, as Icahn representatives, largely interchangeable.""""If the dissident's campaign had contained fewer unsubstantiated accusations, or if the dissident had nominated candidates with direct industry expertise, it might have been easier to conclude that the case for change was strong enough to support more dissident nominees.""""In consideration of the lack of evidence of malfeasance by the CEO, and the fact that the dissident does not have a CEO candidate in hand…removal of CEO deSouza from the board seems excessively disruptive at this stage.""Illumina is pleased that ISS recognizes the strength of Illumina's Board and supports its best-in-class governance practices. ISS's recommendation that shareholders reject two of Icahn's associates is recognition that Illumina has the right skill sets and experiences on its Board to advance the company's strategic goals for value creation.Illumina recommends that shareholders vote FOR all of its nine nominees. Illumina Board Chair John Thompson and his deep experience have provided invaluable insight and leadership to the Illumina Board and he has led high-growth companies for more than four decades. As Chair of the Microsoft Board, Thompson oversaw a period of unprecedented innovation and shareholder value creation and led the Board team responsible for selecting Satya Nadella to be Microsoft's CEO. During his tenure as director, chair and lead independent director from February 2012 to present, Microsoft's total shareholder return (TSR) of 885% outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 683%. At Symantec, where he was CEO for 10 years, he grew revenue from $600 million to $6 billion and delivered a TSR of 819%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by 856%. As CEO at Symantec from 1999 through 2009, Thompson was ranked as one of The Best-Performing CEOs in the World, according to Harvard Business Review in 2010.Story continuesRegarding Icahn, it is relevant for Illumina shareholders to be fully aware that Icahn's own firm, Icahn Enterprises (IEP), recently disclosed that it is being investigated by federal authorities.

The completion of hot functional testing marks a significant step towards operations and providing customers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60 to 80 years. Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.""The energy and enthusiasm at the Vogtle site, and across our entire company, is high with Unit 3 in the final stages of startup testing and Unit 4 making progress towards safely loading fuel,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""The team at Unit 4 has been able to take lessons learned from Unit 3 and apply them. That has allowed us to safely complete hot functional testing on Unit 4 in significantly less time than we did for Unit 3. It's incredible that these new units will provide our state with zero-emissions energy for the next 60 to 80 years, and that's thanks to the dedication of the teams at the site to getting these units built, and built right.""During hot functional testing, plant systems achieved normal operating pressure and temperature, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, to demonstrate the systems will operate on an integrated basis as designed. Now, the site team focuses on completing the remaining work necessary to submit documentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that all inspection, tests and analyses have been performed and all acceptance criteria, collectively known as ITAACS, have been met on Vogtle Unit 4 as required by Southern Nuclear's Combined Operating License. Each ITAAC closure notice must be verified by the NRC before fuel can be loaded into the reactor.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero emissions, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.Story continuesAbout Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE:SO), America's premier energy company.

125,a5aa2d75-a2d0-3e34-adda-354dd806ea00,TEL,2023-05-13,Be Sure To Check Out TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-te-connectivity-ltd-120309130.html,1683979389,STORY,['TEL'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase TE Connectivity's shares on or after the 18th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.59 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.36 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, TE Connectivity stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $120.46. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. TE Connectivity paid out a comfortable 34% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether TE Connectivity generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 37% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's positive to see that TE Connectivity's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see TE Connectivity earnings per share are up 9.2% per annum over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, TE Connectivity has increased its dividend at approximately 11% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpHas TE Connectivity got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and TE Connectivity is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and TE Connectivity is halfway there. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.While it's tempting to invest in TE Connectivity for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 1 warning sign for TE Connectivity and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China and Europe markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, the total net revenue CAGR is expected to be 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, the company believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeAlthough lululemon reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter results, management’s commentary on elevated inventory levels at the end of the quarter hurt investors’ sentiment. lululemon’s inventory grew 49.8% to $1,447.4 million at the end of fiscal 2022. This included a $62.9-million provision against the inventory related to lululemon Studio, which reduced the inventory growth rate by seven percentage points.The company noted that the off-season made up for about 45% of its inventory. In fiscal 2023, management expects inventory growth to moderate, while maintaining its full-price selling model and remaining well-positioned to fulfill guest demand. lululemon expects the inventory growth rate at the end of the fiscal first quarter to increase 30-35% from the last year. It also expects inventory growth to be in line with sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks to consider are Crocs Inc.

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Pfizer: A dividend powerhouse with strong financial health scorePharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a household name, but did you know it’s also a dividend powerhouse? The company’s payout stands at a fantastic 4.3%, and it has raised its dividend annually for the last dozen years in a row. Its InvestingPro financial health score is solid at 3.61, largely thanks to robust profits and a nice cash flow that should keep those dividends coming. Shares are down some 27% for the year to $37.34, and analysts expect a rise of more than 35% from here. So it may be time for investors of all kinds - but especially dividend investors - to swoop in and pick up some Pfizer.Robert Half International's share buybacksStaffing name Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI) pays a solid 2.9% dividend yield, and has upped its payout for the past 19 straight years — which certainly gives its dividend investors peace of mind. Not only is its dividend high, but it has also been returning cash to shareholders by aggressively buying back shares. Its profits and cash flow are both exceptional, giving it a very nice 3.06 InvestingPro financial health score, and analysts figure it has more than 30% upside from current levels. Shares are down 9.1% for the year to $66.87.Aflac's financial health supported by price momentum and cash flowAflac (NYSE:AFL), the insurance giant, has a proven track record of 39 consecutive years of dividend bumps, earning it the coveted title of ""dividend aristocrat."" It also sports a generous dividend payout of 2.5%, and Wall Street analysts price targets put stock upside at an impressive 15%. Aflac's respectable InvestingPro financial health score, moreover, is 2.83 thanks to its exceptional price momentum and strong cash flow. Shares have slipped some 8% year to date to $66.10.Story continuesRegions Financial's potential 30% upsideRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) has raised its dividend payout annually for the past decade, and the current dividend payout of 5.1% is particularly impressive. The bank boasts a robust financial health score of 2.94, largely thanks to its lofty profits — and, per both fair value estimates and analyst projections, the stock is undervalued and could see a surge of at least 30%. Shares are down 27% for the year to $15.74, offering a chance to get in at a great price.Texas Instruments: Growth and dividends in the same stockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has ratcheted up its dividend payout for 19 years in a row, and this reliable payout is a juicy 3%, adding to the company's appeal. On top of that, the chipmaker’s InvestingPro fair value gives the stock significant upside, and the company boasts a solid InvestingPro financial health score of 2.89, in large part due to its mouth-watering profits and strong cash flow. Shares are nearly breakeven for the year at $161.Related ArticlesPro Exclusive: 5 dividend dazzlers to fuel your income streamProcter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"

I am Lydia Logan, IBM's Vice President for Global Education and Workforce Development. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the state of skills development in the United States, the role of employers in providing new skilling opportunities toward career advancement, and the role of government in supporting employer-led programs.In my role at IBM, I create more effective education and workforce programs by leading our community and university skills initiatives. These programs help fulfill IBM's pledge to skill 30 million people worldwide by 2030. Today, I will share IBM's experience leading skills development programs and our perspective about the need for multiple pathways to careers - especially in the technology sector. I will also share some policy recommendations that can holistically expand and scale proven efforts nationwide.Despite economic uncertainties, the current unemployment rate remains historically low. The U.S. is experiencing a massive skills shortage across industries and employers are competing for workers with the right mix of skills and competencies for available positions. According to a recent report, 77% of employers face difficulties finding qualified talent - a 17 year high.1 At the same time, enrollment at traditional higher education institutions continues to decline. And employers estimate 44% of workers' skills will be disrupted or changed in the next five years, according to a World Economic Forum report.2To help solve these workforce challenges, targeted skills development programs with on-the-job experience play a vital role. These programs help ensure workers and job seekers obtain the in-demand skills employers seek and ensure longevity in fulfilling careers.Story continuesIn our experience and research, IBM has found that time and money are two of the greatest barriers for workers as well as businesses looking to create new skills programs. According to a recent study we commissioned with Morning Consult, 60% of students, people seeking new jobs, and people seeking to change careers worry that online learning or obtaining digital credentials may be costly to obtain.3 As a global technology leader, we believe the U.S. must rethink its education and workforce development approach to meet today's market needs in order to create good-paying jobs and opportunities for more Americans.To help close the skills gap, we offer a range of education, skills, and career readiness programs to U.S. students and job seekers at no cost. Our programs help Americans get on the path to technology careers by reskilling people in early or mid-career job roles via our registered apprenticeship program or through collaborative partnerships with nonprofit organizations, education systems, and skilling programs. Employee lifelong learning and development have been a hallmark of IBM's culture since graduating its first class of sales professionals in 1916. Today, we continue to invest in learning and development programs.Our employees are expected to complete a minimum of 40 hours of professional development annually to continuously build their skills and remain competitive in today's marketplace. Our employees exceed that mark: In 2022, IBMers completed an average of 88 hours or 22 million learning hours collectively. As a result, 9 out of 10 IBMers now have skills of the future, compared to 3 out of 10 when we started this initiative more than 5 years ago. Credentials, including digital badges, that provide a measure of learning progress and skills acquisition are a vital part of IBM's robust education and professional development strategy. These credentials provide employees a portable means of carrying their learning achievements along their career journeys.Nonetheless, we also recognize that more needs to be done and done at scale to ensure our country can remain competitive globally.Expanding Career PathwaysSeveral years ago, IBM coined the term ""new collar"" jobs to describe in-demand, well paying jobs that did not require degrees because for these roles a candidate's skills matter more. Further, a focus on new collar jobs creates opportunities for new sources of talent with diverse backgrounds and skill sets previously excluded by the lack of a college degree. We speak from experience: rewriting job descriptions and removing the four-year degree requirement in more than half of IBM job openings in the U.S. resulted in more diverse applicants - including a 63% increase in underrepresented applicants - and almost 20% of our U.S. hires joining without a degree.To further the point: 62% of Americans 25 years of age or older do not have a bachelor's degree, and traditional four-year degree requirements exacerbate inequality in the workforce, which results in around 79% of Hispanic and 72% of Black applicants being ruled out from consideration for roles with traditional degree requirements. A national skills first - as opposed to degree first - policy would help bridge the gap between job openings and qualified applicants.IBM Apprenticeship ProgramThe IBM Apprenticeship program is another way IBM is expanding pathways to meaningful careers in technology. We started our first-of-its-kind technology apprenticeship in 2017, and in its first year it grew nearly twice as fast as expected. Today, we have more than 30 different apprenticeship job roles, from cybersecurity to AI to digital design.Furthermore, IBM's technology apprenticeship programs allow people to earn and learn at the same time - participants do not have to choose between education and career. Our apprenticeship programs earned official recognition from the American Council on Education (ACE) for more than 40 college credits, which is approximately 80% of the credits needed toward an associate degree, with no cost for the apprentices. To cite one example, our Application Developer role recently was evaluated by ACE for a recommended 51 credit hours. We are currently working with community colleges to seamlessly transfer these credits and add complementary courses that would lead to an associate degree for the apprentices.We know this work-based learning model works because it's positively impacting people's lives4. As Adrianna - an IBM apprentice graduate who now serves as the IBM Recruitment Professional shared, ""My life truly changed overnight. I went from putting out fires all hours of the day and night, to being able to actually enjoy a vacation with my family knowing that my team had my back. That's time well spent with my daughter, and thanks to IBM, I can do that!""5IBM Z Mainframe Apprenticeship Program/Franklin Apprenticeship PartnershipAnother example of how IBM is providing non-traditional pathways for Americans to enter the workforce is through our IBM Z Mainframe Employer Apprenticeship Program. IBM is working with over 30 Fortune 100 companies - and mainframe clients - to recruit and prepare ZSystem mainframe administrators for our clients that hire them into Registered Apprenticeship roles.Currently, 67% of Fortune 100 companies use the IBM Z mainframe infrastructure but find it challenging to identify talent with the right skills to maintain and innovate on the platform. The IBM Z platform is critical to large-scale enterprise success - delivering core services for cloud and hybrid cloud environments and supporting mission-critical financial services transactions. IBM partnered with Franklin Apprenticeship to offer our IBM Z platform clients a solution to getting the talent they need and providing a rewarding career to capable, committed individuals without a technology degree or prior experience. To date, our mainframe clients - banks, large retailers, automakers - have hired close to 200 apprentices across the country. The validity of this program is demonstrated by the fact that our clients are coming back to us for additional talent.IBM SkillsBuildAs part of our commitment to skill 30 million people worldwide by 2030, particularly in underrepresented communities, we offer the cost-free IBM SkillsBuild education program to high school and university students, educators, and adult learners. IBM SkillsBuild enables learners to develop valuable new STEM and workplace skills and access career opportunities through customized, practical learning experiences.IBM SkillsBuild offers over 1,000 courses in up to 20 languages, with the opportunity to earn IBM-branded digital credentials recognized by the market on such topics as cybersecurity, data analysis, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and professional skills. The customized, curated learning experiences include work-based learning projects, direct conversations with IBM's experts and mentors, and connections to career opportunities. The online version at skillsbuild.org is open to anyone and is flexible in meeting individual learning needs for place, pace, and path. Additionally, we offer an enhanced version of the program through partner organizations.More specifically, these partnerships provide specialized support to learners during their journey, including connecting to career opportunities. For example, in 2022, IBM announced a partnership with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs6 and now offers enhanced resources through IBM SkillsBuild for transitioning service members in need of skills to pursue high-demand technology roles. Our partnership with the VA also serves as an enhancement and support for the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) program. As part of this partnership, we also provide IBM experts to support U.S. veterans throughout their job application process. Additionally, one of our partners, CompTIA is engaging with multiple state workforce boards, to explore partnerships for the A+ and IBM SkillsBuild cobranded opportunities.IBM Digital Credentials help democratize education and boost employability, especially for individuals without college degrees, by providing a way to demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in specific areas of technology. In today's rapidly changing job market, traditional college degrees are increasingly financially unattainable for most of the adult working population. Digital Credentials offer an alternative, cost-effective approach to workforce development, and provide incremental skills development options to populations in need of upskilling and reskilling.Bria, an IBM Apprentice graduate was encouraged by her community college instructor to take IBM SkillsBuild courses and learn new skills for an IT career. Now she works as a consultant at the IBM Client Innovation Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She loves her new tech career, and her future is bright. As Bria shared in a recent blog post, ""I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me. In the next five years, I hope to see myself still working in the tech field and at IBM. Having worked on projects that made a difference for people. Being a mentor to others like me to help them see their potential.""7Policy recommendationsOur nation's education and workforce systems are not equipped to meet the market demands of the modern, digital economy. And there is no silver bullet to fix that. Instead, we suggest employers, policymakers, education providers, and other stakeholders act collectively to make the most significant impact to help current and future workers.To that end, IBM recently launched the Skills First Coalition - an advocacy group comprised of businesses and innovative education providers - to advance policies that align education and workforce development with jobs that are in-demand and growing to expand career opportunities for millions of Americans.8 The coalition has a broad membership of employers representing different industries - retail, advanced manufacturing, and technology, to name a few. Still, we all have one thing in common - we all need workers with the right mix of fundamental, durable, and technical skills. As a result, our member companies are committed to delivering innovative workforce development programs to broaden talent pools while engaging in advocacy to make the public workforce system easier to navigate for employers.As this Committee explores ways to modernize the workforce development system and coordinate programs more efficiently across government agencies, we offer the following recommendations:Align higher education and workforce development laws to focus on skills attainment. The need for skills-based education is on the rise and higher education is not keeping pace. It's critical our federal higher education and workforce laws work together to provide the necessary resources to attain indemand skills. We encourage Congress not only to update federal laws, but innovate across the federal landscape and break down programmatic silos.Dedicate Individual Accounts (ITAs) for workforce development. We know that work-based learning works. IBM advises Congress to remove barriers limiting skills attainment within WIOA, including dedicating funding towards Individual Training Accounts, increasing dollar limits on incumbent worker programs, and enhancing work-based learning programs. We encourage Congress to invest in work-based learning opportunities, including earn-whileyou-learn programs, apprenticeships, and internships initiatives.Reform the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL). More effectively and directly connect the ETPL to the needs of employers with in-demand and growing jobs, ensure flexibility by allowing online and hybrid workforce development programs, and focus on quality and outcome measures. Also, Congress should ensure employers on the ETPL can provide upskilling and reskilling, especially for pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeships, and other on-the-job opportunities.Increase transparency and reviews of outcomes. A recent report9 from Harvard University's the Project on Workforce showed job-seekers do not have access to complete information to help guide their decision to pursue skills development programs. A vital part of this is the availability of the quality and transparency of outcomes data on critical program measures such as completion and employment rates, credential attainment, and earnings. As such, improved access to quality data will lead to more transparency and help move the system toward high-quality, affordable skilling opportunities aligned with the needs of regional, state, and local employers.Relatedly, we also believe Congress can encourage the development and coordination of an open, interoperable data infrastructure - rooted in strong privacy and security measures - to support increased transparency and provide insights to learners, employers, and job seekers. Coupled with federal convening and coordination, states should also continue to integrate high quality labor market data tools to better connect learners with education and employment opportunities.We know this work can be done in a way that unlocks opportunities for all Americans, but it's going to require us - industry, government, education institutions and other community stakeholders - to shift the way we approach education, skills development, and hiring. We have an unprecedented opportunity before us to transform our education and workforce systems to uplift more Americans and enrich their lives and our society.

145,40766b8f-7799-3b88-a90f-5c69bb5bdd75,MPC,2023-05-13,This is How to Play the Refining & Marketing Industry Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/play-refining-marketing-industry-now-124512536.html,1683895512,STORY,"['PBF', 'MPC', '^GSPC', 'MUSA', 'VLO']","[With gasoline prices falling across the country, there are some concerns in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry. Weighed down by shrinking margins, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings in the remainder of 2023. Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistant inflation continues to eat into profits. Nevertheless, the space continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Valero Energy VLO, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSoftening Margin Backdrop: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will drive down profitability further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.     Fuel Demand Remains Healthy: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Ongoing Supply-Chain Bottlenecks: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of some 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has inched up 1.2% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.4%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 1.34X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.17X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.78X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.30X, with a median of 4.31X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Stocks to Watch ForMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA’s acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 30 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 2.2%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 11.5% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Price and Consensus: MUSA Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $47.4 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 14.8% in a year.Price and Consensus: MPC PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF’s daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%. The Zacks #3 Ranked PBF’s shares are up 16% in a year.Price and Consensus: PBF Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.VLO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.7%. Valued at around $40.1 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Valero Energy has lost 11.3% in a year.Price and Consensus: VLO Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, General Motors Company is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that GM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TSLA has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.96, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 47.85. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.50. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 11.17.Based on these metrics and many more, GM holds a Value grade of A, while TSLA has a Value grade of C.Story continuesGM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $60.94 indicates a potential upside of 35.2%.The mean estimate comprises 18 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $13.26. While the lowest estimate of $35 indicates a 22.4% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 79.7% to reach $81. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for UAL, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for UALHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in UALThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10.7%, as eight estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, UAL currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much UAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Alaska Air Group (ALK). ALK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.48. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.66. ALK's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.07 and as low as 6.35, with a median of 8.51, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that ALK has a P/B ratio of 1.49. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. ALK's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.83. ALK's P/B has been as high as 1.78 and as low as 1.27, with a median of 1.49, over the past year.If you're looking for another solid Transportation - Airline value stock, take a look at United Airlines (UAL). UAL is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of United Airlines are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 4.79 and a PEG ratio of 0.10 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 8.66 and 0.27, respectively.Story continuesOver the last 12 months, UAL's P/E has been as high as 23.59, as low as 4.51, with a median of 7.55, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.11, as low as 0.10, with a median of 0.11.Additionally, United Airlines has a P/B ratio of 2.24 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 3.83. For UAL, this valuation metric has been as high as 4.36, as low as 1.76, with a median of 2.81 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Alaska Air Group and United Airlines's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ALK and UAL is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

156,b5156e68-2ecf-370a-a235-a68a96b87a83,UAL,2023-05-13,"Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/copa-holdings-cpa-hit-52-131501839.html,1683897301,STORY,"['CPA', 'UAL']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Copa Holdings (CPA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 19.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $107.19 in the previous session. Copa Holdings has gained 27.1% since the start of the year compared to the 3.6% move for the Zacks Transportation sector and the 6.1% return for the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 10, 2023, Copa Holdings reported EPS of $3.99 versus consensus estimate of $3.34 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.36%.For the current fiscal year, Copa Holdings is expected to post earnings of $12.26 per share on $3.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 48.43% change in EPS on a 13.55% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.66 per share on $3.48 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.22% and 3.24%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCopa Holdings may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Copa Holdings has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 8.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 9.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 6.9X versus its peer group's average of 8.2X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Copa Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Copa Holdings fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Copa Holdings shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does CPA Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of CPA have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL). UAL has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. United Airlines Holdings Inc beat our consensus estimate by 13.70%, and for the current fiscal year, UAL is expected to post earnings of $9.07 per share on revenue of $53.03 billion.Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc have gained 7.4% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 4.97X and a P/CF of 4.28X.The Transportation - Airline industry is in the top 15% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CPA and UAL, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

157,2e2ba295-b413-32a6-a88c-2e134e31572f,UAL,2023-05-13,Pilots at United picket for higher pay as pressure builds before summer travel season,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-pilots-picket-airline-unions-130505954.html,1683896705,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[DALLAS (AP) — Just ahead of what could be a record-breaking summer travel season, pilots from one of the nation’s biggest airlines marched in picket lines at major airports on Friday as they push for higher pay.The United Airlines pilots have been working without a raise for more than four years while negotiating with airline management over a new contract.The pilots are unlikely to strike anytime soon, however. Federal law makes it very difficult for unions to conduct strikes in the airline industry, and the last walkout at a U.S. carrier was more than a decade ago.The coast-to-coast protests by United pilots come on the heels of overwhelming strike-authorization votes by pilots at American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. United pilots could be the next to vote, according to union officials.Pilots at all three carriers are looking to match or beat the deal that Delta Air Lines reached with its pilots earlier this year, which raised pay rates by 34% over four years.Top scale at United for a captain is $369 an hour on two-aisle planes, called “widebodies,” which are generally used on international flights, and $297 an hour on “narrowbodies” such as Boeing 737s. Airline pilots fly an average of 75 hours per month, according to the Labor Department.United has proposed to match the Delta increase, but that might not be enough for a deal.“We still have a long ways to go to resolve some of the issues at the table,” said Garth Thompson, chair of the United wing of the Air Line Pilots Association.Thompson said discussion about wages has been held up while the two sides negotiate over scheduling, including the union's wish to limit United's ability to make pilots work on their days off.United spokesman Joshua Freed said, “We're continuing to work with the Air Line Pilots Association on the industry-leading deal we have put on the table for our world-class pilots.”Pilots argue that United should reward them for helping the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.Story continues“We made quite a few sacrifices during the pandemic, and we feel it is now time for the company to step up to the plate and to give us a contract, acknowledging the sacrifices and the contributions that we have made,” said pilot Arzu Delp, as he picketed at San Francisco International Airport.The Delta contract that United pilots are using as their starting point will cost Delta $7.2 billion over four years. All airlines are dealing with rising labor costs, which could show up in the price of a ticket, but fares are also set by supply and demand, notes Blaise Waguespack, who teaches airline management and marketing at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.Giselle Ascione, a United passenger in San Francisco, said the airlines are making a lot of money, and “the pilots as well as the attendants should be paid. It’s common sense.”Even if the airlines and their unions fail to reach agreements quickly, strikes are unlikely in the next few months — when millions of Americans hope to fly over summer vacation. Under U.S. law, airline and railroad workers can’t legally strike, and companies can't lock them out, until federal mediators determine that further negotiations are pointless.The National Mediation Board rarely declares a dead end to bargaining, and even if it does, there is a no-strikes “cooling-off” period during which the White House and Congress can block a walkout. That's what President Bill Clinton did minutes after pilots began striking against American in 1997. In December, President Joe Biden signed a bill that Congress passed to impose contract terms on freight railroad workers, ending a strike threat.The last strike at a U.S. carrier occurred at Spirit Airlines in 2010.Thompson, the union leader at United, said his pilots “will continue to work in 2023” despite challenges including an “aggressive” summer flight schedule.Over the years, airline workers have conducted job actions that fell short of a strike but disrupted flights anyway. A federal judge fined the American Airlines pilots’ union $45 million for a 1999 sickout that crippled the airline’s operations, although the amount was later reduced. In 2019, a federal judge ordered unions representing American's aircraft mechanics to stop what the airline termed an illegal work slowdown.Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University, said Congress would not permit an airline strike because of the economic harm it would cause, but unhappy pilots could still cause disruptions in other ways.“They always have ‘work to rule.’ They could say, ‘We’re not working any overtime,'” Wheaton said. “I don't anticipate the pilots trying to screw up travel for everybody intentionally, but bargaining is about leverage and power ... having the ability to do that can be a negotiating tactic.”Airlines are vulnerable to work-to-rule protests because they depend on finding pilots and flight attendants to pick up extra shifts during peak travel periods.Regardless of the legal hurdles to a walkout, unions believe that strike votes give them leverage during bargaining, and they have become more common. A shortage of pilots is also putting those unions in particularly strong bargaining position.Chicago-based United has roughly 14,000 pilots, and the union expects at least 2,000 will picket Friday at 10 airports from Newark, New Jersey, to Los Angeles. The union is also distributing leaflets that highlight the pilots' desire for better work-life balance in their scheduling but make no mention of pay.___Haven Daley in San Francisco contributed to this report.]"
158,9aad9a32-793d-3dcc-991f-0647bc04f3e2,TGT,2023-05-13,Retail Earnings Looming: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-earnings-looming-expect-193707098.html,1683920227,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'AMZN']","[Walmart WMT shares have tracked the broader market year-to-date, with Target TGT shares modestly on the weaker side. But since the onset of the regional banking uncertainty following the Silicon Valley Bank failure in early March, Walmart shares have been notable outperformers, up +4.9% in that period vs. an +0.8% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index and an -8.3% decline for Target shares.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart and Target shares vs. the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress.’Walmart and Target are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Walmart will report on Thursday, May 18th, and Target will report on Wednesday, May 17th, with both quarterly reports coming before the market’s open. Walmart’s quarterly EPS expectations coming into this report have been very stable, with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 per share up by a penny over the past two months and unchanged over the past month. Unlike Walmart, there has been some pressure on Target estimates, with several analysts pointing to near-term challenges for the company.One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart’s bigger grocery business, which gives its results greater stability given the ‘staply’ nature of that otherwise low-margin business. That said, groceries drive foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned ‘trade down’ phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Analysts see relatively greater momentum in Walmart’s business on the back of higher average selling prices, foot traffic, gains on the e-commerce side, and better margin results relative to what they reported last time on February 21st. Target is seen as suffering from weak traffic during the period, with the price trend only marginally positive.Story continuesBoth companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic went into the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results, for which they were punished by the market. While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job of adjusting to the new environment compared to Target.With respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 20 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s standard industry classification.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 20 Zacks Retail companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 20 retailers that have reported are up +11% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 70% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings and revenue expectations.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne recurring theme in the Q1 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution. Given this development, one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q1, and that’s what these results will reconfirm.Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Friday, May 10th, we now have Q1 earnings from 459 S&amp;P 500 members, or 91.8% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -4% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, with 77.6% beating EPS estimates and 74.9% beating revenue estimates.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.7%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 300 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&amp;P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Walmart and Target reports, this week’s docket includes Home Depot, TJX Cos, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, and Deere &amp; Company.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 459 index members in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the 459 index members that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -4.1% on +4.3% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.We get to down earnings on positive revenues when margins are squeezed. That’s what we have been witnessing in the ongoing earnings season, which is in line with the trend we have been seeing for some time now. In fact, 2023 Q1 is the 5th quarter in a row of declining margins.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchActual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne notable recent development on the earnings front, which I flagged in the weekly Earnings Trends report in greater detail, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&amp;P 500 earnings have increased +0.3% as a whole and +0.6%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Analyzing Recent Earnings Estimate Revisions  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ISRG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned +15.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.8% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.46 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.34 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ISRG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $7.11 billion and $8.06 billion estimates indicate +14.3% and +13.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.86 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 23, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.86 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.84 Zacks Consensus Estimate, BJ's Wholesale Club has an Earnings ESP of 2.5%.BJ is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Royal Caribbean (RCL) as well.Royal Caribbean is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 27, 2023.

To be sure, the nuances behind bank bailouts are complex. Still, at the root, these lifelines tend to be inflationary. Basically, that money has to come from somewhere.Further, if the Federal Reserve somehow manages to consistently curb accelerating consumer prices, it may then face another problem: preventing the economy from completely imploding. A lot of good work can be thrown into the trash if monetary policy sparks a severe downturn. Therefore, thinking ahead with inflation hedge stocks may be prudent. Finally, the AP recently warned that the banking crisis isn’t over yet. Moving forward, the question may be how bad will circumstances get before an eventual recovery? Without clear and confident answers, investors may want to load up on these inflation-beating stocks.COSTCostco$499.06KRKroger$49.15DDominion Energy$56.50ROSTRoss Stores$104.83NEMNewmont Corporation$48.29BGBunge$90.21PSXPhillips 66$93.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCostco (COST)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockWhile it certainly doesn’t rank as the most exciting name among inflation-resistant stocks, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) forwards a business that screams mitigation of accelerating prices. As an open-warehouse-style retailer, Costco encourages bulk purchases. Should prices rise, this action basically facilitates economies of scale. Of course, the buying in bulk bit only works for durable or long-shelf-life goods that you’ll use no matter what.Financially, Costco benefits from carrying a stable balance sheet. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio pings at 1.5, above 72.33% of sector rivals. Also, its debt-to-equity ratio comes in at 0.4, favorably below the sector median stat of 0.71. Operationally, Costco’s three-year revenue growth rate of 14% outflanks 83.45% of the field. Also, its book growth rate during the aforementioned period comes out to a healthy 10.4%.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg COST as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target lands at $540.10, implying over 8% upside potential. Again, it’s boring but it gets the job done as one of the inflation hedge stocks.Kroger (KR)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockFrankly, the underlying business of supermarket operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) sells itself regarding inflation-resistant stocks. Basically, no matter how dire circumstances become in the economy, people need to eat. Further, they can trade down other luxury purchases, such as going out to dinner at fancy restaurants. But you cannot trade down from the minimum calorie intake. That’s the cynical narrative of KR stock.Compellingly, Kroger also presents a fundamental discount to astute investors. Right now, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 11. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 80% of companies listed in the retail defensive industry. Operationally, Kroger’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 10.3%, outpacing 74.3% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.7%, above 62.59% of sector players.Lastly, covering analysts peg KR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $53.82, implying over 9% upside potential. While not exciting, it’s a shoo-in for inflation-beating stocks.Dominion Energy (D)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWith utilities like Dominion Energy (NYSE:D), they inherently rank among inflation-proof investments. When you get down to it, Dominion and its ilk enjoy what’s known as a natural monopoly. Basically, nothing legal prevents competitors from taking on Dominion. However, because of the steep barrier to entry, enterprises simply don’t even bother. Still, D stock has been wobbly this year, losing more than 10% of equity value.Nevertheless, from a longer-term perspective, Dominion intrigues contrarians. For example, the market prices D stock at a forward multiple of 14.3. As a discount to projected earnings, Dominion ranks better than 64.89% of its peers. Also, the company posts a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.2%, above 60.14% of sector players. And its operating margin over the trailing year impresses at 23.95%. That’s above 77.9% of the field.To close out, analysts peg D as a hold but with a price target of $61.82. This estimate implies over 9% upside potential. It’s not the prettiest idea but it’s a relevant contender for inflation-resistant stocks.Ross Stores (ROST)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An American chain of discount department stores, Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) might be a risky idea for inflation protection stocks. Nevertheless, forward-thinking investors might be able to see some significant gains here. Essentially, with society normalizing, more companies have begun recalling their workers. Therefore, folks need to upgrade their wardrobe. Ross Stores facilitates just that but at a cheaper cost.While shares slipped about 10% since the start of the year, in the past 365 days, they’re up almost 9%. Financially, one of Ross Stores’ top attributes stems from its balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.86, implying high fiscal stability and low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, Ross features a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.8%, ranked better than 62% of the retail cyclical industry. Also, its book growth rate pings at 9.9% during the aforementioned period.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ROST as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $126.36, implying 21% upside potential.Newmont (NEM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comWhile people can argue about the viability of the economy, the hard fact is that gold performed well this year. And that’s strange because the Fed hasn’t exactly relaxed its monetary tightening program. With fewer dollars chasing after more goods, this backdrop should be deflationary for gold. It’s not, which makes Newmont (NYSE:NEM) an intriguing idea for inflation-resistant stocks.Another factor that bolster NEM is the underlying copper business. Good economy or bad, society consumers untold amounts of copper. Therefore, even under the weight of accelerating prices, NEM makes a case for inflation-beating stocks. Financially, Newmont could use some work if I’m being honest. For example, its balance sheet is only moderately stable based on the numbers. Further, its revenue growth is a bit below average while its net margin slipped into negative territory. For those willing to look beyond the Covid-19 impact, analysts peg NEM as a strong buy. Their average price target hits $58.92, implying 21% upside potential.Bunge (BG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAn agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) offers a natural arena for inflation-resistant stocks. As stated with Kroger, people must eat. It doesn’t matter what’s going on with the economy or how advanced technology becomes. However, Bunge disclosed mixed results for its latest earnings report. Therefore, BG remains challenged so far this year, with shares stumbling over 5% since the January opener.Nevertheless, the red ink may tempt those seeking inflation hedge stocks. In particular, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 7.79. As a discount to projected earnings, Bunge ranks better than nearly 87% of companies listed in the consumer packaged goods industry. As well, its priced at 0.21-times trailing sales, below 89.62% of its peers. On the balance sheet, the company offers decent metrics. For example, its Altman Z-Score pings at 4.2, indicating solid stability and low bankruptcy risk.Lastly, analysts peg BG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $118.60, implying 31% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA downstream energy giant, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) mostly focuses on the retail and refining aspect of the energy value chain. In other words, if you’re pumping gasoline into your car, you’re dealing with a downstream player. Fundamentally, Phillips 66 benefits from a captive audience. For the majority of American households, making the transition to electrification isn’t financially feasible. Therefore, PSX makes a cynical case for inflation-resistant stocks.Further, PSX may be one of the discounted inflation-beating stocks. Right now, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 3.61. As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 76.97% of companies in the oil and gas industry. Also, it trades at 5.15-times free cash flow, ranked better than 63.59% of its peers. Operationally, the company enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9%, above 63.29% of sector players. As well, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 39.3%. On a final note, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy.

(NASDAQ:ADI) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 88%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110107190.html,1683975667,STORY,['ADI'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Analog Devices' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Analog Devices. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Analog Devices. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Analog Devices' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Analog Devices. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.0% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Analog Devices, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$321m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Analog Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Analog Devices , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

The company’s payout stands at a fantastic 4.3%, and it has raised its dividend annually for the last dozen years in a row.

NWSA witnessed a decline in revenues across all its segments except Book Publishing and Dow Jones.Shares of this diversified media and information services company have lost 6.2% in the past one year against the industry’s gain of 1.5%.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNews Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNews Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | News Corporation QuoteQuarterly DetailsNews Corporation delivered adjusted quarterly earnings of 9 cents a share. The bottom-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents but plunged 43.7% from adjusted earnings of 16 cents reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable period.Total revenues of $2,447 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,398 million but dipped 2% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was primarily due to a $98 million or 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment due to continued challenging housing market conditions in the United States and Australia. The downside was partially offset by higher Dow Jones segment revenues, which includes the acquisitions of OPIS and Chemical Market Analytics and higher revenues at the News Media and Subscription Video Services segments on a constant currency basis. Adjusted Revenues were flat year over year.Total EBITDA decreased 11% to $320 million, primarily due to lower revenues, higher costs at the Dow Jones segment and a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The results also include $7 million of costs related to the professional fees incurred by the Special Committee and the company in connection with evaluating the proposal from the Murdoch Family Trust as well as the fees related to the potential sale of Move. Adjusted total segment EBITDA decreased 15%.Story continuesSegment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment declined 13% to $363 million, induced by a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues decreased 10%.Revenues in Move fell 17% to $141 million primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 79% of total Move revenues, decreased 23% to $33 million. The decline was due to the continued impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, including higher household interest rates, which has led to lower lead and transaction volumes. The referral model generated 23% of total Move revenues in the quarter compared with 28% in the prior year. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites declined 24% year over year to 72 million. Lead volume declined 30%.Revenues at REA Group decreased 10% to $222 million because of a $13 million or 6% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, lower Australian residential revenues and lower financial services revenues. Australian national residential buy listing volumes declined 12% year over year, with listings in Sydney and Melbourne down 20% and 18%, respectively.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $477 million, down 3% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 5%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE were driven by a rise in both volume and pricing, partially offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented approximately 26% of total circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 20% in the prior year.Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were more than 4.5 million, reflecting a 6% increase from the prior year, primarily due to the growth in streaming subscribers driven by BINGE and Kayo. Broadcast subscriber churn improved to 12.3% from 14.3% in the prior year. Broadcast average revenue per user for the quarter increased 2% year over year to A$84 (US$57).Revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 9% year over year to $529 million. This includes $27 million and $19 million contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted Revenues at the Dow Jones segment were flat from the prior year. Digital revenues at Dow Jones represented 79% of total revenues compared with 76% in the prior year.Circulation and subscription revenues increased 13% to $49 million, which includes the contributions from the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA. Circulation revenues declined 1%, primarily due to lower print volume and lower revenues from IBD, which was partially offset by the continued growth in digital-only subscriptions. Professional information business revenues grew 38%, primarily driven by the acquisitions of OPIS and CMA and growth in Risk &amp; Compliance products. Revenues from the Risk &amp; Compliance products grew 16%, which includes a 3% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 69% of circulation revenues  compared with 68% in the prior year.Advertising revenues decreased 14% to $14 million, primarily due to 17% and 8% declines in digital and print advertising revenues, respectively. The decline was due to a continued weakness in the technology and finance categories. Digital advertising accounted for 59% of total advertising revenues compared with 62% in the prior year.During the third quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached more than 5.1 million, up 6% from the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions rose 10%. Total subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 5% to nearly 3.9 million average subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal grew 9% to 3.3 million average subscriptions and represented 85% of total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $515 million, flat year over year from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level, mainly due to higher sales in Christian books. Adjusted Revenues increased 2%. Digital sales declined 3% from the prior year due to lower e-book sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Consumer revenues and were in line with the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 60% of total revenues in the quarter.Segment EBITDA for the quarter decreased 9% to $6 million, due to the ongoing supply chain, inventory and inflationary pressures on manufacturing, freight and distribution costs. The decline was partially offset by lower employee costs. These pressures are expected to continue to impact the business in the near term. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 7%.Revenues in the News Media segment dipped 3% to $563 million. Within the segment, revenues at News Corporation Australia and News UK decreased 5% and 4%, respectively, as both were impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, revenues at News Corporation Australia and News UK increased 1% and 6%, respectively. Adjusted Revenues for the segment increased 4%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 4% due to lower print volumes and an 8% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 5% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 7% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group.Digital revenues represented 36% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter compared with 35% in the prior year and represented 34% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. As of Mar 31, 2023, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including the Times Literary Supplement, were 494,000 compared with 421,000 in the prior year.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 points to a change of -9.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 indicates a change of +0.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.8%. The $135.08 billion and $137.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fueled by the rise of ChatGPT and the subsequent race for AI supremacy, all the Big Tech gang are looking to get a piece of the action.There’s no danger of the opportunity being overhyped, according to Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann. In fact, the 5-star analyst knows exactly which company is best positioned to benefit the most from this huge development.“We see Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) driving the biggest technology inflection the world may have ever seen in transformational AI everywhere and in everything,” Mosesmann said. “CEO Jensen Huang’s AI vision is openly playing out coincident with what appears to be Intel’s structural secular decline, signaling a changing of the guard in silicon valley for generational semiconductor global leadership.”Mosesmann’s comments come ahead of the chip giant’s first quarter of fiscal 2024 report (April quarter), which the company will deliver on May 24. Mosesmann expects the company will meet or deliver slightly better results than those anticipated by the Street – consensus has revenue hitting $6.5 billion, and so does the company +/- 2%. The Street is calling for non-GAAP GMs (gross margins) of 66.5%, above Nvidia’s guide for ~65.3% +/- 50 bps.The analyst highlights the data center Hopper H100 ramp, “solid Gaming trends (Ada Lovelace), and stable networking” as reasons behind the optimistic forecast.Looking ahead to the July quarter, Mosesmann expects Nvidia’s top-line guide to come in at ~$7.10 billion, just ahead of the Street at $7.09 billion. That said, at the other end of the spectrum, Mosesmann is looking for non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 – a little below the $1.06 consensus estimate.All told, there’s no change to Mosesmann’s Buy rating or $320 price target. There’s potential upside of 13.5% from current levels. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where, in total, 38 analysts have thrown the hat in with NVDA reviews over the past 3 months. These break down into 30 Buys, 7 Holds and 1 Sell, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, considering the shares have soared by 93% year-to-date, the $288.24 average target implies a modest 2% upside.

(NYSE:CMI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Cummins' shares before the 18th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.57 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.28 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Cummins has a trailing yield of approximately 2.9% on its current stock price of $217.25. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Cummins paid out a comfortable 35% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 68% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Cummins has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Cummins has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineIs Cummins worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Cummins paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Cummins looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while Cummins has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Cummins that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Cummins in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Cummins (CMI) is an Auto-Tires-Trucks stock that has seen a price change of -10.46% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.57 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.89%. In comparison, the Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry's yield is 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.76%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6.28 is up 4% from last year. In the past five-year period, Cummins has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.81%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Cummins's current payout ratio is 35%. This means it paid out 35% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.CMI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $19.65 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 29.96%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that CMI is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Marshall, however, will report to Mark Lazarus, the chairman of NBCUniversal television and streaming, rather than to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, to whom Yaccarino most recently reported.The new organizational structure expands Lazarus’ influence within the company at a time when it is without a dedicated CEO (Jeff Shell was terminated by NBCU last month, with Cavanagh assuming oversight while keeping his job at Comcast).Yaccarino had been expected to lead NBCUniversal’s upfront presentation at Radio City Music Hall Monday morning, and a spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter Thursday night that she could not be reached for comment because she was in “back to back rehearsals” for the event.

He tweeted Thursday that he had hired a new CEO who would start this summer, though he did not name her in his tweet.Musk was interviewed by Yaccarino at an advertising industry event last month, and last week Twitter announced a new 2024 Olympics content deal with NBCU.However, Twitter’s revenue has collapsed since the takeover, with many advertisers spooked about brand safety on the platform, and with Musk so far unsuccessfully pursuing a more aggressive subscription strategy.It will now fall on Yaccarino to figure out how Twitter moves forward with its business.“We are grateful for Linda Yaccarino’s leadership of NBCUniversal’s Advertising Sales business, and for the innovative team and platform she has built,” Cavanagh added in a statement. “Linda has made countless contributions to the company during her twelve year tenure, and we wish her the best.”]"

He said Yaccarino's role will be focused mainly on running the company's business operations, leaving him to focus on product design and new technology.Here's what to know about Yaccarino.VETERAN AD EXECYaccarino, 60, has worked as an advertising executive for decades. She came to NBCUniversal in 2011, just as Comcast was completing its merger with NBC, and oversaw integrating the companies' ad sales platforms. There, her most recent title was chairman, advertising and client partnerships. She oversaw all market strategy and advertising revenue, which totaled nearly $10 billion, for NBCUniversal’s entire portfolio of broadcast, cable and digital assets.Before that, she held a variety of roles at Turner Broadcasting System Inc. from 1996 to 2011, including executive vice president and chief operating officer. That was after she held management positions at several media sales outlets.“She’s a marketer’s leader,” said Mark DiMassimo, founder and creative chief of ad agency DiGo.“She speaks CMO and she understands what marketers need,"" he added, referring to the role of chief marketing officer.PUSHING BOUNDARIESYaccarino has pushed the ad industry for change on several fronts, including advocating for relying less heavily on Nielsen ratings for measurement, and introducing a digital platform called One Platform that makes it easier to buy ads across a variety of different media in an effort to better compete for ads against social media companies and traditional media companies.“It’s worth noting that they built out a big team that’s made a lot of innovative products and supported the growth that they’ve experienced,” said Brian Wieser of strategic advisory firm Madison and Wall. “They’ve been pushing the industry on a lot of fronts, you know, trying to make it better.”Story continues“I think that first and foremost, she’ll bring to Twitter an understanding of what advertisers need to see to get back on the platform from the brand safety perspective,” said Dave Campanelli, chief investment officer of media buying firm Horizon Media. “She knows better than anyone what it’s going to take and I think for advertisers and buyers, the question really is, is she going to have free rein to do all that or is it going to be just the same old, same old (with Musk).”BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILSYaccarino serves as chairman of the World Economic Forum’s Taskforce on the Future of Work. A 1985 graduate of Pennsylvania State University, she lives in Sea Cliff, New York, with her husband, Claude Madrazo. They have two children, Christian and Matthew.]"

NBCUniversal announced on Friday (May 12) Linda Yaccarino will be leaving her role as chairman of global advertising and partnerships, amid multiple reports that she is in advanced negotiations to succeed Elon Musk as Twitter CEO.Musk first announced he had found his replacement as CEO late Thursday (May 11). His tweet did not identify the person, but indicated “she will be starting in ~6 weeks!” Musk also confirmed that he would stay on as chief technical officer and executive chairman, as well as continuing to play a central role in the site’s development.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesYaccarino confirmed her departure from NBC in a prepared statement: “It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team. We’ve transformed our company and the entire industry—and I am so proud of what we’ve accomplished together.”Who is Linda Yaccarino?Yaccarino is a veteran of the advertising industry, having served as Turner’s executive vice president of advertising sales, marketing, and acquisitions before joining NBC. In her profile on NBC’s website, which has been taken offline since the announcement of her departure, Yaccarino was credited with developing NBC’s ad-supported streaming platforms and generating more than $100 billion in advertising sales.She is also active on Twitter, which she first joined in 2012. Her bio on the social media platform reads that she is “inspired by provocative leadership,” something that will likely be a positive given Musk’s divisive tenure as Twitter’s head.Her exit marks another high-level departure from the network. Last month, Jeff Shell— NBCUniversal’s former CEO—stepped down following a probe into an inappropriate relationship with a colleague.Twitter’s communications department was not available for comment on any potential hiring of a new CEO.Story continuesBy the digits: Musk’s tenure as CEO56%: Estimated decline in Twitter’s value since Musk took over, according to reports from March6,300: Number of employees Musk has laid off from the company since November, a cut of roughly 80% of employees28%: Estimated decline in Twitter’s ad revenue in 2023, or a drop from $4.1 billion to $2.98 billion25,800: Number of tweets Musk has posted from his account so far, including 13 tweets in the past dayMusk steps down five months after losing a Twitter pollMusk initially promised he would find a replacement CEO after losing a poll that asked if he should step down from the role in December. More than 17.5 million voted, with 57.5% saying he give up the position.Now, despite his impending departure, Musk is expected to continue exerting influence on Twitter. He has confirmed he will still oversee product and software development as well as systems operations. It is also possible Musk wants to have someone else run the site while he works on plans to turn Twitter into an “everything app.”Musk also remains the CEO of Tesla, which has seen declining profits amid broad price cuts for the fleet of electric vehicles, likely spurred by increased competition in the industry.The auto manufacturing company has also faced criticism about its autopilot system, a toxic work environment, and Musk’s divided attention with Twitter, including a letter from shareholders that accused Musk of operating “above the law.” Tesla shares rose on the news that Musk found someone else to take Twitter’s helm.Related stories:🙃 Elon Musk makes it sound like being Twitter CEO is the worst job in the world💡 Who should be Twitter’s next CEO?

(AP) — A Delaware judge has ruled in favor of Oracle founder Larry Ellison in a shareholder lawsuit alleging that he coerced the technology company’s board into paying a grossly inflated price to acquire software company NetSuite Corp. in 2016.Vice Chancellor Samuel Glasscock III on Friday rejected the plaintiffs’ allegation that Oracle’s acquisition was not entitled to the deference traditionally shown corporate decision-makers under Delaware’s “business judgment” rule.The shareholders argued that the $9.3 billion deal should be subjected to a more rigorous “entire fairness” review because Ellison was both a controlling shareholder of Oracle at the time and owned almost 40% of shares in NetSuite, which he cofounded in 1998. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle overpaid for NetSuite by $3 billion.While noting that Ellison was “a force” at Oracle and a face of the company, Glasscock said Ellison was not a controlling shareholder and did not try to influence the board’s decision to acquire NetSuite. Ellison withdrew from Oracle’s consideration of the NetSuite acquisition just before the initial presentation to the Oracle board, and the remaining directors set up a special committee to conduct negotiations, the judge noted.“This is adequate to cleanse Ellison’s conflict as a director and officer standing on both sides of the transaction,” Glasscock wrote.Glasscock also acknowledged that, while it’s possible for minority stockholders to exercise control of “the corporate machinery” for their own benefit, such a scenario did not apply to Ellison, who is not a majority shareholder of Oracle.“The evidence demonstrates that he did not control Oracle, and that he absented himself from the acquisition of NetSuite,” the judge wrote. “Moreover, the directors appointed a special committee, and I find that body well-functioning and independent of Ellison.”Glasscock also rejected the shareholders’ allegations that Ellison and Oracle CEO Safra Catz breached duties of loyalty by misinforming the special committee and concealing material facts regarding the acquisition.Ellison co-founded NetSuite with Evan Goldberg, a former Oracle employee, in 1998. Both Oracle and NetSuite sell software that allows businesses to automate and manage business processes such as accounting, risk management and supply chain operations.]"

Ellison owned 47% of the company at the time of the $9.3 billion deal and held about 28% of Oracle’s shares.Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III said in a decision Friday that Ellison withdrew from Oracle’s consideration of the acquisition just before an initial presentation to the board and that “the remaining directors empowered a special committee to conduct the negotiation of any acquisition of NetSuite.”The lawsuit by the Firemen’s Retirement System of St. Louis accused Ellison and Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz of orchestrating the combination when NetSuite’s sales were slowing because of increased competition from Oracle.Read the court’s opinion here“Today’s decision constitutes a complete vindication of Mr. Ellison and Ms. Catz, each of whom has been subject to these baseless claims for seven years — notwithstanding their consistent and uncompromising devotion to Oracle and its stockholders throughout their storied tenures with the company,” Peter Wald, an attorney for Ellison and Catz, said in a statement.A representative of the plaintiffs didn’t respond to requests for comment on the decision.Glasscock said that as a “force at Oracle” and “the main creative party and a face of the company,” Ellison could have attempted to influence the board’s decision, but didn’t.Story continues“The concept that an individual — without voting control of an entity, who does not generally control the entity, and who absents himself from a conflicted transaction — is subject to entire fairness review as a fiduciary solely because he is a respected figure with a potential to assert influence over the directors, is not Delaware law, as I understand it,” Glasscock wrote.The case is In Re Oracle Corp.

The scholarships will be distributed to 980 students, ages 16-26, eager to ignite powerful change within their community and beyond. This year, the Taco Bell Foundation is giving $2.5 million to Taco Bell restaurant team members and $7.6 million to Taco Bell fans nationwide. Award amounts range from $5,000-$25,000 per recipient.The Live Más Scholarship is a passion-based scholarship that gives students the tools and resources to boldly pursue their educational dreams. To qualify for the scholarship, applicants must submit a two-minute video describing their passion, a positive change they want to make in the world, and how their education will help them achieve that goal.This year, the Taco Bell Foundation received its highest number of scholarship applications - nearly 14,000. Recipients include more than 300 fans of the brand, 150 Taco Bell restaurant team members, and over 500 renewal recipients through the Taco Bell Foundation's renewal application, allowing applicants to renew their scholarships up to three times.Scholarships awarded to Taco Bell fans are funded 100% by customers who participate in the Taco Bell Foundation's Round Up fundraiser by rounding up to the nearest dollar, proving change can change lives. While team member scholarships are funded completely by donations from Taco Bell Corp. and Taco Bell Franchisees.""The Live Más Scholarship is more than a check. It provides a community for these young scholars where they can learn from one another and grow outside of the classroom,"" said Jennifer Bradbury, Executive Director of the Taco Bell Foundation. ""The Live Más Scholarship opens a door of connections, opportunities, and programs to help students flourish in their passions.""Check out the stories of two 2023 Live Más Scholars who will be using their scholarships to create a better world for us all:Story continuesKing A.: King is a passionate animator who is currently studying Art and Business Marketing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).

King is a Taco Bell team member and learned about his scholarship during a surprise party at the Taco Bell where he works and where his dad is the Restaurant General Manager.Stacy E.: Born deaf in a Spanish-speaking household, Stacy quickly learned the challenges that come with language barriers. Over time and with the proper resources, Stacy learned American Sign Language and fell in love with Deaf Education. Stacy, now working on her Associate of Arts, is planning to continue her education at Stephen F. Austin State University to pursue a degree in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Studies.

Last month, the partnership expanded to approximately 160 locations across the Louisville-Lexington Kentucky region.To achieve success, Tattersfield said the team needs to ensure freshness, delivery times, and packaging. ""Someone that is coming through in a drive-thru that’s looking for a coffee is probably going to do an individual serve...we really focus on dozens,"" Tattersfield said, making the point of sale a bit different. All in all, Tattersfield said it has been a ""pretty rigorous process.""""You can actually make the doughnuts fresh and then have a route system so you can drop them off, and so when we tested with McDonald’s in the latter part of last year in the 9-store test, we could see that the rigor and the quality matched,"" he said.In a note to clients, JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe said, ""We view the optionality embedded within the company’s U.S. delivery fresh daily (DFD) segment’s 'profitable growth potential' favorably.""McDonald's is engaging in its own “demand planning"" Ivankoe said, meaning once the doughnuts leave the Krispy Kreme facility, McDonald's owns the product. Based on this, JPM predicts ""potential up to approximately 40% margin to Krispy Kreme from each store although the probability of a national rollout is still ambitious.""Krispy Kreme Doughnut and McDonald's Drive-Thru (Source: Getty images)If the partnership were to go national though, Ivankoe detailed the upside:Story continues""McDonald's is a 13,446 store business in the U.S. and if Krispy Kreme was even 2% of the brand's U.S. sales, this would translate to approximately $500 million of wholesale sales at Krispy Kreme assuming a 50% margin and relative to the entire $1 billion-plus segment revenue reported by Krispy Kreme in the US for Fiscal year 2022.""Year-to-date shares of Krispy Kreme are up nearly 50%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500, up 5%.

(AP) — McDonald’s and a franchise holder are at fault after a hot Chicken McNugget from a Happy Meal fell on a little girl's leg and caused second-degree burns, a jury in South Florida found in a case reminiscent of the famous hot coffee lawsuit of the 1990s.A second jury will determine how much McDonald's USA and its franchise owner, Upchurch Foods, will pay the child and her mother, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.Thursday's decision was split, with jurors finding the franchise holder liable for negligence and failure to warn customers about the risk of hot food, and McDonald’s USA liable for failing to provide instructions for safe handling of the food. McDonald's USA was not found to be negligent, and the jury dismissed the argument that the product was defective.“Our sympathies go out to this family for what occurred in this unfortunate incident, as we hold customer safety as one of our highest priorities,"" McDonald’s owner-operator Brent Upchurch said in a statement. “We are deeply disappointed with today’s verdict because the facts show that our restaurant in Tamarac, Florida did indeed follow those protocols when cooking and serving this Happy Meal.”Jurors heard two days of testimony and arguments about the 2019 episode that left the 4-year-old girl with a burned upper thigh.Philana Holmes testified that she bought Happy Meals for her son and then-4-year-old daughter at a drive-thru window at a McDonald's in Tamarac, near Fort Lauderdale, the SunSentinel reported. She handed the food to her children, who were in the back seat.After she drove away, her daughter started screaming. The mother testified she didn't know what was wrong until she pulled over to help the girl, Olivia Caraballo, who is now 7, the newspaper reported. She saw the burn on the girl's leg and took photos on her iPhone, which included audio clips of the child's screams.The sound of the girl's screams were played in court. The child, who is autistic, did not testify, the newspaper reported.Story continuesLawyers for McDonald’s noted that the food had to be hot to avoid salmonella poisoning, and that the nuggets were not meant to be pressed between a seat belt and human flesh for more than two minutes.The girl's parents sued, saying that McDonald's and the franchise owner failed to adequately train employees, failed to warn customers about the “dangerous” temperature of the food, and for cooking the food to a much higher temperature than necessary.While both sides agreed the nugget caused the burns, the family's lawyers argued the temperature was above 200 degrees (93 Celsius), while the defense said it was no more than 160 degrees (71 Celsius).The case is likely to stoke memories of the McDonald's coffee lawsuit of the 1990s, which became an urban legend of sorts about seemingly frivolous lawsuits, even though a jury and judge had found it anything but.A New Mexico jury awarded Stella Liebeck, 81, $2.7 million in punitive damages after she was scalded in 1992 by hot coffee from McDonald’s that spilled onto her lap, burning her legs, groin and buttocks, as she tried to steady the cup with her legs while prying the lid off to add cream outside a drive-thru.She suffered third-degree burns and spent more than a week in the hospital.She had initially asked McDonald’s for $20,000 to cover hospital expenses, but the company went to trial. A judge later reduced the $2.7 million award to $480,000, which he said was appropriate for the “]"

Year to date, the Dow — the biggest gainer of 2022 — is up marginally by 0.5%.The broad-market benchmark — S&amp;P 500 Index — has advanced 7.6%. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has rallied 17.8%, buoyed by a lower inflation rate and the Fed’s decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hike. However, in the past month, Wall Street remained rangebound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that pay regular dividend to strengthen one’s portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five dividend -paying growth stocks that have solid upside left for 2023.

For more cities, head on over to 5 Fastest-Growing Cities in the Southeast. The Southeastern region of the United States, as defined by the Geological Survey, is made up of eleven states in the continental United States, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. It is one of the oldest regions in America, with the first signs of human presence in the area dating back to tens of thousands of years. Additionally, the Southeastern states were also a crucial part of the Civil War in the 19th century, with the bulk of these deciding to break away from America.Since then, the Southeast has significantly changed and is a global leader in industrial production and manufacturing. In fact, one of the most famous facilities in the world is located in the Southwestern state of Florida. Florida is from where humans launched rockets to the Moon, and it is the only region in the world with the honor. Courtesy of its proximity to the equator, Florida makes for the perfect site to launch rockets from as they can capitalize on the Earth's rotation around its axis and follow the equator to gain an additional 'oomph' to their speed during launch. The launch site is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Kennedy Space Center - and it still plays a crucial part in the American space program by being the only launch site in the country that is capable of supporting crewed missions. The KSC is also NASA's only rocket launch site in the country, with other facilities belonging to the Space Force.However, the space center is not the only crucial NASA facility in the region. Another highly important site in the Southwest is the Stennis Test Center. Stennis is located in Hancock County, Mississippi, and it is responsible for producing some of the most breathtaking visuals in America. This is due to the fact Stennis is the only site in America that can withstand the unimaginable forces generated by a rocket engine. Like KSC, Stennis is also a historic site since it was built to test the massive F-1 engines for the Saturn V rocket.Story continuesYet, as if sending people to the Moon and blasting some of the most powerful rocket engines made in human history was not enough, the Southeast is also busy leading America in other high technology areas. For instance, the second largest research park in the world, the Cummings Research Park, is in the Southeastern state of Alabama. Cummings has more than three hundred companies, and these include high end space and aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin, Dynetics, and Teledyne. Additionally, the Southeast is also home to Florida State University. The university has the only high end magnetic laboratory in America, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab). This facility has several programs which range from spectroscopy to electromagnetic resonance, researching quantum physics, and high magnetic field experiments and research.Not only is the second largest research triangle in the Southeast, but the biggest triangle - namely the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina which covers seven thousand acres - is also in the region. The RTP, like Cummings, has more than three hundred companies, which include some of the largest and most advanced firms on the planet. This list includes the pharmaceutical giant GSK and the networking equipment manufacturer Cisco. Other firms in the area include agriculture technology companies, medical device firms, and biotechnology companies.The region is also home to some of the biggest companies in the world. These include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). These are just a handful of firms in the area, and most of these are in Atlanta - one of the Southeast's largest and most prosperous cities. Atlanta is the capital of Georgia and has one of the biggest gross domestic products (GDPs) in the world and in the U.S. There are more than a thousand multinational firms in the area, and the city's economy is dominated by information technology and broadcasting markets. Another prosperous Southeastern city is Miami - the second largest city in Florida in terms of population. Miami has some of the busiest sea and air ports in America, and its location also makes it a hub of the cruise ship industry in the U.S.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the fastest-growing cities in the Southeast.20 Fastest-Growing Cities in the Southeastrayna-tuero-AbTcdSQ3v2E-unsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the fastest growing cities in the Southeast, we first narrowed down the 30 largest cities in the region in terms of population.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 four days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 16, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.29 a share.Star Bulk Carriers' Earnings ESP sits at 20.83%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.29 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.24.SBLK is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is United Parcel Service (UPS).United Parcel Service is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 25, 2023. UPS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.53 a share 74 days from its next earnings release.United Parcel Service's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.65% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SBLK and UPS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(UPS) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-united-parcel-inc-130001570.html,1683896401,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned -10.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has lost 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.49 per share, indicating a change of -24.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16.3%. This estimate has changed -6.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 indicates a change of +5.2% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $23 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.1%. The $96.45 billion and $99.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.9% and +2.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NetApp (NTAP), which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This data storage company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7.51%.For the most recent quarter, NetApp was expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, but it reported $1.37 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.58%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.34 per share, while it actually produced $1.48 per share, a surprise of 10.45%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor NetApp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.NetApp has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 31, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The stock has declined 5.8% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why TXT Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of TXT shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.24. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering TXT in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, TXT currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The NTSB said preliminary information indicates the train received an alarm ""from a wayside defect detector, or hot bearing detector, several miles before the train derailed.""The devices are used to detect the temperature of wheel bearings on rail cars. Norfolk Southern did not immediately comment.The NTSB said in the East Palestine derailment a wayside defect detector transmitted a critical audible alarm message instructing the crew to slow and stop the train to inspect a hot axle.Some experts have said the derailment in East Palestine may have been averted if detectors had been placed closer together. That derailment and the subsequent fire sent a cloud of smoke with billowing black plumes over the town of East Palestine,outraging thousands of residentswho were forced to evacuate.Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee passed bipartisan sweeping rail safety reform legislation.Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell noted that hours after passage ""another train derailed likely due to a bad wheel bearing. This could have been prevented had the commonsense reforms in our bill been in place.... It’s time for Congress to get on board to improve rail safety.""The legislation would require hotbox detectors be deployed an average of every 15 miles, a reduction of the current voluntary practice of installing defect detectors an average of every 25 miles today.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday he looks forward to bringing the rail measure to the Senate floor ""as soon as possible.""

Alan Shaw, Norfolk Southern CEO, joins me now. Alan, good to see you. I know this was a long time in the making. Appreciate you joining us.ALAN SHAW: Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity. We were scheduled to get together in February. I really wanted to be here, but I needed to be in East Palestine. So thanks for your flexibility.- Of course. We appreciate that. So I think a lot of questions from investors and regarding where the state of the company is. But first and foremost, why are these derailments happening? Another one this week. Why are investors seeing this?ALAN SHAW: I think it's important to note that rail is the safest, most sustainable, and most efficient form of transporting goods across land. We can do better, right? And last year in Norfolk Southern, our number of derailments was the lowest in two decades. We can do better.We're looking at this stuff. We're working very closely with the NTSB. And you see me on the Hill advocating with Democrats and Republicans for additional safety measures.And you look at just the East Palestine derailment. It's going to require an industry response. And here's why. The NS crew is doing exactly what they're supposed to do. There were no track defects. The wayside detectors were working.And the NTSB is looking at a rail car that no railroad owns and touched three railroads before it got to Norfolk Southern. So it's going to require an industry-wide response. I understand my role there. And I'm embracing that role and taking an industry-leading position in advancing safety in rail.Story continues- So is it an equipment thing? Is it the trains you are running? Is it a process thing? Why does this continue to happen?ALAN SHAW: What we saw in East Palestine is the NTSB is looking at a catastrophic failure on a wheel bearing on a car that is owned by one of our customers.- What is the presence on the ground now for you in East Palestine?ALAN SHAW: We've got 300 people, NS employees and contractors, who are there, seven days of work, working on the environmental remediation, working on community assistance, and helping to invest in the community, to help it thrive. And I really appreciate what they're doing.Here's what I see, Brian. When they come home and take some time off, they want to get back up to East Palestine. And I've heard reports of people cutting vacations short.And that tells me two things. That tells me the NS team knows that they're having a positive impact on the community. And that tells me the community has given our team a lot of positive reinforcement.I was there in the immediate aftermath. I've been there almost every week since. And I'm taking it as an opportunity to sit down with the community, find out what we're doing well and what we can do better to help the community thrive and monitor our work.- How long do you plan to be there?ALAN SHAW: We're going to be there as long as it takes. We're not going to be bounded by time or money. Each and every day, we're going to do the next right thing. And I'm going to see this thing through, no matter how long it takes or no matter what happens.- I think one of the questions is-- and it's not just a Norfolk Southern thing, it is the railroad industry that has moved to precision railroading. And that is something that I came in contact with by Hunter Harrison, legendary railroad figure. Now, this is something you guys have adopted. Are we committed to staying that route, given the concerns about longer trains and speeds?ALAN SHAW: Brian, I became CEO about a year ago. And in my first year as CEO of Norfolk Southern, I was really proud to announce a new strategy and chart a new course within the industry. There are some components of PSR that we're going to continue to endorse. And that's developing our people, working safely, investing in our assets.We are now focused on long-term growth. And we have got a vision for doing the right things over the long term for our customers, our employees, the communities we serve, and our shareholders. Since I became CEO about a year ago, we've been on a hiring spree, which is different from what you've seen in the past in the rail industry. And right now, the number of employees at Norfolk Southern is 1,500 higher than it was a year ago. And our pipeline of conductor trainees is amongst the highest on record.And I can do that because of the confidence I've got and the strength of our powerful franchise, the customers we serve, and the markets we serve. We're focused on long-term growth.- Is PSR still viable for the industry?ALAN SHAW: Norfolk Southern has a different strategy. We charted a new course. And we're going to deliver on it.And it was working. Our customers saw it. You look at our service levels in December and in January, they were the highest they've been in a couple of years. And our volumes were outperforming normal seasonality.- So it's a hybrid system?ALAN SHAW: Yes, yeah.- And what does that mean? Do you run shorter trains than competitors? How does it work?ALAN SHAW: We invest in resiliency, right? We take a long-term view of things. And there are a lot of secular trends that were accelerated by the pandemic that really support growth on Norfolk Southern. We see a lot of onshoring. And we see forward positioning of inventory next to the ultimate consumer, right? We see more manufacturing in the United States.And when you look at our franchise-- and this is why I'm so confident in what we're doing-- we serve 60% of the consumption in the United States. We serve more than half the manufacturing. We serve more than half of all US vehicle production. Every day, we ship 8,000 vehicles.And we serve more than half of the energy consumption in the United States. So that gives us the confidence to invest in the long term. And we've got, as you know because you've covered this space, the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East that serves the US customer. So we've got a powerful franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the US economy. And I fully intend to leverage that by engaging with our people, hiring people, and investing over the long term.- We recently caught up with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. You mentioned regulators. Take a listen to what he had to say. I would love for you to get a reaction.PETE BUTTIGIEG: Look, we have a lot of concerns about the business models that the railroads have adopted. They strip out the human factor. Employment at some of these major railroads is down 30%, 40%. They've become wildly profitable but have not been able to dramatically improve their efficiency or their fluidity in moving goods.And it's really come on the backs of workers who are now overworked, stressed out. And this is part of what led to so much concern last year as workers were insisting on sick leave, something that we still believe these railroads need to provide. Some of them have negotiated it with some of their unions. But they should all be doing more right now. We're also concerned about railroad safety.- Now, your reaction to that. And Buttigieg, he also advocated for improved braking systems. Do you want to see that?ALAN SHAW: So I've been engaged with the secretary on a number of occasions. We've had a lot of constructive dialogue. And I continue to engage with him. I respect his opinion.There are a lot of things that Norfolk Southern does that are absolutely aligned with the administration's goals-- high-paying union jobs-- I told you the hiring spree that we're on-- investments in the nation's infrastructure, pulling trucks off the highway, and the sustainability advantage of rail relative to truck. So we're aligned on that. Relative to our long-term focus and our pivot away from that traditional rail model and hiring, that's exactly what we're doing, as I talked about in the new strategy Norfolk Southern charted in the industry.And then relative to rail safety, I've been on the Hill a number of times. I'm advocating with Republicans and Democrats for many of the provisions that are included in the rail safety bills.- Is braking part of that one?ALAN SHAW: ECP brakes, I think, is what you're referring to. We tested that. We were one of the first testers of it, about 15 years ago. And we couldn't get it to work reliably for us.- Lastly, real quick, what removes the regulatory overhang on your stock?ALAN SHAW: I think what is important for folks to know is there are a lot of things in these bills that make sense. And they will not create an undue burden on our cost structure or the cost structure of our customers. And as I engage with the Service Transportation Board-- I'm very close to them as well-- what they're really looking for from me and from the rail industry is my ability to execute on that unique strategic plan that we outlined last fall that's going to drive service and drive growth.- All right, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you for doing this. I know this is a very busy time for you and your company. We appreciate the time. Thank you so much. Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw.ALAN SHAW: Brian, my pleasure.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), BP p.l.c. (BP) and Zoetis Inc. (ZTS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares largely tracked the Zacks Tech sector this year, but the stock hasn't looked back since the very strong Q1 earnings release on April 25th. As a result, Microsoft share now up +28.4% this year vs. +22% for the Zacks Tech sector and the +8.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 index.  The company is benefitting from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues increased due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft is also seen as having a better offering on the artificial intelligence (AI) front than rival Alphabet. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. However, More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to weak Windows and Devices businesses.Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. However, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of BP have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+24.4% vs. +10.2%). The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, backing impressive production growth. The company boasted that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key projects was met successfully. Story continuesBP expects $2-$3 billion of divestment and other proceeds in 2023. Before reporting its June-quarter results, the integrated energy major is willing to complete an additional $1.75 billion in share buy-backs. Also, BP reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings resulting from an increase in oil-equivalent production volumes.However, the energy giant’s balance sheet is considerably more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Also, increasing exploration expenses have been affecting the company’s income. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on BP here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Zoetis shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.8%). The company’s innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products maintain momentum for the company.The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth.However, Zoetis had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Although the constraints have eased out, a similar situation will impact growth. Stiff competition from animal health business wings of Merck and Bayer remains a woe.(You can read the full research report on Zoetis here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc.

However, soft housing demand, supply chain risks and dynamic market conditions hurt.Investments, Clean Generation Focus Aid PPL Corporation (PPL)Per the Zacks analyst, PPL's investment of $12 billion through 2026, will strengthen its infrastructure.

Escalating operating costs remain a concern.Solid User Growth &amp; Premium Content Demand Aids Snap (SNAP)Per the Zacks analyst, Snap benefits from an improving user growth driven by strong adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) Lenses and demand for premium Discover content and Shows.Strength in Industrial Segment Aids Graco (GGG), Costs HurtPer the Zacks analyst, solid traction of Graco's Industrial segment, led by robust product portfolio of adhesive equipment should drive its growth. However, high operating costs remain concerning.CNA Financial (CNA) Banks on Solid Premiums Amid High CostsPer the Zacks analyst, CNA Financial is set to grow on solid Specialty, Commercial and International segment, which will drive improvement in net premiums. However, high costs remain a concern.New UpgradesGrowing Customer Base &amp; Partnerships Aid ServiceNow (NOW)Per the Zacks analyst, ServiceNow benefits from rising adoption of its workflows from companies undergoing digital transformation. Also, strategic alliances with the likes of Microsoft are a tailwind.Solid Demand &amp; Brand Strength Drives Crocs' (CROX) Top LinePer the Zacks analyst, Crocs has been gaining from solid consumer demand, as well as strength in the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands. This led to significant revenue growth of 34% in Q1.Copa Holdings (CPA) Benefits From Rosy Passenger TrafficUpbeat air-travel demand is driving Copa Holdings' top line.

Overall, Stryker's business is quite stable: It makes medical equipment, medical instruments, and surgical robotics for healthcare systems worldwide, and there isn't much in the way of rapidly shifting demand for its major segments.​​​​ But it can reliably generate growth by investing in research and development (R&amp;D) to make incremental improvements to its existing products, even if that growth is unlikely to be rapid due to the slow-growing nature of its markets.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Whirlpool's shares before the 18th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.75 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$7.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Whirlpool stock has a trailing yield of around 5.4% on the current share price of $130.59. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Whirlpool paid a dividend last year despite being unprofitable. This might be a one-off event, but it's not a sustainable state of affairs in the long run. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If Whirlpool didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. It paid out more than half (58%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously.

The Solaris Biotechnology (in November 2021) buyout strengthened its presence across several end markets, including food and beverage, biopharma and other major life sciences.Donaldson’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are noteworthy.

249,89ea6116-c128-314f-89c4-d9f2351b6fac,VMC,2023-05-13,Here's Why Vulcan Materials (VMC) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-vulcan-materials-vmc-160004308.html,1683907204,STORY,['VMC'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Vulcan Materials (VMC), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Vulcan Materials currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for VMC that show why this construction materials company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor VMC, shares are up 10.54% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry is up 1.85% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.97% compares favorably with the industry's 1.85% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Vulcan Materials have risen 5.1%, and are up 18% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 1.38% and 6.62%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to VMC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VMC is currently averaging 772,874 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VMC.Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VMC's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.90 to $6.40 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that VMC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Vulcan Materials on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

251,ed7f67c4-ba65-330a-b0f6-a63eab318854,GE,2023-05-13,"With 73% institutional ownership, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/73-institutional-ownership-general-electric-140030086.html,1683900030,STORY,"['GE', 'TROW']","[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in General Electric implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 12 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 73% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of General Electric. See our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that General Electric does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Electric. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 12%. With 8.0% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$269m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over General Electric. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  General Electric is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...Ultimately the future is most important.

252,268a6300-fe1f-357d-8356-a88c202102af,VLO,2023-05-13,Investors Heavily Search Valero Energy Corporation (VLO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-valero-energy-130001761.html,1683896401,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -16.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.14 per share, indicating a change of -46% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -17.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.21 points to a change of -20.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -10%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.63 indicates a change of -37% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $36.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -30%. The $143.45 billion and $136.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.7% and -4.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Weighed down by shrinking margins, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings in the remainder of 2023. Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistant inflation continues to eat into profits. Nevertheless, the space continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Valero Energy VLO, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum).

The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureSoftening Margin Backdrop: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will drive down profitability further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.     Fuel Demand Remains Healthy: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Ongoing Supply-Chain Bottlenecks: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of some 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has inched up 1.2% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.4%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 1.34X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.17X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.78X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.30X, with a median of 4.31X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Stocks to Watch ForMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

254,4eade884-81cc-31ce-9e6d-91441d72f09a,UNH,2023-05-13,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-attracting-130001265.html,1683896401,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -7.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.03 indicates a change of +12.2% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $90.15 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.2%. The $363.59 billion and $385.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.2% and +6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $91.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. EPS of $6.26 for the same period compares with $5.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.92%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kellogg's K, Wix.com WIX and Celsius Holdings CELH.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Kraft Heinz Company is one of North America's largest consumer packaged food and beverage companies. A few of its products include condiments and sauces, cheese, dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products.Currently, the stock boasts the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating that analysts have become bullish on its near-term outlook.In addition, the stock resides in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, which is currently ranked in the top 25% (4 out of 16) of all Zacks Sectors. With a favorable earnings outlook, let's take a look at a few other attractive aspects that KHC shares are displaying.Share Performance &amp; Quarterly ResultsKHC shares have found buyers over the last month, climbing 3.5% in value and outperforming the S&amp;P 500 modestly. As we can see in the chart below, the market reacted positively to the company's latest release, with shares getting a nice boost post-earnings.Regarding the latest release, the results were solid. Kraft Heinz posted earnings of $0.68 per share, 13% above the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate. Quarterly revenue totaled $6.5 billion, modestly above expectations and improving 7.3% from the year-ago period.Pricing power helped drive the strong results, with the print reflecting the 13th consecutive quarter of Kraft Heinz exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate.ValuationThe company's shares aren't stretched regarding valuation, with the current 14.2X forward earnings multiple sitting just above the five-year median and well below the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Story continuesIn addition, KHC shares trade at a 1.8X forward price-to-sales ratio, nearly in line with the five-year median and again well below the Zacks sector average.KHC carries a Style Score of ""C"" for Value.DividendsFor those seeking income, KHC shares provide precisely what you're looking for. The company's annual dividend currently yields 3.9%, well above the Zacks sector average of 2.7%.Still, it's worth noting that the company hasn't increased its payout in some time, perhaps steering away those who seek consistent dividend growth.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.The Kraft Heinz Company would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Estee Lauder Companies is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Share Performance &amp; Quarterly ResultsEL shares have struggled to find traction over the last month, down nearly 20% and underperforming relative to the general market. As we can see by the red arrow circled in the chart below, the market had a poor reaction to EL's latest quarterly release.In the above-mentioned release, EL posted EPS of $0.47, 4% below expectations and reflecting a 75% year-over-year pullback. Still, top line results showed some positivity, with EL beating sales expectations by roughly 1%.It's worth noting that the recent EPS miss broke a long-standing trend of positive earnings surprises.ValuationEL shares may not entice value-focused investors, reflected by its Style Score of ""F"" for Value. Presently, Estee Lauder shares trade at a 51.2X forward earnings multiple, well above the 36.2X five-year median.The company's forward price-to-sales ratio presently works out to be 4.5X, nearly in line with the five-year median and below the Zacks sector average.DividendsThe company rewards its shareholders, with its annual dividend currently yielding a respectable 1.3%.Undoubtedly worth highlighting, the company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding investors, carrying a 12% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Bottom LineA recent EPS miss on the minds of investors and negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook over the last several months.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Stocks Seeing Recent Analyst UpgradesPrice targets can be helpful for investors, as they can facilitate a more structured trade with pre-determined exit levels. Of course, it's important to remember that not all stocks reach analysts' forecasted levels.Price targets are based on a variety of factors, including the company's financial performance, industry trends, and overall market conditions.And recently, three stocks – Kellogg's, Wix.com and Celsius Holdings – have all seen favorable upgrades from analysts. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Let's take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.Celsius HoldingsCelsius, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates within the functional energy drinks and liquid supplement categories internationally and in the United States. BofA Securities recently raised its PT for CELH shares from $98 to $125 per share.The upgrade followed better-than-expected results on May 9th; CELH exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 80% and delivered a 15% revenue surprise. As shown below, the company's revenue growth has been stellar.In 2022, the company signed a $550 million distribution agreement with heavyweight PepsiCo, which is undoubtedly paying off.Kellogg's Kellogg's manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, carrying a balanced portfolio of products. JPMorgan raised its PT for Kellogg's shares from $68 to $72 per share following a beat-and-raise quarter.In the release, the cereal giant posted a 10% EPS beat and raised guidance for organic-based growth in net sales. Quarterly revenue totaled $4.1 billion, 2.4% above expectations and improving 13% from the year-ago period.Similar to other defensive stocks, Kellogg's shares could entice income-focused investors, with the current 3.4% annual dividend yield sitting well above the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Dividend growth is there, too, with the company carrying a 1.4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Wix.comWix.com, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a cloud-based web development platform offering solutions that enable consumers to develop customized websites and application platforms. Raymond James upgraded the stock, announcing a PT of $96 per share.It's hard to ignore the company's growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to jump significantly in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 55% in FY24. The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue climbs of 9.5% in FY23 and 11.7% in FY24.Analysts have remained bullish for the company's current fiscal year for some time, with the FY23 EPS Estimate being revised notably higher since the end of May last year.Bottom LinePrice targets can help investors structure a trade, as they reflect current sentiment around the stock.And recently, all three stocks above have received favorable upgrades from analysts.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

258,f59997d0-66f6-3861-90c8-f5372afb1f34,SLG,2023-05-13,7 Dividend Stocks to Avoid as Interest Rates Rise in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-avoid-interest-011010849.html,1683594610.0,STORY,"['USB', 'PACW', 'AGNC', 'SLG', 'MPW', 'STWD', 'UWMC-WS']","[Although the next round of key inflation reports could change their tune, Federal Reserve officials for now remain adamant about raising interest rates to curb inflation. In fact, if they do it’s important to stay away from the worst dividend stocks for rising rates.Sure, plenty of contrarian investors believe that the Fed is on the verge of “pivoting” on interest rates. First, by easing on rate hikes. Then, by lowering rates back down. However, it’s not for certain whether the Fed will pivot, merely on the sign of cooling inflation, or even if/when a recession happens. With the rate of inflation still “sticky,” and well above the central bank’s own target of 2% per year, the Fed may deem it necessary to keep raising rates, no matter the near-term consequences. This could severely hurt stocks in this category, in two ways.First, the dividend stocks and interest rates correlation is very high with these names. An increase in interest rates leads to a similar decline in their valuation. Second, there are high-yielders whose fundamentals could be worsened by higher rates. Until the Fed changes its tune, avoid these seven worst dividend stocks for rising rates.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAGNCAGNC Investment$9.50MPWMedical Properties Trust$8.57PACWPacWest Bancorp$5.97SLGSL Green Realty$22.00STWDStarwood Property Trust$16.76USBUS Bancorp$29.74UWMCUWM Holdings45.85AGNC Investment (AGNC)Grayish photo of investor's hands hovering over laptop with red stock graph showing downward arrow overlayed on top of the imageSource: shutterstock.com/Leonid SorokinAGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) is one of the better-known real estate investment trusts that invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities. With a high dividend yield (15.21%) and monthly payouts, AGNC may seem at first like a great opportunity for income-focused investors. However, the rising rate environment has taken a toll on AGNC stock, in two ways. First, as higher rates have led to portfolio losses, the stock has fallen from around $15 to just under $9.50 per share since the start of 2022. Second, higher rates have squeezed the spread between AGNC’s borrowing costs and the interest income generated from its portfolio.Story continuesHigher rates will keep this mortgage REIT under pressure, due to further portfolio write-downs. Although it has not lowered its payout since 2020, AGNC may also end up becoming a dividend cutter once again, as higher rates squeeze its net income once again.Medical Properties Trust (MPW)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is one of the biggest dividend trap stocks currently out there. This healthcare REIT is another name that has become popular amongst contrarians, who believe that its low valuation and high dividend yield (13.5%) more than makes up for an elevated level of risk.In addition, some commentators have argued that concerns over rate hike risks are overblown with MPW stock. Nevertheless, these counter-arguments have yet to sway the market’s view on this REIT. Even as only a portion of its fixed rate debt matures (and therefore needs to be refinanced at higher rates) in the near-term, this could still have an impact. MPW could remain at risk of having to unload assets at unfavorable prices. Reduced cash flow could result in a much-anticipated dividend cut finally happening. With so much still up in the air, stay away.PacWest Bancorp (PACW)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockBanks are some of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates. Mostly, because higher rates have decreased the market value of loans/securities made/purchased back when rates were significantly lower. Yet among these names, PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) is one of the most vulnerable due to this factor.Many investors hold this view, including InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung. That’s not to say, though, that this PacWest is doomed to become the next First Republic (OTCMKTS:FRCB). So far in May, PacWest has been scrambling to save itself. For instance, the regional bank has been exploring a sale for the whole bank, or of some of its assets. That’s not all. PACW has also slashed its quarterly dividend from 25 cents to just a penny. Now lacking a high-yield, yet still at high risk of shareholder experience a FRCB-style total wipeout, resist the urge to roll the dice with this situation.SL Green Realty (SLG)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockRising rates have made investors bearish on REITs in general, but the persistence of the “work from home” trend has made them especially bearish about office building REITs like SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG). In fact, this REIT, which owns a portfolio of office buildings in New York City, hasn’t just fallen out of favor.As real estate publication The Real Deal recently detailed, SLG stock has become the most heavily-shorted major office REIT, with 15.5% of its outstanding float sold short. There’s a good reason as to why the short trade has become crowded with SL Green. More heavily leveraged than its peers, and with swaps on its variable rate debt soon expiring, SLG’s borrowing costs could skyrocket as it refinances at higher rates. This puts its dividend (14.4% forward yield) under threat. Higher rates and vacancy issues also stand to further lower SLG’s underlying value.Starwood Property Trust (STWD)earningsSource: ShutterstockMuch like SL Green Realty, Starwood Property Trust (NYSE:STWD) is another of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates that has become a popular short-seller target. According to Bloomberg, STWD stock, along with Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT), have become some of the most heavily-shorted mortgage REIT stocks in recent months. Current trends in office space demand back up the bear case. As remote working trends keep vacancy rates high, defaults among commercial mortgage securities may be poised to rise as well.Sure, 99% of Starwood’s portfolio consists of floating rate loans. This leaves it not vulnerable to rising rates. In fact, higher rates could increase STWD’s net interest margin. That said, higher rates have been a factor in rising commercial mortgage defaults. Hence, a further rise could cause additional defaults, leading to asset write-downs that put pressure on STWD, outweighing its juicy 11.5% forward dividend.US Bancorp (USB)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockIt’s not just small, regional banks that are too risky to touch in today’s environment. US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), a larger, more established financial institution, is in a precarious situation right now. At least, that’s the view of Holdco Asset Management.Holdco, which has shorted USB stock, issued a “short report” on it back on April 17. In a nutshell, Holdco’s argument is that, when you account for unrealized loan losses (caused by rising interest rates), US Bancorp has become undercapitalized. Due to regulatory quirks, it has managed to avoid including these losses when calculating its capital ratios, but soon may have to do so.If this happens, USB may have to raise more capital, diluting shareholders. This issue could also affect USB’s ability to maintain its current high dividend (6.25%). With this, it may just well be one of the worst dividend stocks for rising rates.UWM Holdings (UWMC)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockShares in wholesale mortgage lender UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC) have been on the rise in recent months. Even as the housing slowdown continues, a strong earnings report in March, plus renewed hopes of a housing recovery, have helped to renew bullishness.However, this renewed bullishness for UWMC stock could prove to be premature in hindsight. As mortgage rates move higher in tandem with the Fed’s latest rate hikes, the housing downtown could worsen before it improves. The impact of higher rates (for example, higher unemployment) could lead to a further worsening of the housing market. As the downturn continues, UWM’s earnings stand to remain depressed. This calls into question its ability to maintain its 6.86% forward dividend yield. Assuming that this stock’s dividend cut risk will rise again if rates inch higher, consider UWMC one of the dividend stocks to sell before the next rate hike.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Presently, the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with its earnings outlook improving across all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted a big beat in its latest release just on May 4th; VMC exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 50% and reported revenue 4% ahead of expectations. The market had a strong reaction post-earnings, with shares seeing a solid boost.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, the company has displayed a shareholder-friendly nature, growing its dividend payout by nearly 10% over the last five years.

260,7d84bcbd-24bf-33f4-96eb-f4c1bb75b45e,DHI,2023-05-13,3 Top Ranked Stocks for Momentum Traders to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-stocks-momentum-153003062.html,1683905403,STORY,"['DHI', 'SKX', 'META']","[To the surprise of nearly everyone, markets have been very strong so far this year. While many analysts had forecasts for a recession and another challenging year for the stock market, the S&amp;P 500 is up 8% and Nasdaq 18% YTD.One way to take advantage of a market that stubbornly continues to grind higher is to focus on momentum stocks. Momentum trading is the simple concept of buying the leaders, because there is a good chance that they will continue to be the leaders. It isn’t just an aphorism either, the momentum anomaly is one of the most researched and implemented trading concepts in markets, utilized by some of the biggest funds in the world.One way to further improve your momentum trading outcomes is to focus on momentum stocks that also have high Zacks Ranks. Trading only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further improves your odds of buying a winner, because analysts have been upgrading earnings expectations.To improve trading odds even further, investors can buy stocks that also have high probability chart patterns. Utilizing technical chart patterns helps traders rigorously define the entry and exit signals, keeping them out of trades that don’t look right, and getting them in trades with high risk-reward setups.In this article I will focus on three stocks that have all three of these characteristics. Skechers SKX, D.R. Horton DHI, and Meta Platforms META all have strong momentum, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and compelling technical chart setups.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSkechersSkechers, founded in 1992, is an international designer, developer, marketer, and distributor of footwear. Skechers products are available in more than 170 countries with 4,549 stores, including 548 domestic stores, 927 international locations and 3,074 distributors, licensees, and franchise stores.SKX stock has had a very strong start to this year, rallying 25% in the last four months. SKX has also been a high performing stock over the last decade. Over that period, it has returned 22% annually, more than 6’xing investors’ money, and handily outperforming the broad market.Story continuesHowever, if you look closely at the performance chart below, you will see most of those gains came in the early years of the last decade, trading mostly sideways since 2015. But, based on the current setup, SKX looks like it may be at the start of another major bull run.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the price action chart below we see SKX had built out a solid base through the first few months of the year. When a stock bases like this, it means large investors are slowly building a position. Then at the end of April the stock broke out above $50 with a convincing gap higher, that has yet to be filled.Now through May, SKX has built out a tight consolidation, bull flag from which we can measure a trade from. If SKX stock can trade above $53.50, it should break out higher, and make new all-time highs. Alternatively, if the stock trades below the bottom of the range, $51.70, the setup is invalidated.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewD.R. HortonD.R. Horton is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 110 markets in 33 states.DHI has been a steady performing stock over the last 10 years. In that time, it has put up an annualized return of 16%, beating the index’s 12.4% annualized return.Additionally, DHI is part of the Building Products – Home Builders industry in Zacks Industry Rank. Home builders have been one of the strongest industries in the market this year, surprising most, who thought housing would get crushed as the economy slows.Nonetheless, it charges higher. Home Builders are in the top 3% of industries in the Zacks Industry Rank, considerably outperforming the market and demonstrating the momentum of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchD.R. Horton has a convincing technical chart pattern as well. After building and breaking out of a bull flag in the first few months of the year, DHI is coiling again for another momentum breakout. Like SKX, the stock gapped up, and is holding right near its high of the year. This is very bullish price action.If the price can break out above the $110 level, more buyers should step in and send the stock to new all-time highs. But, if the stock trades below the $106 level, the setup is invalid.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewMeta PlatformsMeta Platforms META is the strongest performing stock in S&amp;P 500 this year. The stock is up a very impressive 96% YTD. Even after collapsing a brutal -75% in 2022, META stock has returned 800% over the last ten years, which is 24% annualized.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike the other stocks, META has been gapping up and holding key levels. On this chart I have marked the $220 level, which was the pre-Covid highs, an important level for many stocks.After trading through that level, META has built out a clear bull flag. If META can trade above the $240 level, it should make another push higher. Alternatively, below the $230 level and the setup is invalid.But, if the price trades below $230, and then holds the pre-Covid level of $220 it may build out a secondary base to trade from. Because META is up nearly 100% this year, it is possible the stock will take some time to rest, although the momentum is clearly strong in this one.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewBottom LineWhen trading momentum stocks it is critical to set a trading plan and stick with it. Even more important is to be very mindful of risk management. Picking a stop loss and knowing exactly how much you may lose on the trade is the most important decision in the setup.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PGTI reported mixed results for first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Apr 1, 2023). Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missed the same. Yet, both the metrics grew year over year, backed by strong operational execution, solid pricing actions taken to offset materials and wage inflation, and cost containment measures.Following the results, shares of this national leader in premium windows and doors plunged about 3% during the trading session on May 11. Investors’ sentiments might have been hurt by the tepid Q2 guidance.Nonetheless, the company’s backlog grew compared to last quarter, thanks to a solid repair &amp; remodel channel, which offset the softness in housing demand.Jeff Jackson, PGTI’s president and chief executive officer, stated, “For the total Company, we saw a contraction in new construction demand versus prior year but are cautiously optimistic that new construction will rebound in the coming quarters based on recent industry reports. Fortunately, the strength in our repair and remodel channel has allowed us to offset softness in new construction.”Inside the Headline NumbersThe company reported adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, which surpassed the consensus mark of 44 cents by 27.3% and increased 33.3% year over year.PGT, Inc.

QuoteIts net sales of $376.8 million missed the consensus mark of $379 million by 0.5% but grew 5% year over year. This was driven by strong organic growth of 3%. The Southeast segment reported 3.8% net sales growth. The Western segment recorded a 9.1% year-over-year rise.Total Open Order backlog of $236 million was sequentially up from $235 million on strong R&amp;R demand, partially offset by lower new construction demand. Orders in the Southeast region grew 15% year over year. Western region organic orders declined 16% from the previous year due to wet weather in California and Arizona.Story continuesMarginsThe company’s gross profit increased 10.9% year over year to $149.2 million. Also, gross margin of 39.6% expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18.4% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $70 million and adjusted EBITDA margin surged 210 bps to 18.6%.Balance SheetAs of Apr 1, 2023, PGT Innovations had cash and cash equivalents of $48.3 million compared with $66.5 million at fiscal 2022-end. Also, it had a revolver availability of nearly $163 million. Long-term debt was $645.1 million compared with $642.1 million at fiscal 2022-end.Net cash provided by operating activities was $23.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2023 compared with $17.3 million a year ago.In the fiscal first quarter, it repurchased $25.9 million worth of shares under a $250.0 million share repurchase plan.Q2 GuidanceThe company expects net sales within $380-$400 million, down from $407 million reported in the prior year quarter. Owing to the persisting material inflation and market softness, PGTI anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $70-$75 million, down from $78 million reported in the prior year period.For the second quarter, the company expects depreciation and amortization to be within $15-$16 million, interest expense of approximately $8 million, stock-based compensation of nearly $3 million, capital expenditure (as a percentage of net sales) in the 4%-5% range and a tax rate between 25% and 26%.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesPGTI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Horton Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-d-123012685.html,1683894612,STORY,['DHI'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in D.R. Horton (DHI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DHI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?D.R. Horton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at D.R. Horton's main business drivers.D.R. Horton, Inc., based in Texas, is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 110 markets in 33 states in the East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West regions of the United States. Its houses are sold under the brand names D.R. Horton - America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes.D.R. Horton’s reporting segments are as follows: Homebuilding (contributing 95.3% to total revenues in fiscal 2022), Forestar (4.5%), Financial Services (2.4%) and Rental (1.5%). Of the total revenues, 3.7% represents the elimination of intercompany transactions &amp; Other. The Homebuilding segment comprises six reporting regions and derives revenues primarily from the sale of completed homes built on lots it develops and on finished lots purchased ready for home construction. In addition to single-family detached homes (accounting for around 90% of home sale revenues), the segment builds attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. The segment also derives revenues by selling lands and lots.As of Mar 31, 2023, the Forestar land development reporting segment operated in 52 markets and 20 states, where it owns — directly or through joint ventures — interests in residential and mixed-use projects. Forestar Group Inc. (FOR), a publicly-traded residential and real estate development company, is a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton. On Mar 31, 2023, D.R. Horton owned 63% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock.The Financial Services segment, through the mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, provides mortgage financing and title agency services primarily to the company’s homebuilding customers.The Rental segment includes its single-family and multi-family rental operations. Meanwhile, the company remains engaged in other business activities through subsidiaries, through which it conducts insurance-related operations and owns non-residential real estate. These operations are grouped together and presented as other.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For D.R. Horton, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $4,020.26, or a 302.03% gain, as of May 12, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 152.84% and gold's return of 34.05% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for DHI too.D.R. Horton reported second-quarter fiscal 2023, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although, earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis due to prevailing softness in the market, the company highlighted that net sales orders increased 73% from the fiscal first quarter, defying the prevailing higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures. The company also believes that the housing demand will remain favorable, courtesy of a limited supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points despite challenging market conditions, comprising higher rates and uncertain economic conditions. DHI’s production capabilities, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points are encouraging.The stock is up 11.40% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 16 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The upsurge in passenger volumes makes the AAL stock an interesting investment opportunity.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has been revised 45.4% and 29.4% upward, over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.Given the wealth of information at the brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.Upbeat Air-travel Demand: American Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand.Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues in first-quarter 2023 increased 37% year over year. Passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (91.1%), increased to $11,103 million from $7,818 million a year ago. To match the high demand, AAL is increasing capacity.AAL expects system capacity for the June-end quarter to increase 3.5-5.5% from the second-quarter 2022 reported level. Management projects second-quarter 2023 earnings per share (excluding net special items) between $1.20 and $1.40. AAL estimates 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.50-$3.50.Impressive Price Performance: Driven by the rosy air-travel demand scenario, shares of AAL  have gained10.6% year to date compared with its industry’s appreciation of 6.1% in the same timeframe. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Bullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which AAL belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 37 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the company at the top 15% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.Story continuesAn ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider stocks like Copa Holdings CPA and United Airlines UAL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Copa Holdings is benefiting from an improvement in air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, passenger revenues increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels due to higher yields.CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging. In first-quarter 2023, cargo and mail revenues grew 51.8% from the comparable quarter of 2019 on higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised 6.15% upward over the past 60 days.United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June-end quarter to grow 14-16% year over year.For 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to be in the high teens.

265,79d4e542-226a-38f7-8b6a-8f6697900dee,AAL,2023-05-13,Can American Airlines (AAL) Climb 26.3% to Reach the Level Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-climb-26-135501887.html,1683899701,STORY,"['TGT', 'AAL']","[Shares of American Airlines (AAL) have gained 8.7% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $14.07, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $17.77 indicates a potential upside of 26.3%.The average comprises 14 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $9.50 to a high of $28, with a standard deviation of $5.46. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 32.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 99% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in AAL. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for AALHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why AAL Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.8% over the past month, as seven estimates have gone higher while one has gone lower.Moreover, AAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Pfizer: A dividend powerhouse with strong financial health scorePharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a household name, but did you know it’s also a dividend powerhouse? The company’s payout stands at a fantastic 4.3%, and it has raised its dividend annually for the last dozen years in a row. Its InvestingPro financial health score is solid at 3.61, largely thanks to robust profits and a nice cash flow that should keep those dividends coming. Shares are down some 27% for the year to $37.34, and analysts expect a rise of more than 35% from here. So it may be time for investors of all kinds - but especially dividend investors - to swoop in and pick up some Pfizer.Robert Half International's share buybacksStaffing name Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI) pays a solid 2.9% dividend yield, and has upped its payout for the past 19 straight years — which certainly gives its dividend investors peace of mind. Not only is its dividend high, but it has also been returning cash to shareholders by aggressively buying back shares. Its profits and cash flow are both exceptional, giving it a very nice 3.06 InvestingPro financial health score, and analysts figure it has more than 30% upside from current levels. Shares are down 9.1% for the year to $66.87.Aflac's financial health supported by price momentum and cash flowAflac (NYSE:AFL), the insurance giant, has a proven track record of 39 consecutive years of dividend bumps, earning it the coveted title of ""dividend aristocrat."" It also sports a generous dividend payout of 2.5%, and Wall Street analysts price targets put stock upside at an impressive 15%. Aflac's respectable InvestingPro financial health score, moreover, is 2.83 thanks to its exceptional price momentum and strong cash flow. Shares have slipped some 8% year to date to $66.10.Story continuesRegions Financial's potential 30% upsideRegions Financial (NYSE:RF) has raised its dividend payout annually for the past decade, and the current dividend payout of 5.1% is particularly impressive. The bank boasts a robust financial health score of 2.94, largely thanks to its lofty profits — and, per both fair value estimates and analyst projections, the stock is undervalued and could see a surge of at least 30%. Shares are down 27% for the year to $15.74, offering a chance to get in at a great price.Texas Instruments: Growth and dividends in the same stockTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has ratcheted up its dividend payout for 19 years in a row, and this reliable payout is a juicy 3%, adding to the company's appeal. On top of that, the chipmaker’s InvestingPro fair value gives the stock significant upside, and the company boasts a solid InvestingPro financial health score of 2.89, in large part due to its mouth-watering profits and strong cash flow. Shares are nearly breakeven for the year at $161.Related ArticlesPro Exclusive: 5 dividend dazzlers to fuel your income streamProcter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"
268,bae9d454-e350-3e00-9eff-05080d4fb0a7,SHW,2023-05-13,Is It Worth Considering The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) For Its Upcoming Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-considering-sherwin-williams-company-121713747.html,1683980233,STORY,['SHW'],"[It looks like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Sherwin-Williams' shares before the 18th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$2.42 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Sherwin-Williams has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $227.43. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Sherwin-Williams has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Sherwin-Williams's payout ratio is modest, at just 29% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Sherwin-Williams generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 51% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Sherwin-Williams's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Sherwin-Williams earnings per share are up 5.4% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Sherwin-Williams has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Sherwin-Williams an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Sherwin-Williams paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Sherwin-Williams today.While it's tempting to invest in Sherwin-Williams for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, Sherwin-Williams has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Union Pacific is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$9.7b ÷ (US$66b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 16%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 14% generated by the Transportation industry. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Union Pacific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Union Pacific here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Union Pacific Tell Us?There hasn't been much to report for Union Pacific's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Union Pacific in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Union Pacific has been paying out a decent 43% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Union Pacific's ROCEIn a nutshell, Union Pacific has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 54% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Like most companies, Union Pacific does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The biggest tidbit of gossip was that Buffett considers Apple to be the best business that they own. Additionally, he said Berkshire was not intending on buying out Occidental Petroleum.But what if, as an investor, you wanted to own the various businesses that Buffett owns, but you didn’t want to do so by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway? Berkshire Hathaway now has $130 billion in cash but doesn’t pay a dividend. That’s a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines.It’s also not cheap, with a forward P/E of 17.Creating Your Own Mini Berkshire HathawayAnyone can mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s equity portfolio. That’s easy. The company files Form 4s every quarter disclosing what stocks they are buying, and selling.But what about its other businesses? It owns See’s Candy, Dairy Queen, BNSF Railroad, Nebraska Furniture Market and a bunch of other companies.5 Berkshire-Like Companies You Could Buy Right Now1.       Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)Union Pacific Corp. is a big American railroad, similar to Berkshire’s BNSF.Shares of Union Pacific are down 4.3% year-to-date but it’s not that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 17.8.Earnings are expected to be up 0.09% this year and 7.1% in 2024. But is that enough to pay 17.8x?Should you buy Union Pacific, and old economy stock, in 2023?Story continues2.       Haverty Furniture (HVT)Haverty Furniture operates 100 showrooms in 16 southern and Midwest states. Founded in 1885, Haverty is in the same mold as some of Buffett’s furniture investments like Nebraska Furniture Market.Shares of Haverty have fallen 14.6% year-to-date. It’s dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. Haverty also pays a dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.However, with the US housing market slowing, so are Haverty’s sales. Sales fell 5.9% in the first quarter.Is Haverty a deal?3.       The Hershey Company (HSY)Hershey is a confection and food company that makes famous candy brands such as Reese’s and Almond Joy. While it’s not identical to Berkshire’s See’s Candy, it’s the closest publicly traded candy company out there.Hershey shares have been on a tear in 2023, gaining 18.7%. It’s also near a 5-year high. But Hershey doesn’t come cheap. It’s trading at 29x.Is Hershey over bought?4.       Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG)Signet Jewelers is an option if you want to own a jewelry store like Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway bought Helzberg Diamonds in 1996.Shares of Signet Jewelers are up 5.5% year-to-date and 88% over the last 5 years. The 5-year performance easily beats the S&amp;P 500, which is up 51.7% during that time.Signet Jewelers is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.2.Should you consider Signet Jewelers even thought a recession may be coming?5.       Redfin Corp. (RDFN)Redfin is a real estate brokerage. Did you know that Berkshire Hathaway also owns one? It’s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.It’s been a wild couple of years for Redfin’s shares. Over the last 2 years, it’s down 78% but in 2023, Redfin is hot, gaining 161%.Redfin doesn’t have a P/E as earnings are expected to be negative in both 2023 and 2024.Is a rebound in housing already priced into Redfin shares?What Else do Value Investors Need to Know About Creating a Mini Berkshire Hathaway?

274,4b690841-629c-3304-b875-4a0b4b9358ad,AMP,2023-05-13,Investing in Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) three years ago would have delivered you a 154% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-ameriprise-financial-nyse-amp-110049197.html,1683975649,STORY,['AMP'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 16% in that time. In contrast, the return over three years has been impressive. The share price marched upwards over that time, and is now 140% higher than it was. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last three years, Ameriprise Financial failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 8.5% (annualized).So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.The modest 1.8% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It could be that the revenue growth of 6.8% per year is viewed as evidence that Ameriprise Financial is growing. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthAmeriprise Financial is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ameriprise Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 154%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ameriprise Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 18% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ameriprise Financial better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Ameriprise Financial .We will like Ameriprise Financial better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?
