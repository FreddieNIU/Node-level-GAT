Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we get started, I want to welcome everyone watching us via webcast. I'm really excited about this. It's new for us on the Investor Relations side, but we've been talking to our subscribers and potential subscribers like this for years. Today, we're coming to you live from our Baltimore studio, where we create content for our subscribers, host webinars, and reach out to our audience of self-directed investors.I wanted to give you insight into our operations and let you see us work. I hope that you like the format as well as the content, and I'm looking forward to your feedback. You can send it to ir@marketwise.com.Turning to this morning's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results. I'll give you an update on the progress we're making with the goals I outlined on prior calls, and I'll give you a peak into what's going on at our affiliates. I'll look into our process, what we see working and some new initiatives. Steve will then take over and provide a more detailed review of our financial results.Let's get started. First, let's discuss our Q2 results. Frankly, what we experienced in the second quarter is a lot like what we've seen in the past few quarters. Investors and subscribers are still engaged in buying financial research, but at lower levels than we saw during the boom years of 2020 and 2021. The good news is that many of our internal metrics show that we've reached a plateau of sorts.Our billings and expenses are fairly flat to the prior quarter. Engagement as measured by landing page visits is slightly up over the past three quarters and our overall conversion rates are starting to show signs of improvement.Stock market sentiment seems to be shifting back to equities as inflation looks to moderate over the next year, and it's very encouraging to see signs of stabilization in our results.While market volatility and economic uncertainty persisted through the second quarter, which continued to weigh on our results, we focused on creating new content and reaching new subscribers, and we remain committed to managing our overhead costs and to directing our marketing spend where it is most efficient. Importantly, we successfully maintained our expense discipline during the quarter, as we have over the past year.In the second quarter of 2023, direct marketing spend was roughly $23 million lower on a cash basis than the second quarter 2022. Additionally, our overhead costs were down $1.5 million on the same basis. As I mentioned last quarter, we know our cost structure and we work hard to rein in costs when times are tough, so that we can maintain our cash flow and profitability.Turning to our results in more detail. Revenues on a GAAP basis were $103.6 million, a decline of 19% as compared to the prior year. Billings declined 18.2% year-over-year to $96.2 million.Importantly, our adjusted cash flow from operations was $29 million in 2Q 2023, an increase from $26.8 million in the second quarter of 2022 and a clear sign of our ability to generate positive cash flow in a challenging market.Furthermore, our adjusted cash flow from operations margin for the first half of 2023 improved to 17% as compared to 11% for the first half of 2022, reflecting the success of our cost reduction efforts over the past year.I would add that while GAAP revenues declined $22.6 million from the prior quarter, billings declined only $1 million. As a reminder, for GAAP purposes, we defer revenue over the life of a subscription, while non-GAAP billings represent current period cash received. In 2020 and 2021, we generated record quarterly billings, which increased our GAAP revenues for the subsequent quarters, but that's beginning to tail off and our GAAP comparisons reflect that.Despite the difficult market environment, we're pleased with our ability to cut spending and increase our cash flow on both a quarterly and year-over-year basis. We will continue to look for ways to improve efficiencies, cash flow, and profitability.Additionally, we have started to see improving trends in our business through June and July. While it's early and we remain conservative, it's an encouraging trend. These green shoots appear as they always do in our subscriber acquisition efforts.On previous calls and in some of my conversations with you, I've noted that the most important thing we needed to do to start improving results was to figure out how to talk to prospective readers again. These are the folks we saw sitting on the sidelines. They required a new message that would give us a click, a sign up, an order, a new subscriber.Of course, the backbone of our business is the folks who've been with us for a long time. I'll get into that more later. But to kick start the business, we need to bring on new high-quality readers, folks who will become long-term membership subscribers. And to bring on new high-quality readers, we need to find the right message.In 2022, the message changed. Themes that have been working for years, stopped generating the same level of engagement. So, we dialed back our marketing spend to focus on only the most efficient campaign, we dialed up our efforts to find the next big idea.Each of our publishers is equipped to do this on their own very effectively. Each operates multiple brands that can feature different angles on the market. And when you put all of our publishers and all of our 13 brands together, we have a formidable engine of discovery.This, I believe, is a key driver of our durability as a business. We have multiple affiliates that are essentially competitors, targeting the same potential customers. Where other businesses try to reduce redundancy, we embrace it because it means that every month, we can run dozens of different campaigns and every day, we can run dozens of different marketing experiments.In fact, during 2022, we ran almost 470 individual marketing campaigns. This is what allows us to find what works faster than any single affiliate could on its own. And that's always been in place. It's allowed us to manage the business through decades of boom-and-bust markets and stocks, commodities, cryptos, you name it.But I'm working to accelerate learning throughout the business. I've put in place programs to identify and spread best practices, and I've increased the amount of reporting we share across the business. Today, our key personnel can quickly seize on innovations and put them to work.Now I'm focusing on marketing here, but this principle applies to every area of operations from customer service, to website design, to new technologies, like artificial intelligence. It's early days, but I'm excited about the efficiencies we could achieve by integrating some of the newly available tech into our operations.Right now, though, I'm even more excited by the new line of business that AI is creating for us. Predictive Alpha Prime, for example, is a new AI-powered tool from our TradeSmith affiliate. It had a very successful launch in the quarter, which led to additional products leveraged from this launch, including an options trading product, a new entry-level product, and a bundled offering of all Predictive Alpha publications.AI themes are driving new subscriptions at InvestorPlace, where the focus is on how to invest in AI and related products. And we expect to see multiple new products and campaigns focusing on this sector throughout the rest of the year.We are always looking for ways to add value to our subscribers. The folks who know us well, including our high and ultra high-value subscribers who remain loyal to us over the long-term. In fact, we have over 290,000 membership subscribers whose cumulative spend continues to increase despite the challenging environment.These membership subscribers typically sign on for an additional five subscriptions, including one additional membership subscription, after their initial membership purchase. These long-term subscribers are the core of our renewal revenue, which is one of the best measures of the success of our business.Over the past five quarters, we've averaged a total of $37 million in upgrade and renewal billings each quarter. These metrics support what we've known for over 20 years that long-term subscribers are the heart of our business, and their trust and confidence in our publications reflect the value they find in our products.As I touched on earlier, we have started to see improving trends through the end of the second quarter and into July. Both investor engagement and conversions have improved slightly, as we've seen some success in recent campaigns. And as a result, we have begun to strategically increase some of our direct marketing spend.Consequently, we're starting to see an increase in subscriber acquisition, which is encouraging. That said, I still want to caution that these results reflect only a few weeks of results. And it remains to be seen if this is a trend in overall subscriber activity or specific to certain campaigns that we've recently launched.Direct marketing spend is our largest variable spend. And while we have reduced that spend over the past year, we fully anticipate increasing our marketing expense as market conditions indicate.We also continue to work on ways to reward our shareholders. Last week, we announced our second quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to our Class A shareholders and an equivalent distribution for our Class B shareholders. As of this morning, this represents a 2.2% annual yield.We're pleased to continue this dividend as it highlights our ability to generate positive annual cash flow even near the bottom of the cycle. Over our 20-plus year history, our company has consistently returned capital to its owners. We are pleased to reward our shareholders with another dividend, while working to increase total shareholder returns.We continue to also look for ways to add existing businesses that will complement our operations, including bringing on new editorial teams, software and technologies. While we are actively looking for M&amp;A opportunities, we are also committed to sound financial transactions with acceptable levels of risk and return for our shareholders.In terms of talent retention and acquisition, I'm happy to share that we've completed our search to bring a permanent CFO to MarketWise. As we announced a few weeks ago, Erik Mickels will be joining us later this month in the role of CFO. Erik is an experienced public company CFO and brings with him a wealth of knowledge in financial management, accounting, and navigating the public markets.He also has hands-on experience bringing a private company to the public market via SPAC and all that comes with that transaction. We welcome Erik and look forward to his contributions going forward.I also want to take this opportunity to thank Steve Park for his service to us as our Interim CFO over the past few months. Steve is the consummate professional and joined us during a hectic time. He helped us get to the finish line for our year-end and first quarter reporting cycles. And as Steve finishes his engagement with us, we wish him well and nothing but success for what comes ahead. The whole team, myself, in particular is very grateful for your expertise, time, and guidance. Thank you, Steve.With that said, I'll turn the call over to Steve to review the financial results of the quarter.Stephen ParkThanks, Amber, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen for some time now, market and economic uncertainty continue to impact results through the second quarter. Early in the quarter, retail investors remained uneasy about the economy, inflation, and the potential for a recession later in the year.However, as Amber noted, many of our internal metrics are beginning to show signs of improvement towards the end of the quarter, retail investors began to pick up and the stock market officially entered a bull market territory in mid-June. Our business began to reflect some of that improvement in late June as we saw engagement and conversions begin to improve.Of course, a few weeks doesn't make a trend, but we are seeing some green shoots in the landscape of financial publishing. In the second quarter of 2023, our landing page visits were approximately $23 million, up 10% from first quarter 2023 levels. However, our overall conversion rate was approximately two basis points lower this quarter as compared to prior quarter.Looking at this more closely, we saw lower conversion rates earlier in the quarter as market uncertainty and volatility remained high. As the quarter progressed into June, we saw higher levels of engagement with improvement to the point where overall conversion for the quarter was only slightly off from prior quarter. That said, the two basis points decline is relatively small and appears to be moderating based on recent performance.As in the prior quarters, our subscribers have also slowed the pace of buying additional subscriptions given the macroeconomic conditions. So our customers continue to take a bit longer to move through their subscriber journeys with us than historically. However, even in this environment, our high-value and ultra high-value subscribers continue to purchase additional subscriptions.As a result, our active cumulative spend by all subscribers reached another all-time high this quarter. This is just another indication of customer satisfaction and the value that subscribers find in our products, which is why they remain with us for the long-term.Turning to the financials. GAAP revenue was $103.6 million this quarter compared to $128 million for the second quarter of 2022, a decrease of $24.4 million or 19%. The decrease in revenue was driven by a $15.6 million decrease in term subscription revenue and an $8.4 million decrease in membership subscription revenue. Billings were $96.2 million compared to $117.5 million for the year-ago quarter, a decline of $21.3 million.That said, our billings are starting to level out as they only declined $1 million or 1% from the 2023 first quarter. Approximately 36% of our billings came from membership subscriptions, 63% from term subscriptions, and 1% from other billings in second quarter 2023. This compares to 38% of our billings coming from membership subscriptions, 61% from term subscriptions, and 1% from other billings for second quarter 2022.As we discussed in the prior quarter's call, our cost reduction initiative that we completed in 2022 was successful in reducing both run rate, overhead expense and direct marketing expense through the end of 2022. We continue to maintain these levels of efficiency throughout the first half of 2023. While we may begin to see the level of direct marketing expense increase in coming months, this will be in relation to increased landing page visits, conversions, and subscriptions.As we remind everyone, direct marketing is our largest variable expense. And as we see subscriber engagement and the per unit cost of acquisition improve, we may look to increase our direct marketing spend from current levels and focus on subscriber acquisition.As a result of our effort to reduce costs and maintain efficiencies, we were able to improve our overall operating expense profile. On a GAAP basis, total operating expenses were reduced, approximately $9.9 million or 9.5%, as compared to second quarter 2022.Cost of revenue was $14.6 million this quarter, compared to $16.2 million for the year ago quarter, a decline of $1.6 million or 9.8%. This decline was driven primarily by a decrease of $0.8 million in salaries and related benefits expense, a $0.6 million decrease in credit card fees and another $0.6 million decrease in outsourced customer service fees.Sales and marketing costs were $49 million this quarter, compared to $65.1 million in the year ago quarter, a decrease of $16 million or 24.6%. This decrease was primarily driven by a $19.6 million decrease in direct marketing expense related to our cost reduction initiative, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in the amortization of our deferred contract cost acquisitions.General and administrative costs this quarter were $27.6 million, as compared to $20.4 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of $7.3 million. This increase was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in state, franchise and sales tax expenses, a $3.8 million increase in incentive compensation and a $1 million -- $1.1 million increase in stock compensation and a $0.7 million increase in outside labor. This was partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in compensation expense and a $0.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment.Adjusted cash flow from operations was $29 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $26.8 million in the year ago quarter, with the increase primarily due to net income of $9.7 million adjusted for net non-cash items, which increased $5.3 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities, which increased cash by $13.9 million.Adjusted CFFO margin was 30.1% in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to 22.8% last year. As we discussed on our last quarter earnings call, timing of the annual bonus payments made in the first quarter of 2023 impacted our adjusted cash flow from operations margin. Our second quarter adjusted cash flow from operations margin was 30.1%, which was significantly higher than the 4% we reported in the first quarter of 2023.On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted CFFO margin for the first half of 2023 was 17% as compared to 11% for the first half of 2022. As we have discussed in the past, the payment of certain expenses, especially as it comes to royalties and commissions, is not linear and we impact quarter-to-quarter margins. However, we believe the second half of the year, on average, should be consistent with our year-to-date margin for the first half of the year.Our Paid Subscriber base declined from 898,000 at the end of the second quarter 2022 to 750,000 this quarter, a 16.4% decline driven by a decrease in overall consumer engagement. As compared to the first quarter of 2023, our Paid Subscriber base was down 27,000, or 3.5%.During the quarter, Active Free Subscribers decreased by 0.4 million or 9.5% to 3.9 million, compared to 4.3 million as of June 30, 2022. The year-over-year decline in active subscribers is a result of decreased engagement with our subscriber community as consumer engagement continues to be sought. As compared to first quarter 2023, Active Free Subscribers declined 0.1 million or 2.9%.ARPU declined to $490 this quarter from $580 in the second quarter of 2022. This was driven by a 26% decrease in average trailing four-quarter billings combined with a 13% decrease in average trailing four-quarter paid subscribers. We believe the billings decline is primarily due to the volatile economy that's persisted since the first quarter of 2022. As compared to first quarter 2023, ARPU decreased $4 or less than 1%.Last week, we declared a $0.01 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders of our Class A common stock in a dividend equivalent to our holders of our Class B units. We continue to view this dividend as a conservative capital return to our shareholders.Finally, before I turn it back to Amber, I want to emphasize that the hard work we have done on the cost and efficiency side of our operations continues to contribute to the bottom line. Improvement in efficiencies, total operating costs, and our cash flow and adjusted cash flow margins are a direct result of the hard choices we have made over the past year.In addition, we are starting to see some improvement in market engagement, conversions, and subscriber interest in our publications. As we begin to see overall market conditions improve and the self-directed investor return to the market, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to improve the strength of our business.With that, I will turn it back to Amber.Amber MasonThank you, Steve. To conclude, I continue to be excited about the opportunity I see every day at MarketWise. Our metrics around consumer engagement and subscriber conversions are beginning to show signs of improvement. Big ideas and products focused on artificial intelligence and global macro themes have gained traction in recent weeks, and market sentiment is starting to shift in our favor.As I look at our current situation, I'm pleased to see our business model has proven itself once again. When faced with volatility and uncertainty in the markets, we pulled back on our spending and worked to find the next big ideas to help self-directed investors succeed. We successfully navigated that challenging environment and emerged on the other side, profitable and cash flow positive.I look forward to working with our teams to execute on the opportunities ahead of us, continually improve our business model, and deliver increasing shareholder returns to our long-term investors. I know we've said this before, but this truly is a great business, focused on serving the retail investor in a way which we know is both unique and valuable.Our principles define our mission. Deliver great investing ideas to the retail investor. Deliver these ideas written in a way that is easy to understand and execute, and treating our subscribers the way we would want to be treated, if our roles were reversed.I will now turn it over to the operator for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions) Kyle Peterson, Needham.Kyle PetersonGreat. Thanks guys. Good morning and appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to start on Paid Subscribers. Seems like you guys seem a little kind of cautiously optimistic there. It seems like there's some -- a little bit better numbers and engagement in June and July. But just wanted to get your sense like, barring whether -- like if there's a Black Swan event or something in absence of like a negative market event like that, do you guys have some comfort that we might be at least approaching a bottom on paid subs, or is it still a little early to tell?Amber MasonNone of us has a crystal ball, but that's -- I would call us cautiously optimistic. I think you're right. We're looking to see subscriber growth quarter-over-quarter. We can't guarantee anything, but that's where our heads are at.Stephen ParkYes. Kyle, I'd just say that we're definitely starting to see some improvement in some of the metrics and some action is being taken on the subscriber side. So as Amber said, it's early yet, but it feels like we're getting some traction that we didn't have, let's say, six months ago.Lee HarrisYeah, Kyle and we've also seen churn starting to work in our favor. Our churn rate was down from where it was in the first quarter of the year. And it looks like, at least in the short-term, we're going to continue to have that churn rate stay low. So, that's one part of the equation.The other part, obviously, is new subscriber acquisition. We did see a slight increase in subscriber acquisition in the second quarter. And we have a couple of weeks of good results here in July, we just have to see if that continues.Kyle PetersonOkay. That's great color. And then just a follow-up on cash flow. Good to see the step up in cash flow margins this quarter. It sounds like in the second half, I guess, they should be relatively consistent with first half. But I guess just thinking about that, obviously, the 1Q versus the 2Q cash flow margins were quite a bit different. Is thinking of somewhere in between, is that like a good way to think about it? Or maybe are we closer to the 2Q level given that 1Q had the product payment impact?Amber MasonWell, I think that we were forecasting something similar for the second half of 2023, it's hard to know, quarter-to-quarter, there are impacts that are a little bit uneven. And also as we increase the subscriber acquisition, that might impact our results as well. But if -- Lee, you got any more to add to that?Lee HarrisYeah, Kyle. So, we are -- we do tend to be lumpy a bit in that. And the first quarter had our annual incentive payouts, which is kind of a double whammy, but we do pay out some royalties and commissions in Q3. And we're trying to get that [level] out, so we're not as choppy.But generally speaking, the first quarter and the third quarter are going to tend to be on the lower side, the second quarter and the fourth quarter are going to tend to be on the higher side. But I think the best way to really look at it is to look at the half year. And again, we think that the second half of the year is going to look a lot like the first part of the year, maybe with a slight upside to it.OperatorDevin Ryan, JMP Securities.Michael FalcoHi. This is actually Michael Falco on for Devin. Good morning. I wanted to start by touching on the content strategy. Launched 50 new publications in the quarter, and Amber, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks talking about figuring out how to talk to prospective subscribers again.And so I know you mentioned AI, but can you provide any additional insight around maybe what specific types of content are working, driving conversions, attracting new members, and resonating with existing subscribers in the current environment? And then perhaps, on the other hand, what content maybe has been less effective?Amber MasonGreat question. It's one of the most important questions in the business. So AI in all of its magical different forms is absolutely intriguing our subscribers. So we've got products that are using AI to help predict, to help generate stock recommendations. We've got products that are talking about how to invest in AI. We've got products that can give you the best stocks in any sector. Let's talk about the best stocks in AI. So the AI flavor, we're seeing it throughout MarketWise.A couple of other themes that have been interesting for our subscribers is global macro, which sort of is hard exactly to define, but the idea of dangers to the US dollar and how to protect yourself from that. It's a perennial theme in newsletters and that's something that is generating subscriber interest as well. And then we're also seeing increased interest in all different kinds of software to help assist you in managing your own portfolio and to help you trade.Michael FalcoThanks. That's great context. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on M&amp;A. Any context on the types of opportunities you're seeing there and what your appetite is for acquisitions at the moment?Amber MasonWe have been and continue to be very active looking for potential M&amp;A opportunities. I can tell you that we've kissed a lot of frogs over the last year. We found a few princes, but nobody that we're ready to walk down the aisle with. So we are open to interesting ideas, but we're extremely disciplined about our approach. We want to make sure that it is additive for shareholders and not that we're doing M&amp;A for the sake of doing M&amp;A.OperatorJason Helfstein, Oppenheimer.Hey, thanks. This is Chad on for Jason. So I just wanted to hit on kind of the first question. So you talked about churn declining in the quarter. And it does look like your sequential subscriber losses did get better. But Schwab's daily active trades got worse in 2Q versus 1Q. So is that something we should be kind of paying less attention to going forward now? And then I have a second question.Amber MasonOkay. I'm going to toss the Schwab question to Lee, who keeps a closer eye on it.Lee HarrisYeah. So Schwab had a little bit of a strange nuance in the first quarter. We had that little mini bank run where we had a couple of banks fail. So there was a lot of cash outflows. So the Schwab debts kind of peaked in the first quarter and then they kind of declined in the second quarter back to kind of where they've been trending since the back half of 2022.And we had an increase this quarter. And Schwab, although, it didn't kind of see -- it did not translate in the second quarter, Schwab debts have come up in July. So they appear to be lagging or it's just a little bit. But I think that first quarter increase on their part was an anomaly due to these mini bank runs.Stephen ParkYeah. That increase in debts wasn't going to translate into new subscribers for us, we thought. And so I think that you level it all out and kind of look to fourth quarter to now, it makes a lot more sense.Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then I know you don't guide, but it sounds like we're getting incrementally more positive on the go-forward outlook. Does that mean that revenue can grow sequentially from here, or still not sure yet?Amber MasonLike you said, we don't guide, but that's something -- bringing on new subscribers is a great thing. It is the beginning of all things. Revenue might lag a bit, because it takes a while for folks to work through our funnel and start buying the higher-priced products. But as new high-quality subscribers come on, we absolutely expect to see revenue increase.Lee HarrisI was just going to say, so revenue definitely has a lag versus billings. So we amortize the revenue, or the revenue comes off of our balance sheet over the life of a subscription. So we could have several straight quarters of increased billings, but the GAAP revenue is going to take much longer than that to catch up to it. So again, we don't give guidance, but I don't think we're going to see a rapid escalation of our GAAP revenue. It certainly wouldn't escalate as quickly as our billings may.Stephen ParkAnd just to finish on that, it's really important to realize that if we start to bring more people to the top of the funnel, as Amber just mentioned, the life cycle of our customers is quite long. And that first sale may be additive to some point, but it's really that second and third sales. So the longer and deeper the relationship with us is, the more we'll see that revenue build over time.Amber MasonSomething really important to keep in mind is that very little of the current period GAAP revenue is actually earned in the period. So if you're looking for revenue that was earned in the period, billings is the metric to look at.Operator(Operator Instructions) Alex Kramm, UBS.Alex KrammYeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just another one on the cost side. I'm not sure if I heard you correctly there, but I think you said, you continue to evaluate or take cost actions. So maybe you can flesh this out a little bit more. Are you basically -- are you still doing things? If you're doing anything, please, can you let us know what you're doing and maybe dimensionalize a little bit, or given the improvement here, are you a little bit slowing down those maybe other cuts that you have planned?Amber MasonSo I think we still have efficiencies to find in our centralized operation, and those will be iterative rather than slash-and-burn. As we get better at being a public company, we will become more efficient at providing the services that we need to provide at a lower cost. And we can bring some functions in-house that right now we're paying consultants to do for us, which could save us some money.And then -- but we're always looking to improve efficiencies One of the things to know on the cost side is as we increase our direct marketing, we will be increasing our direct marketing spend. But the reason why we dialed it back and the reason why we would dial it up is based on efficiency. We dialed it back, because it was inefficient spend. As we start to see great metrics, we'll be dialing that up.Alex KrammNo, it makes sense. And then maybe just to come back to maybe the second quarter and also what we've seen so far, you gave a lot of detail around some of the metrics that are improving. I think growth in subscribers, up 11% relative to the first quarter was one that stood out to us.But when you just look at maybe markets being really strong in the second quarter and sometimes that brings retail investors back to engage like, what are the things that you would point to for existing -- for both existing and new investors, that's really stood out? And maybe anything you know from history in terms of like maybe it actually takes a little bit after like a big quarter that we just had. So I know it's a broad question, but really, any more detail you haven't provided so far on both the new and existing site that kind of stood out and can service as a good preamble of what to come?Amber MasonOkay. I'll take a shot at that, and then if anybody has anything [smarter] to add, they can. One thing to keep in mind about our business is often that retail investors are a little bit slower than institutional investors to catch on to a trend. So if you start to see institutional investors move into a sector or move into the market overall, retail investors can take a little bit longer to warm up to that idea. So just in general, you might see a little bit of lag in retail investor activity and retail subscriber activity for us.And then I touched on it before, but if there's a hot trend in the market like AI and our retail investors are hearing about it in the news and they're talking to their friends about it and their friends are doing things with ChatGPT, that echo chamber effect works in our favor if we're speaking to that same trend.Stephen ParkYeah. The other thing I would say, Alex, is one of the things we watch, I watch very carefully is our daily orders, especially around the lower price point products. And we are starting to see a little bit of an acceleration there. If you think about our sales funnel, that is the very top of our sales funnel. That's kind of the oil that runs through the engine.So again, I don't want to get kind of over my skis, but we are seeing a positive trend in that. And typically, in our sales funnel, what would happen is those subscribers would see the value in the content that we provide, and they will continue to buy additional subscriptions. And as they move along their journey, these subscriptions become more expensive, and that's where we would start to see a lift in the billings. But it's way too early for us to see that because we're only a few weeks into those orders kind of stepping up just a little bit. So we'll be keeping a close eye on it this quarter.OperatorAnd it appears there are no further phone questions at this time. I will now turn it over for the web questions.Jonathan ShanfieldYeah, thanks so much, Ellie. We've got a couple of questions, Amber. And the first one is on M&amp;A and M&amp;A targeting. The question asks, how do we factor subscriber demographics into acquisition analysis? And we have a -- we tend to have a bit of an older subscription base, so how do you factor that into potential deals?Amber MasonWe absolutely do factor that into potential deals. We are looking for demographics that match our current demographics. We know that those are the kinds of people who buy subscriptions from us and who upgrade and become our long-term loyal subscribers. So when we're looking at an M&amp;A target, if they have demographics that are substantially different, if they're all Gen Zers, that would give us real pause.It's not that -- we don't want to talk to Gen Z, but we want to talk to the Gen Z cohort who is interested in investment advice, which happens to be sort of a small slice of that. So what we're looking for in M&amp;A acquisitions is something that looks and feels familiar, that we can have really high confidence that they're going to become great subscribers for us.Jonathan ShanfieldThat's great. And then a question that you can start, but I'm sure it's going to end up with Lee, is about the ARPU. How do you balance new acquisition with ARPU, since new acquisitions will typically come in at a lower price point? Do you have a floor in mind? Do you have a thought process about where you see ARPU going?Amber MasonSo I would say, we don't manage to ARPU. New subscribers, new high-quality subscribers are a great thing. We bring them on when we can do that efficiently, when we have confidence that they will pay us back for our costs and then [some].So if we have the great good fortune to be able to bring on a whole lot of those subscribers at once, that could weigh on ARPU, but we would expect ARPU then to rebound as those subscribers work to [drive] our funnel as Lee was describing.Lee HarrisRight. I always say, ARPU is simply math. It's billings and it's subscribers. And right now, we are kind of at an inflection point where we hope both are going to start ticking up. But it is a trailing four-quarter metric, so I just have to remind you of that. So even if we have like a really great quarter, we still have to slog through the prior three quarters, which quite honestly haven't been that great for us.So there's going to be, again, we're talking a lot about delayed effects today. I think we're probably bottomed on our ARPU, but I don't expect a rapid escalation. I think, it will stay steady-ish around where it is and maybe pick up a buck or two or something like that here as we head into the next quarter. And then we'll just have to see how the rest of this quarter's billings kind of play out.Jonathan ShanfieldGreat. All right. One last one since we've been talking about AI. Really, the question is, how do you assess the impact of AI on our business model and are there threats to our business that come out of that? All the things we've heard about in AI.Amber MasonSo I might end up spinning a little gold out of straw here, because we haven't seen the impact yet but I'm super excited about what AI could do on our operations side. I think it could improve efficiencies in customer service and they're already using it in our HR team. We're looking at copywriting. We're looking at editorial production. And it doesn't have to revolutionize how everybody does their job, if we can just get 10% better in a few areas of our business, that will have a major impact.Again, forward-looking statements, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer. But in terms of threats, what I think about is the spectrum of financial information or even publishing in general. You've got information, you've got data, you've got information, you've got news, you've got opinion, you've got analysis, you've got insight, you've got recommendations, and you've got a human connection. So there are a lot of publishing businesses that live down here. And if I were down here, I would be worried.Because I think that's -- it's a commodity. And in fact, the robots are coming, and we'll be able to produce that very efficiently. But as you move up the spectrum, you get closer and closer to human connection. And that's really where we live. That's the value that we bring to our subscribers, that insight analysis idea is that a robot won't be able to generate. Now, robots might be coming for us all eventually, but we will not be the first ones down on the battlefield.Jonathan ShanfieldThat's great. All right.Amber MasonGood to know.Jonathan ShanfieldGood to know. Feels secure. That's all we have from our site.Amber MasonGreat. Well, it's just -- I really appreciate you guys joining me on this webcast. I know it was -- there was some trepidation among the team, so I think you guys did great. And thanks for indulging this experiment, and thanks to the audience for the same. So I hope you guys all have a great day and we'll see you next quarter.OperatorWith that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of gay rights in the US and head directly to 10 Most Gay Friendly Cities in the US.There’s a significant population of gay individuals and couples in the US. A Census Bureau report shows that that there were nearly a million homosexual couple households in the US in 2017 and 51.7% of them belonged to female homosexual couples.The US has been relatively slower to recognize same-sex marriage. In 2015 a supreme court ruling legalized same-sex marriages in all US states. For comparison, the same-sex marriage has been legal in the Netherlands since the year 2000. However, sexual acts between people of the same-sex have been legal since 2003 in the US which was a direct result of the ruling of the famous case of Lawrence vs Texas.The supreme court made some critical rulings ensuring the LGBT people could freely marry in the same-sex and would not be discriminated against for employment, based on their sexual orientation, among others. However, despite constitutional legalization, many homosexual individuals continue to experience social discrimination in some parts of the country, especially in the relatively conservative and religious south.There are many aspects of social life where gay people face discrimination such as housing. According to American Progress, LGBT youth make up 5–10% of the American youth population but make up 20–40% of homeless youth. While some states have protection for the LGBT community in terms of housing, other states are still relatively behind the curve.The social dynamics seem to be working in favor of homosexuality in general. According to a Pew survey, there has been a rising acceptance of homosexuality in the US, with 72% Americans in favor of acceptance in the year 2019, up from 51% in the year 2002.However, current problems faced by the homosexual community has caused many to relocate within the country to more friendly states and cities. This has caused demographics to dramatically change in some parts of the country with gay people representing significant percentage of the population in these areas.Story continuesThere are interesting correlations between the gay population density as well as the cities’ diversity and and the general political leanings. To give you an example, the more diverse and liberal a city, the more gay people being part of their populations according to a paper published in the Journal of Sex Reserach. These cities are usually also far more industrialized which allows for inclusive economic opportunities regardless of race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. For example, companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) are known for their inclusive hiring of employees regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation. So liberal and more industrialized cities play in favor of the LGBT community, particularly homosexuals.The purpose of this article is to list the 23 most gay friendly cities in America.23 Most Gay Friendly Cities in the USPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyOur core axiom is that cities with the highest gay populations is an indirect indicator of the respective cities' friendliness towards them. So we have ranked cities based on number of same-sex couples per 1000 households in ascending order. We have used data from Williams Institute. It is a policy research institute with a focus on sexual orientation and gender identity. It is based at the Law School at University of California, Los Angeles.We have also mentioned the cities’ populations to give readers a general idea about the population of homosexuals around the US. The source for US cities’ population is from the US Census Bureau. We've additionally used another metric to broaden reader-perspective. It’s the 2022 scores from Human Rights Campaign’s Municipal Equality Index (MEI) for different cities. The MEI of Human Rights Campaign (HRC) assigns scores to different cities based on the levels of non-discriminatory legislations and social equality among many other equality metrics for LGBT community.Our methodology is based on city dynamics. Rankings may differ if the respective states' policies are factored in. Also read 20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ Americans.Let’s move down to the list of 23 gayest cities in the US.23.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of -28.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +13.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.84 points to a change of -34.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.16 indicates a change of -35.5% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.14 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -12.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $35.8 billion and $33.45 billion estimates indicate -13.8% and -6.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The outlook of the Long-Term ICRs has been revised to stable from positive, while the outlook of the FSR is stable. These companies are the core U.S. life/health (L/H) insurance subsidiaries of Unum Group (Unum) (headquartered in Chattanooga, TN) [NYSE: UNM]. In addition, AM Best has upgraded the Long-Term ICR to ""bbb+"" (Good) from ""bbb"" (Good) and the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Unum. The outlook of the Long-Term ICR has been revised to stable from positive. (See below for a complete listing of the L/H subsidiaries and the Long-Term IRs.)The Credit Ratings (ratings) reflect Unum’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).The rating upgrades reflect Unum’s improved risk-adjusted capitalization and financial flexibility observed over the 2020-2023 period, previously recognized in 2022 with the revision of the Long-Term ICR outlooks to positive from stable, in conjunction with stable asset quality, strong financial flexibility, and enhanced liquidity. Improved risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), was observed after Unum reinsured a large block of individual disability reserves with a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group. The transaction, which completed in 2021, reduced outstanding reserves at the statutory group and materially improved risk-adjusted capitalization at the statutory group. Financial flexibility was improved through the issuance of $400 million of unissued pre-capitalized securities in 2021 While dividends out of the statutory entities to fully fund a long-term care (LTC) premium deficiency reserve (PDR) are expected to moderate risk-adjusted capital slightly, which remains above the company’s stated long-term target levels. AM Best expects Unum to maintain risk-adjusted capital, as measured by BCAR, at the very strong level over the medium term. Liquidity and financial flexibility are expected to remain elevated over the near term as Unum maintains its balance of unissued pre-capitalized securities and ample cash at the holding company. It also is expected that Unum will maintain financial leverage below management communicated 30% maximum, and likely closer to the year-end 2022 figure of 27%.Story continuesAM Best notes that Unum continues to have exposure to below-investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, as well as a large portion of NAIC Class 2 bonds. Below-investment-grade fixed-income securities represent 57% of capital and surplus as of year-end 2022, and approximately one half of fixed-income securities are NAIC 2-rated. Additionally, Unum has a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans, totaling $2.4 billion, or 64% of capital and surplus. However, these assets performed well through the COVID-19 pandemic with very few credit losses in absolute terms and relative to industry benchmarks. These assets support a block of longer-duration liabilities as part of an asset/liability matching strategy.Reserve adequacy for Unum’s closed block LTC business remains a concern due to the complexity of reserve assumptions. However, near-term operating results have been favorable, statutory reserves have been increased through the funding of the PDR, and GAAP reserves have remained stable. Unum has announced that it will fully fund its LTC PDR in 2023, faster than the 2026 deadline initially agreed to with the Maine regulator. After the PDR is fully funded, statutory reserves will be materially higher than the best estimate GAAP reserves, indicating statutory reserves should be less sensitive to changes in assumptions prospectively.Unum’s operating performance remains strong as sales accelerate and profitability improves post-pandemic. Premium growth was nominal in 2021 but accelerated through 2022 and the first half of 2023 as the sales environment improved post-pandemic. Higher employment and wage inflation contributed to organic growth on in-force blocks of business. Operating profitability continued to improve in 2022 as lower mortality rates positively impacted the life business and a strong labor market combined with internal process improvements materially improved disability results. Investment income continued to contribute positively to both statutory and GAAP earnings in 2022. However, Interest rate driven valuation declines in the fixed income portfolio of $7.0 billion had a significant impact on GAAP equity through other comprehensive income. This impact was only offset partially by $4.1 billion in reserve and deferred acquisition cost adjustments. Unrealized losses on fixed income securities did not materially impact statutory earnings or capital. Results through the first half of 2023 are well ahead of 2022 for premium growth and operating income. AM Best expects strong premium growth through the balance of 2023 and for operating income to meet or exceed pre-pandemic levels over the near term.Unum continues to maintain good market share in its core business lines. The company has a large nationwide distribution network to support new business sales. Revenue and earnings are well-diversified across its employee benefits, voluntary and supplemental product portfolios. Unum has a mature ERM program that is incorporated into capital management, business planning and operations.The Long-Term ICRs have been upgraded to ""a+"" (Excellent) from ""a"" (Excellent) and the FSR of A (Excellent) has been affirmed.

Melone, senior vice president and business development officer for Affordable Housing. ""We're honored to support this model initiative, which addresses Portland's houselessness challenge in a comprehensive and sensitive way.""It's an innovative project backed by a big idea. Along with the financing from U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance, this $25+ million project was the brainchild of Portland's housing authority, Home Forward, and the Urban League of Portland. A 2018 Metro Housing Bond, provided via the Portland Housing Bureau, and funding from Oregon Housing and Community Services, also helped bring the building to life.Hattie Redmond units are all permanent supportive housing (PSH), available for people who are exiting homelessness. The PSH model is considered to be a best practice and a proven strategy that can help stabilize individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Here, referrals come from Coordinated Access, a system created in 2018 in Multnomah County to streamline and provide equitable access to shelter and housing interventions on behalf of low-income and disabled individuals. One of the goals of the development is to reconnect Black individuals to the neighborhood and to each other; supportive services in the building are provided by Urban League staff.Story continues""Hattie Redmond Apartments is a model for how the City of Portland can make progress in housing people more quickly and with thoughtful community engagement,"" said Ivory N. Mathews, CEO of Home Forward. ""This building will provide safe shelter to 60 formerly homeless people in need of culturally specific supportive services. From the location to services offered to building amenities, Urban League of Portland thought of everything. This gives us hope that many more people who have been homeless can- and will-thrive with the right support.""At four stories and 34,000 square feet, Hattie Redmond is on the Yellow MAX line. On the ground floor, residents share a community room/kitchen, conference room and laundry facilities. Individual studios have full kitchens and baths in addition to living space. Floors are hardwood, with cabinetry to match. The building also features original donated artwork from six Black and brown artists adding cheer throughout, including a portrait of Hattie Redmond.""For decades, I've watched our members be priced out and pushed out of neighborhoods that were once stable and welcoming of Black Portlanders,"" said Urban League of Portland President &amp; CEO Nkenge Harmon Johnson. ""We also know that more Black developers and property owners are a necessary part of the solution. For those reasons, the Urban League chose to be co-developers of the Hattie Redmond Building as well as provide wrap-around services for residents.""Over the last three-plus decades, U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance has partnered on 95 affordable housing projects, investing more than $492 million in equity and more than $611 million in lending to create or rehab 9,000+ affordable housing units in the Portland area.Nationwide, U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance provides tax credit investments and syndications, lending and other financial solutions to help create affordable housing, spur economic activity in underserved communities, restore historic buildings, develop renewable sources of energy and strengthen Community Development Financial Institutions.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773586/Hattie-Redmond-Apartments-Welcomes-Some-of-Portlands-Most-Vulnerable-Residents]"

(NYSE:CF) is about to go ex-dividend in just two days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase CF Industries Holdings' shares before the 14th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 31st of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.40 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.60 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that CF Industries Holdings has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of $79.96. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether CF Industries Holdings can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. CF Industries Holdings has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 13% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 12% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see CF Industries Holdings has grown its earnings rapidly, up 52% a year for the past five years. CF Industries Holdings looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. CF Industries Holdings has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid CF Industries Holdings? CF Industries Holdings has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks CF Industries Holdings is facing. For example, CF Industries Holdings has 2 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The following analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the company's value.Unearthing the Intrinsic Value: Is CF Industries Holdings Modestly Undervalued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at.Based on the GF Value calculation, CF Industries Holdings appears to be modestly undervalued. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor.

""We were excited to help find new uses for our end-of-life workwear products.""Working with customers and business partners is a key part of Cintas’ innovation efforts. Collaborative efforts like the project with Honda leverage both extended resources and industry expertise that can identify new solutions and opportunities for products and services – especially when they’ve reached end-of-life.""This project was a unique way to take advantage of a process we already have in place: shredding fibers from end-of-life products for use in new ways,"" said Bryan Colpo, Cintas Director of Merchandising.

CAT, Walmart Inc. WMT, KB Home KBH, Progress Software PRGS and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories RDY.5 Dividend Growth Stocks for Safe and Stable ReturnsWall Street has been caught in feeble trading since the start of August, triggered by the Fed’s hawkish signal, the U.S. credit rating downgrade and U.S. bank downgrades. Weak China trade data and a slowing U.S. job market added to the woes. These compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Caterpillar Inc., Walmart Inc., KB Home, Progress Software and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesMoreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Here are five of the 14 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Caterpillar is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 67 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 37.6%.Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

I will now turn the call over to Reade.Story continuesL. Reade FahsThank you, Angie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. As you likely saw on July 26, we announced our preliminary second quarter financial results in conjunction with the news that our partnership with Walmart will be ending in 2024. This morning, I'll provide some highlights from the second quarter, update you on the progress we're making on our key strategic initiatives with particular emphasis on how we're expanding exam capacity and provide some color on the Walmart transition. Then, Melissa will review our second quarter financial results and 2023 outlook in more detail. As we communicated 2 weeks ago, our second quarter 2023 results were largely in line with our expectations and reflected trends similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. Compared with the second quarter of 2022, we delivered net revenue growth of 3.1% and delivered adjusted comparable store sales growth of 1%. We continue to see strength in our managed care business as well as a further shift in the number of higher income customers who traded into our more value-priced offerings. During the second quarter, we opened 24 new stores and remain on track to open approximately 65 to 70 new stores this year. As I'll discuss later in my remarks, we continue to see tangible results from the execution of our key strategic initiatives. These factors, among others, that Melissa will discuss resulted in adjusted diluted EPS of $0.17 for the second quarter. Importantly, we believe the adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS will be at or above the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 guidance ranges. Regarding our Walmart relationship,, as we detailed it in our July 26 press release, as of February 23, 2024, we will no longer be managing the 229 vision centers in select Walmart locations, nor will we be providing our related optometric services for Walmart in California. Consequently, we made the decision to end the wholesale distribution and e-commerce contact lens services that we provide to Walmart and Sam's Club to our AC Lens business when our contract ends on June 30, 2024. While we did not expect this decision from Walmart, for well over a decade, we've been focusing on growing our 2 larger, more strategic brands, America's Best and Eyeglass World, driving the revenue from Walmart stores down to about 8% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. We've created a dedicated transition team and over the coming months, it will be focused on executing a successful transition of the vision centers we operate to Walmart. In addition, we are focused on ensuring we align our cost structure with our go-forward business model and expect to provide more details on this when appropriate. As we look ahead, as a less complex and more streamlined organization, we will be able to have even greater focus on the core strategic initiatives that will grow our 2 large growth brands and return to a mid-single-digit adjusted operating margin milestone while solidifying our leadership position in the marketplace. We continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives, which underscores our confidence in our ability to adapt our business to thrive in this new and evolving environment. Our primary strategic focus has been on expanding exam capacity. In Q2, as in Q1, the stores that achieved our capacity goals produced positive comparable sales growth above our reported consolidated comp. We are laser-focused on improving coverage and are making progress on this front. One example is in dark stores where there is no in-store optometrist coverage or remote exam enablement. In America's Best, dark stores were at their highest level in the second quarter of 2022, and are now at less than half that even while we have increased our store base. We are also focused on improving coverage in our dim stores, which are generally stores with some coverage, but well below our desired levels. The number of dim stores can fluctuate throughout the year. We've been attacking coverage and continue to attack it through recruiting and retention efforts and deployment of our remote technology. We also continued to drive increased exam capacity through retention of existing optometrists in our network, recruitment of new optometrists to our network and deployment of our remote medicine capabilities. We believe that the increase in flexible scheduling options that we now offer to new and existing optometrists is one of the key drivers of improved recruitment and retention levels. We're pleased that we remain on track to deliver a second consecutive year of improved retention rates as we work towards returning to retention levels at or above where they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we're pleased this year's student recruitment efforts are shaping up to be another record year. We believe the flexible scheduling options offered to graduating optometrists were a key driver of the increase in new graduates joining us. Now more than ever, new and experienced health care professionals want more control over their schedules, including how and when they decide to practice. Scheduling flexibility, combined with other incentives is resulting in strong levels of interest by new graduates and experienced optometrists in joining the optometrist network since we launched changes to our recruitment approach and benefits earlier this year. Another driver of expanding exam capacity is the continued rollout of our remote medicine technology. Year-to-date, through July 1, we deployed remote in nearly half of our 200 targeted locations, mainly in our America's Best locations. And remain on track with our rollout target this year. Notably, more than 40% of our 926 America's Best locations are now enabled with both our remote and electronic health record platform. We're deploying remote in tandem with electronic health record technology as the 2 work together to drive expanded capacity, improve in-store efficiencies and importantly, improve the patient experience. The combination of these 2 initiatives is resulting in added exam capacity in sales that we would not have had otherwise. And we remain on track for remote to be EBITDA profitable in 2023. Many optometrists enjoy practicing via a remote setting, which helps support both recruitment and retention efforts. While still in the early innings of our remote program, we remain confident in its ability to continue to expand exam capacity over time, thereby allowing remote optometrists to serve even more patients. As we look ahead, we are focused on carefully navigating the evolving and complex state regulatory landscape in future deployment phases. Before I conclude and turn the call over to Melissa, there are a couple of other recent highlights that I want to touch on. First, and as we mentioned in our first quarter earnings call in May, we recently undertook a study of our pricing architecture to complement the internal pricing analysis we do on a regular basis. This study was recently completed. And while still early in our evaluation of the findings, we're already implementing some modest non-headline adjustments. Second, we are currently in the midst of back-to-school season, which is our second largest selling season after the first quarter when health benefit plans reset and customers receive tax refunds. During back-to-school season, children are getting eye exams and glasses in preparation for returning to school, and we can currently see a seasonal increase in adult customers. As has been our historical practice prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, over the past several weeks, we conducted robust in-person back-to-school meetings across the country with our store teams where we listen to our customer-facing associates to ensure we're providing them with everything they need to best serve our patients and customers. We are reinforcing our focus on our field management to improve operations and thereby improve performance. As we look ahead, we remain encouraged by the progress we're making across the business with execution of our strategic initiatives. While our model is evolving, we remain focused on our mission to help people by making quality eye care and eyewear more affordable and accessible. I'll now turn the call over to Melissa for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Melissa?Melissa RasmussenThank you, Reade, and good morning, everyone. As you know, 2 weeks ago, along with the news that our partnership with Walmart will be ending in 2024, we announced preliminary second quarter results that were largely in line with our expectations and reaffirmed our fiscal 2023 outlook as we previously communicated on our first quarter earnings call in May. For the second quarter, net revenue increased 3.1% compared with the prior year's quarter. The timing of unearned revenue negatively impacted revenue growth in the period by 90 basis points. We opened 21 new America's Best and 3 Eyeglass World stores and closed 1 store in the second quarter. Unit growth in our America's Best and Eyeglass World brands increased 5.1% on a combined basis over the total store base last year, and we ended the quarter with 1,381 stores. As Reade mentioned, we are still on track to open between 65 and 70 stores in 2023, consistent with our previous guidance. Adjusted comparable store sales grew 1% compared to second quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in average ticket and an increase in customer transactions supported by the continued strength in our managed care business. As a percentage of net revenue, cost applicable to revenue increased 120 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. As we expected, we continue to see deleverage of optometrist-related costs. However, this was partially mitigated by an increase in exam revenue driven by managed care strength and pricing actions. The net impact from deleverage of optometrist-related costs and the increase in exam revenue was approximately 50 basis points and in line with our expectations. In addition, we experienced a 50 basis point headwind due to reduction in other components of service revenue, including decreased warranty plan revenue. Lastly, the remaining 20 basis point increase was associated with an increase in contact lens product costs, which was partially offset by additional pricing actions as well as favorability with freight expense management. As a reminder, for the year, we initially expected a gross margin headwind of approximately 100 basis points balance between higher product costs and investments in doctors. Given the mitigating actions we are taking across both product costs as well as overall service costs, we now believe it is best to look at this breakdown as a split between product cost and overall service costs. which include investment in doctors. Given our year-to-date results and expectations for the remainder of this year, we now expect the 100 basis point gross margin headwind for the full year to be skewed to service cost versus product cost. Adjusted SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll and performance-based incentive compensation as we expected and higher occupancy, partially offset by other expenses. As a reminder, we expected adjusted SG&amp;A to grow in the high single-digit range in the second quarter, but saw a slightly lower increase due to the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to incur in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 1.3% to $24.9 million from the prior year period, primarily due to a shift in cloud-based software investments that are amortized in SG&amp;A, partially offset by our ongoing investments in remote medicine technology and new store openings. Adjusted operating income was $16.4 million compared to $27.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 3.1%, driven primarily by the factors discussed as well as the $3.5 million negative impact from the margin on unearned revenue in the period. Net interest expense was $1.8 million, which includes mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative instruments and changes related to amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs of $1.3 million. The year-over-year decline in net interest expense was primarily due to income on cash balances and higher derivative income, partially offset by higher term loan interest expense. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 4.7%. As we move into the second half of 2023, we continue to expect our tax rate to be more in line with our full year guidance of 26% to 28%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year period. Turning to our financial results for the 6 months to date, as compared with the prior year period, net revenue increased approximately 5%, driven by new stores and adjusted comparable store sales growth of nearly 1%. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by the aforementioned factors that impacted the second quarter. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong. During the second quarter of 2023, we successfully refinanced our term loan and revolving credit facility, extending our access to $300 million in liquidity through the revolving credit facility for an additional 5 years through June 13, 2028. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $254.6 million and total liquidity of $548.3 million, including available capacity from our revolving credit facility. As of July 1, our total debt outstanding was $565.7 million and for the trailing 12 months through July 1, 2023, we ended the period with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 1.9x. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $112.2 million. In addition, for the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, we invested $54.1 million in capital expenditures, primarily driven by investments in new stores, our lab and distribution center, and our remote medicine technology. We remain on track for capital expenditures to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million in 2023 to support our key growth initiatives. Moving now to a discussion of our 2023 outlook. Consistent with what we communicated on July 26, with the exception of our outlook for depreciation and amortization expense, we are reaffirming our previous guidance ranges for fiscal 2023. Our revenue guidance continues to incorporate ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives focused on expanding exam capacity as well as a range of scenarios pertaining to consumer sentiment. We believe we are well within our provided range and well-positioned to deliver on the expected sales trend improvement in the back half supported by the timing of new doctors joining and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. We now expect depreciation and amortization to be in the range of $99 million to $101 million given lower depreciation in the first half of this year, the timing of capital expenditures and the anticipated impact of the intangible asset impairment related to the Walmart exit. In addition, we expect adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance ranges of $48 million to $66 million and $0.42 per share to $0.60 per share, respectively. Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes approximately 79 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Finally, with respect to our relationship with Walmart, as Reade discussed, Walmart's contribution to our overall revenue and EBITDA has declined over time, in large part due to our efforts to grow America's Best and Eyeglass World. Consistent with what we communicated 2 weeks ago, when we announced the ending of our relationship with Walmart, for fiscal 2023, we expect the EBITDA contribution from Walmart to be lower in fiscal 2023 than fiscal 2022. We also expect to record noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $60 million and $10 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Given the termination of our Walmart relationship, we are taking a close look at our cost structure and remain committed to making the necessary changes to align it with our go-forward operating model. We believe through the elimination of the direct and indirect costs associated with these businesses, combined with our growth in America's Best and Eyeglass World brands, we will be able to mitigate the financial impact from exiting these agreements. We expect to share more on these plans as appropriate at a later date. As we look ahead, our focus remains on operational execution, delivering further progress on our strategic initiatives and returning to mid-single-digit adjusted comparable store sales growth and mid-single-digit adjusted operating margin. Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Reade for closing remarks before we open the call to your questions. Reade?L. Reade FahsIn closing, let me summarize. Our second quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, where we have achieved our exam capacity goals, we've delivered positive comparable store sales growth in excess of our overall consolidated growth. Retention trends are encouraging, recruitment trends are encouraging and remote is expected to be EBITDA profitable this year and poised to be an ever more important part of our exam capacity. We are reiterating our full year 2023 outlook with adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS to be at or above the midpoint of their respective full year guidance ranges. And we look forward to being a far simpler, faster-growing company with an increased focus on our 2 strategic growth brands, America's Best and Eyeglass World. Thank you for your time today. We will now open the call for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneI just wondered if you could provide any more detail behind the same-store sales trend difference between America's Best and Eyeglass World and the performance there.L. Reade FahsThank you, Kate. I'm happy to do that. Yes. So America's Best was a 1.8% comp and Eyeglass World was a negative 2.8% comp. I've got to tell you, it's a little bit of the same story of managing doctor coverage and dim store. Here, we've really been focusing our efforts with remote, which has been a help so far on our AB stores, our America's Best stores. That's where we've been rolling that out and have that going. And at some point, we will turn to Eyeglass World on that front, but it's really so much the story of capacity constraints there, but we do believe that we can continue to improve those over time.Melissa RasmussenAnd Kate, I just wanted to add, we did talk about dark stores in our prepared commentary this quarter. And as far as the dark stores go, this is something that we are really focused on working through with our remote enablement but the dark stores were at their worst at second quarter of 2022 at mid-single digits, and we're less than half that amount currently. And so we'll continue to attack that through our recruiting and retention efforts as well as our remote. And I'm sorry, those numbers that I quoted were the percent of America's Best fleet. Now that is something, like I said, that we are working to attack through recruiting remote and we'll move to the Eyeglass World brand once we have established our increases with America's Best.L. Reade FahsAnd finally, Kate, I think the real story here is as we have been improving the capacity in America's Best. We're seeing the comps improve. And as we said in our remarks, where we have the desired level of capacity, we are able to deliver the comps in line with our historical operating model. So it's just getting back to making sure we have the exams available for the patients who want to take advantage of them.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserThank you so much for taking our question. Reade, Patrick, Melissa, Angie, there are so many moving pieces in your model given what's happened over the last few years along with now the divestiture of the Walmart business. So it would be extremely helpful if you could help unpack whether or not National Vision can get back to the average adjusted operating income margin that it regularly achieved prior to the pandemic which was in the 6.5% to 7% range. And if that is feasible, what are going to be the key factors and strategies that allow National Vision to get there? Is it simply just going to be a function of generating consistent same-store sales growth, leveraging expenses, especially in light of the investments that you're having to make in order to attract and retain optometrists at this point?L. Reade FahsMichael, I love your question, and there are a few moving pieces really brought on by the post-COVID marketplace. And those moving pieces are affecting the optical category in general. Again, what I'd like to remind you is where we are able to execute our model, where we have capacity, we are driving the comps in line with our historical model. We do believe that mid-single-digit adjusted operating income margin is our next milestone, and we've been talking about how we will get back to that and hope to be back there certainly in 2025 and start seeing that in late 2024. I'll say the elimination of the Walmart part of our business, that was pulling down our margins. So that alone is going to help with that. And we see that expansions in capacity are a key driver in helping us to get there, but also the digitization of our stores, further digitization of our corporate office, more leveraging of omnichannel capabilities, as well as more stores as we take advantage of our white space opportunity. I'll add Michael that since you've been following us so long, at this time last year, I'd say we were sort of feeling more back-footed by a lot of changes that were affecting us and coming our way and sort of coming to understand to the full extent what was happening both to our consumer and the rising inflation environment and to the doctor capacity within the marketplace also. We are feeling far more front-footed now with the programs we put in place, especially flexibility in terms of driving increased and improved retention. And frankly, we think our retention will be at maybe the best year post -- the best year post-COVID and record recruitment of students and the like. And we're encouraged with the start of the third quarter. It's a back-to-school season and back-to-school season does evolve across the country. So it starts more in the Southeast and then goes North and then across the country, but where it has started, we are encouraged by the initial trends we are seeing there.Michael LasserOkay. My follow-up question is that it's clear the purchase cycle for new eyewear had been disrupted over the last couple of years given all that's going on. And now, as you mentioned, you're on front-footing, more firmer footing. And is what you're seeing a sign that there is a return to normalization of the optical purchase cycle? Or is it more of a sign that National Vision is gaining or retracing some of the share that it might have lost over the last years as it was contending with some of the constraints that we're dealing with?L. Reade FahsI think it's a sign of our improved capacity allowing us to offer patients the exams they want to get from us. We have not yet seen a normalization in the purchase cycle. It could start to happen in the second half, but we are not planning for that. It could start to happen in the second half. It's been about 2 years since that big boom of optical purchases for us and others that came about when the government gave out so much money to our customers. So it's been about 2 years. So there is a logic that, that could happen, but we are not planning for that in our guidance. We are planning that the improved capacity is going to be helping us in the second half. We believe our market share is flat to up and maybe more up in the managed care segment.OperatorOur next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.Anthony Chinonye ChukumbaThanks for all the helpful information that you shared so far this morning. I guess my question was on dark stores and dim stores. I just want to make sure I have this correct. So a dark store is not offering any eye exams and a dim store is offering some but not at sort of 100% capacity. Is that the right way to think?L. Reade FahsYes. At dark, we do not have a doctor, and we do not have remote. So yes, we can't get an eye exam there. And a dim store has maybe a day, maybe a couple of days, but not at our desired level.Anthony Chinonye ChukumbaGot it. And so I think it's pretty safe to say that your dark stores here and dim stores are doing comps that are significantly lower than company average. Is that a fair assessment?L. Reade FahsYes, for sure. And especially those dark sales, they are quite a quite a drag. And again, the fact that we've cut the dark stores in half as a percentage of our fleet since the low about this time last year. We're pretty proud of that. We think that shows nice progress and also remote is helping to ever more exams in those -- in the remote-enabled stores. But yes, and the converse of what you said, Anthony, is where we're able to deliver our model, where we are able to offer the eye exams that comps are doing what they were doing historically prior to COVID. And that's encouraging, too. What it says is, hey, deliver the model and the patients show up for you like they used to.Anthony Chinonye ChukumbaGot it. And just one last question. I don't want to bogart the Q&amp;A session here. But -- okay, when you say, mitigate the financial impact of losing the Walmart partnership, are you talking about -- are we mitigating that impact, like literally getting the recapture of the $19 million of EBITDA? Is that the way to think about it? Or is it like sort of partially mitigating that?Melissa RasmussenAnthony, it's Melissa. When we're talking about mitigating the impact of Walmart, we do understand that there is a profit hole to fill. And so we're going to mitigate that through 2 avenues. First being the continued increase store count as we expand our America's Best and EGW fleet and the other portion of that will be through cost reductions related to the Walmart exit. There's both indirect costs associated with that indirect costs associated with that, that we'll be taking out of our business. In addition, we're committed to rightsizing the structure of our go-forward model to the new operating model that we have, which is a less complex operating model now that we'll be exiting the Walmart relationship.OperatorOur next question comes from Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo.Richard Samuel ReidThis is Sam Reid pitching in for Zach here. Wanted to touch on your ongoing relationship with EssilorLuxottica. How does the Walmart contract change -- or the change in the Walmart contract impacted us, if at all? And is there a risk of the reduction in your volumes post the Walmart exit could be a headwind to this relationship?L. Reade FahsI think we have a very strong long-term relationship with EssilorLuxottica and we have long-term contracts in place on the lens side, and we talked about last year, how that's a fixed price through the length of the contract there. And we are still -- even without Walmart, we are one of the top couple largest optical chains in America. And so we're still a big customer and a big partner, but that relationship goes back a long way and a lot of it is contractual, and we are not anticipating any significant change in that.Richard Samuel ReidThat's super helpful. And then one quick follow-up if I could. Can you walk us through some of the non-headline price actions you've taken thus far in a bit more detail? It doesn't sound like they've really impacted transactions. So are there any specific areas where you might have additional runway in 2H and beyond?Melissa RasmussenSam, it's Melissa. So we have taken price actions where we have been able to increase that weren't originally contemplated in our guidance. As we have seen continued cost increases, we evaluate the price increases to follow that. Now some of the things that we've been able to look at for this year specifically, our private label contact lenses, for example, and some ancillary exam add-ons. Those are 2 of the major areas that we've been able to contemplate and increase additional price actions.OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.Brian Gil TanquilutI guess just to follow up on some of the Walmart questions. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to maybe some cost adjustments that you're contemplating. Just curious what those are and the timing and the magnitude of cost opportunities that you think you can realize over the next 12 to 24 months.Melissa RasmussenBrian, it's Melissa. With the Walmart information that we've put out, we're ending the Walmart relationship with the stores in February of '24 and with the distribution contract in June of '24. We are assessing and evaluating our opportunities to exit those cost structures at the same time that we'll be exiting the revenue stream. So we're going to marry those up as closely as possible. That's what our planning is working on. And the costs that will come out of the business are, of course, any direct costs related to supporting those relationships. And in addition, with the corporate structure, you have back-office costs. You have overhead related to things, in the last discussion we said like insurance, things like that. Those are types of indirect costs tied to Walmart relationship and the distribution relationships that would look different in the go-forward model than they do today.Brian Gil TanquilutGot it. Okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you also alluded to the fact that you rolled out virtual to about half of the target stores. Anything you can share with us in terms of the performance that you're seeing or the ramp that you're seeing as some of these rollouts mature? Or -- I think for some of them, you're probably not quite a year but close to a year out now. So just curious what you're seeing.Patrick R. MooreSure. We're very encouraged by what remote is doing for us. Reade mentioned earlier in the dark and dim conversation where it's been kind of a game changer even from a new store rollout perspective this year. We've even opened some new stores where we haven't found an inline doctor yet with a remote doctor. So I look back on our decision to start pursuing remote 3 years ago, and really happy with that timing because it's playing a pretty big role. You're right. We've rolled this out to other -- to about 40% of our AB brand. Now we're higher than that. We're going to have 500 of ABs equipped by the end of the year this year. We're evaluating our 2024 plans now, but we expect to continue to be rolling this out to a vast majority of our ABs over time. And I think more recently, we're going to start. We've started testing it in more surgically in EGW, where I think it can be a benefit there as well. So we're on track with remote. And then finally, I would say our wording has been we expect it to be EBITDA profitable this year, and there's -- there couldn't be higher confidence around that.OperatorOur next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Michael VuThis is Michael Vu on for Adrien. So I wanted to start off with a more broad question. I know that you mentioned that you saw higher average ticket and an increase in customer transactions. Would you please share some additional color around why you're seeing consumers buying higher ticket? Is this maybe attributable to the new store openings and the additional capacity? Or are you also seeing any kind of trade-down effects?Melissa RasmussenMichael, it's Melissa. So there are a couple of factors tied to the higher ticket, but first and foremost being the managed care strength that we're seeing. Managed care customers tend to have a higher ticket than the nonmanaged care customers just based on spending somebody else's money versus spending your own money. In addition to that, we have seen a continued trade down from the income levels of higher than $100,000. And with both of those factors combined that's what's driving the higher ticket. We provide value to many customers. And with the continued managed care strength, where we believe that they come to see our stores because they get more value for their benefits in our stores.Michael VuPerfect. And as a follow-up to that, I know that you just mentioned the higher household income. And as we are like starting to shortly see the repayment of student loans, I was just wondering whether or not that's going to be positive or accretive related to the increase in customer transactions in the overall business. Or are you more seeing that as a headwind? And what kind of assumptions are you making related to that if any at all since you were just mentioning the $100,000 to $125,000 range?Melissa RasmussenSo related to the student loans, while there may be a broader consumer sentiment implication, we do expect that with the higher income bands, we'll likely see some additional trade down into our brands because of the value that these consumers can get at shopping at one of our stores. Now our target customer -- our data shows us that a smaller portion of our target consumer has student loan debt.OperatorOur final question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.Dylan Douglas CardenJust curious if you might be willing to express explicitly of the data you provided on the Walmart business, it's accretive from an EBIT net income standpoint. And is the idea here that through indirect cost reductions, ultimately you'll be able to mitigate kind of the margin implications of losing that business next year?Melissa RasmussenDylan, it's Melissa. Yes, you are correct that Walmart is accretive at the EBIT level. It will take some time to fill that profit hole. However, that has been a declining portion of our business over the past couple of decades as we've grown our America's Best and Eyeglass World brands. And we continue to expand our fleet so that is a factor in the growth. In addition, the Walmart business has lower margins than what our growth brands have. So through cost reductions in addition to new store openings, we'll continue to fill that profit hole. If we weren't in an intensive investment cycle on our growth brands, you wouldn't have seen as much of an accretive margin -- or I'm sorry, an accretive profit hole that we needed to fill because you would have seen more of the margin drop down to the bottom line based on our growth brands, but our investment cycle is a factor in that currently.Dylan Douglas CardenSo if you were to dial it back to '18, '19 pre-pandemic, you would see the Walmart business be dilutive on the EBIT line? Is that what you're saying?Melissa RasmussenI'm not saying you would see it to be dilutive on the EBIT level. You would just see it as a lower portion of our overall profit.Dylan Douglas CardenOkay. And then with the doctors that are coming out of the Walmart stores, stores in stores. Can you kind of speak to the capacity for you to retain those doctors, maybe deploy them across the fleet? Any comments there about what that might actually do from a capacity standpoint?L. Reade FahsYes. Our contract has a transition period where various groups are able to talk to the doctors there. It's sort of a complex thing because it relates to sort of state-by-state, location-by-location, doctor-model-by-doctor-model, but doctors are going to be making a variety of choices based on the stake.Dylan Douglas CardenSo it's not sort of an immediate windfall, I guess. We should back away from thinking that it might be from a capacity utilization.L. Reade FahsI don't think we should think of it as an immediate windfall. You've got to have a new store nearby if a doctor wants to shift over a similar model piece. So I wouldn't say an immediate windfall, but it will be -- yes, doctors will be making various decisions.Dylan Douglas CardenGreat. And then last question on the pricing. The reviews over you've kind of taken some action here on the periphery. Is that -- it sounds like there still might be some more that you can do kind of going into the back part of this year into next year. Is that right? And how should we sort of think about -- I know that's just a big focus of a lot of investors here, your capacity to kind of close the gap if you would. Please kind of speak to what you expect in the coming quarters on the pricing, particularly your approach.L. Reade FahsAnd by the way, periphery makes it sound a little smaller. We're thinking nonheadline price. The terms mean the same thing. But yes, we believe that more pricing actions will come into play in the second half of the year. We're very vigilant about pricing. We mentioned the study that's causing us to ask a lot of other questions, too. So we think there is more juice in the pricing lever going forward.OperatorThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Reade for closing remarks.L. Reade FahsThank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and support, and we look forward to speaking to you next on our Q3 earnings call. Thank you all very much.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Well, big name retailers, including Walmart and Target, gearing up to report their quarterly results next week, and it certainly is a tricky year for retailers as they navigate what is becoming a more cautious consumer. So what names should you buy, and what should you sell? We want to bring in James Demmert. He's Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer, along with Brian Mulberry, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager. Great to have both of you.Brian, let me start with you. We talk about the fact that it's a tough environment here for retailers. More and more consumers-- we've seen this trend over the last couple of quarters. More consumers starting to trade down. Walmart is one of your picks. What gives Walmart the edge in this environment?Story continuesBRIAN MULBERRY: As you guys have been talking about, inflation has been a big impact on bottom lines across the board. Just simply the cost of doing business, labor and supply chain issues have made things difficult for a lot of these retailers. But Walmart has been a cash flow generating machine. And the more cash flow that you have, that you can reinvest in your own business without having to leverage right now is going to be a key difference as we go forward.I agree with a lot of the other comments made earlier today in that interest rates are likely just to stay higher for longer than the equity markets currently have priced in. Not that we have a huge disagreement about we might be at the top terminal rate or one more hike to go, but we don't see the rate cuts in the future. That just simply means the cost of doing business in the future continues to stay high.So these companies like Walmart, that continue to generate an enormous amount of cash flow, have that capital to reinvest in themselves organically and grow. And they've done so. They've made huge investments in their e-commerce segment, primarily to combat what they have in terms of direct competition with Amazon. And they're gearing up their home delivery services. And so they're using that cash flow to their advantage in this highly competitive sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So, James, let's pick up on that point. I mean, you know, Brian, looking essentially where consumers are going right now, especially with tighter wallets, talking about cash flow investments in e-commerce, is this a name that you would get in on? How are you looking at the retail space?JAMES DEMMERT: It is a name that we find attractive without question. And one of the few rules that we have, particularly in what I consider a stock picker's market, is the three most important things in retail which is brand management, brand itself, management, and as Brian mentioned, indebtedness.It's very important here that companies have very strong balance sheets and that brand awareness and really, really great management. And I think that's going to be a key issue as we go through the hurdles of stickier inflation and quite some time before the Fed cuts. So we've got a couple names beyond the Walmart that we find very attractive here.SEANA SMITH: And what are those, James?JAMES DEMMERT: The first is, back to our global style, a company like LVMH. Obviously, lifestyles of the rich and famous type of stock. But there again, the one-percenters tend to be pretty consistent through all kinds of economic climates. When we go back to our brand is important, these are probably some of the highest end brands in the world and well known and recognizable. Arnault is probably one of the best managers of a business, and we do buy businesses.And again, debt levels are important. So we want to make sure the company isn't over its skis, let's say, in indebtedness. So really the right mix. And here, you have the stock down about 8% from its high. Really love that as an opportunity to add to the position. Or if investors don't own it, here's a great time to do so.AKIKO FUJITA: James, really quickly. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the announcement that we got today of Capri and Tapestry because we were talking earlier about as much as those companies combined bring in brands under one umbrella, it's still tough to compete with a name like LVMH, which you're invested in.JAMES DEMMERT: I think it is. That's a very good question. And Etsy sort of falls into that same trap, where you've just got too many-- you don't have any brands of significance. You've just got a lot of brands. And I think that's going to be the differentiator for the successful companies over the next 12 months versus the others. So again, I would want to stick again with brand awareness, like a Tractor Supply, which we can talk about as well, has got that very significant presence, as in brand awareness. Really, really important.SEANA SMITH: All right, James, we'll talk about Tractor Supply in just a minute. But Brian, I want to get your thoughts here just on the luxury consumer given the fact that it sounds like you see a lot of the opportunity being at the other end of the market, the lower income market.BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, and it's certainly that we don't acknowledge the luxury brand. There has been a lot of durability there in spending from consumers. And we think a lot of that has to do with the fact most of those higher end, higher income individuals were able to take advantage of the low in the rate hike-- in the rate cycle and refinance usually what is their biggest debt, which is their mortgage. And that has cleaned up their balance sheet. And so their spending has been growing even more so than what you would see in the low to mid-income range.So there's absolutely a reason to have those types of companies in your portfolio. We think it absolutely makes a lot of sense. It doesn't mean that we don't like them. It just means that at this point, we're a touch more defensive, leaning a little bit more on free cash flow and operating income. And there's definitely going to be some consolidation, we think, in those brands that James was just talking about.AKIKO FUJITA: With that said, Brian, we started the conversation by talking about Walmart. There's another name that you actually surprisingly don't like, a direct competitor to Walmart. What's different here when you look at a name like Walmart versus Target?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Target really over the last couple of years has had a difficult time managing their inventory. And they now have a new problem where they just acknowledge that they have $500 million worth of shrink or theft coming out of the stores, and a lot of it is because they have so much on clearance and on sale that's really impacted their margins for a very long time coming out of COVID.And this affected a lot of people trying to get their actual goods landed in stores. And it had a ripple effect when you had a whole bunch of nonseasonable wares in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so they made a decision to try and clear out that inventory and not have to wait on it, but it has impacted their margins to a point where there's a little bit of a capitulation in confidence in the company, and that's starting to get reflected in their margins going forward as well.And so it's not that target is a bad company, they're just kind of stuck in a bad spiral, and they're really going to have to work hard to get out of that. Again, this puts pressure directly on those metrics that we like. Operating income, free cash flow, they've all been in pretty substantial decline over the last three or four quarters. And we don't see it improving until maybe three years from now that they can work themselves out of this particular hole.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Target shares off just about 12% so far this year. James, getting back to what you just said a moment ago, and that's Tractor Supply. You talked about the brand awareness, but this is also a stock that hasn't done much since the start of the year. What's the bull case here for Tractor Supply?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah. It's a stock like many of the stocks outside of the Super Seven tech that has gone a long way this year. And I think that the valuation should be the first thing that's attractive, right? PE, multiple versus growth. Then back to brand awareness. This is the leader in gardening, and even farm equipment, and all kinds of stuff that you'd like to do in the garden.And so one of the things and themes outside of brand awareness, which of course, they're the kingpin, is this incredible move by millennials to the outer parts, the more rural parts of the country and not just here in the United States. So Tractor Supply started in 1938. I mean, they are the brand. They're continuing to open new stores. So you have that expansion growth story.You've got brand awareness, as we talked about before. And wow, do they have high margins and extremely well managed business, as opposed to what Brian mentioned, the Target situation, which is sort of a mismanagement there. On the Tractor Supply, you've got excellent management, great valuation, and you've got that millennial push. They're opening stores. All the right mix of a company that yes, maybe hasn't done tremendously well so far this year but probably will in the back half of this year into 2024.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Brian, let's end on a positive note, sort of staying in the home improvement space. Home Depot, one of those stocks that you say you like. We've seen a bit of a transition in terms of what is driving revenue for Home Depot. We kind of went through the pandemic where there was this huge, huge push in DIY. Since then, it's kind of moved in a different direction. What are you liking what the company is doing right now?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Again, a lot of investments in where future revenue is going to come from at Home Depot. They moved away from that DIY segment and put a lot into their pro development. And these are the licensed contractors, the actual professionals that can come in and do projects for you. And that's been a big transition in their business. The last 20 years, they've been the DIY kings along with Lowe's. But now they've actually made substantial investments in where they see the future of revenue coming from.And there's a bit of a cycle in the consumer here where they absolutely did home improvements on their own. And then the value of their home went up so substantially, they started to sell it and trade up. And now it's coming back around to where people are going to want to have some projects and some improvements done. and Home Depot has by far and away made great investments in being ahead of that curve, so that they can supply the contractors with everything that they need to get those jobs done.And that's important right now because the contractors are making more money now than they ever have been because of the short supply of their skill set and skilled labor. And so being able to have a trusted partner where you can actually work very conveniently with your own personal representative online again in an e-commerce way, go pick up the materials that you need, it makes you more efficient. It makes you able to do more projects that's better for your bottom line and Home Depot. That's why we like them.AKIKO FUJITA: You've given us a lot to think about in the retail space both of you, James Demmert and Brian Mulberry. Good to talk to both of you. Really appreciate the time.]"

It is worth considering Walmart (WMT), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.93%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Walmart came out with earnings of $1.47 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share, representing a surprise of 11.36%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.52 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 12.50%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Walmart lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Walmart currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.38%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 17, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

You can skip our detailed analysis on edcuational stats, and head over directly to the 5 States With The Lowest College Tuition and Fees.Figures released by The US Census Bureau state that by 2021, an estimated 14.9% of the population aged 25 and above had completed some college but not a degree, while 10.5% had completed an associate degree. 23.5% had a bachelor’s degree as their highest level of education, while 14.4% had completed a master’s or advanced professional degree. Another pattern which was noticed was that foreign-born people that had recently arrived in the United States were more likely to have college education than foreign-born who had arrived earlier than them.According to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is a direct relationship between education and earning levels. In 2022, individuals with less than a high school diploma were earning as little as $682 per week, compared to $1,005 for those with a college degree. Income rises as you go higher up in educational attainment. Bachelor’s degree holders make $1,432 on average per week, followed by $1,661 for those with a master’s degree.According to the Annual Survey of Colleges by The College Board, California has the lowest college tuition and fees in the United States, where in-district students paid an average of $1,428 during the academic years 2022-23. Vermont has the highest college tuition and fees, estimated to be $8,660.While state governments across the country take steps to make education more affordable for the public, a number of large corporations in the US are also taking initiatives to promote college education. One such example is that of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which, in 2021, announced to pay 100% cost of tuition, fees, and books for its hourly-wage employees in the US. More than 750,000 employees of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are eligible for this program, which is also likely to help boost the education industry. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has vowed to invest up to $1.2 billion to expand education and skills training benefits to its workforce in the country.Story continuesLast year, AT&amp;T Inc. (NASDAQ:T) spent $10.5 million in tuition assistance for its workforce, which also included non management employees. Nearly 2,500 of AT&amp;T Inc. (NASDAQ:T)’s employees signed up for the tuition reimbursement program. Internal research at the company showed that employees that had attained further education or enhanced their skill-set with new training were more likely to get a new, better job within the organization, compared to employees who had not done so. In addition to this, AT&amp;T Inc. (NASDAQ:T) also offers several discounts for students and teachers in its weekly and monthly wireless plans. Another fine example of supporting education is FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which offers tuition reimbursements worth $5,250 to its ground package handlers, including for college education. Those FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) employees that have attained college education can then go on to study for an exclusive discount at Robert Morris University, which will allow FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) employees to take online classes from anywhere and get a university degree.Retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) also announced in 2021 to invest up to $1 billion over the next five years to cover 100% of college tuition and book fees of its employees under the Live Better U (LBU) Education Program. This would enable 1.5 million Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) associates in the country to earn educational qualifications. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the United States. Likewise, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in the retail industry, also offers its employees up to $21,000 for both part-time and full-time employees in education benefits, for any degree ranging from high school equivalency exam to Ph.D. More than 15,000 associates have participated in the program since its launch in 2018, according to The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR). Earlier this year, the company also announced its plan to invest $770 million to raise hourly wages and improve healthcare offerings for its employees. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the leading financial services companies in the United States. Employees at the company can receive up to $5,000 in tuition reimbursement each year. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) also offers scholarships for dependent children of its employees – ranging between $1,000 and $3,000 per annum. Firms such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) and others discussed in this article help contribute in making education more accessible for the general public. This is in addition to loans and grants offered at governmental level to students in the country.MethodologyWe have ranked states with the lowest college tuition and fees using data released in October 2022 by The College Board in its Annual Survey of Colleges. Average in-district tuition and fees for two-year college programs in public institutions in states across the US were considered.

However, the volatile nature of the investment banking (IB) business and mounting expenses are concerns.Raymond James’ successful business expansion in Europe and Canada over the years positions it well for growth. Its notable buyouts in the last fiscal year include SumRidge Partners, TriState Capital Holdings and the U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. Also, in fiscal 2021, the company acquired Cebile Capital and a boutique investment bank, Financo. These accretive deals are likely to continue supporting its financials. Further, management is aiming for many such acquisitions to bolster its PCG and Asset Management divisions.The PCG segment remains a standout performer for the company. Net revenues for the segment have witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9% over the last three fiscal years (2019-2022). The uptrend continued in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. We project the PCG segment’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 7.8% over the next three years.Raymond James maintains a solid balance sheet position. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had a total debt of $4.87 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $8.38 billion. Given the favorable factors and earnings strength, the company is expected to be able to meet its debt obligations, even if the economic situation worsens.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 26.8% compared with the industry's growth of 14.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, rising expenses remain a major challenge for the company. Its non-interest expenses registered a CAGR of 12.2% over the last three fiscal years (2019-2022). Regulatory changes, inorganic expansion efforts and a highly competitive environment will likely lead to a further increase in expenses in the quarters ahead. We project total non-interest expenses to rise 3%, 9% and 7.6% in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.Also, the current heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties are likely to weigh on IB performance in the near term. During the nine months ended Jun 30, 2023, RJF’s investment banking revenues plunged 49%. Additionally, the company’s heavy reliance on the IB business, which is closely tied to the volatile performance of the capital market, raises our concerns. We project IB revenues to decrease 45.1% in fiscal 2023.Story continuesBanks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are First Community Bancshares FCBC and Bank7 BSVN.

The dividend yield will be 5.2% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable.Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 39%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 9.9% over the next 3 years. However, as estimated by analysts, the future payout ratio could be 47% over the same time period, which we think the company can easily maintain.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.16 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.62. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Huntington Bancshares has been growing its earnings per share at 5.4% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Wall Street ended the first seven months of 2023 on an impressive note after a highly disappointing 2022. However, month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have slid 1.2%, 2.6% and 4.4%, respectively.Recent volatility arises primarily from three sources. First, on Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. The central bank remains open to more rate hikes, depending on economic data.Second, on Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. This resulted in a spike in yields of U.S. sovereign bonds. Third, on Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

Natural gas prices have also climbed recently, driven by fears that strikes in Australia could reduce exports of liquefied natural gas.The upward pressure on oil prices could ease next year. The IEA predicts that demand growth will slow to 1 million barrels per day in 2024 as the post-pandemic recovery will have “largely run its course and as the energy transition gathers pace.”The world’s appetite for oil is likely to peak in the next few years, the agency projected in June, pointing to stricter fuel efficiency standards, growth in the electric vehicle market and structural changes to economies.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

But Russian oil exports held steady at around 7.3 million bpd in July, the IEA said.Next year, demand growth is forecast to slow sharply to 1 million bpd, the IEA said, citing lacklustre macroeconomic conditions, a post-pandemic recovery running out of steam and the burgeoning use of electric vehicles.""With the post-pandemic rebound largely completed and as multiple headwinds challenge the OECD's outlook, oil consumption gains slow markedly,"" the IEA said, referring to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.The IEA's demand growth forecast is down by 150,000 bpd from last month and contrasts with that of OPEC, which on Thursday maintained its forecast that oil demand will rise by a much stronger 2.25 million bpd in 2024.Story continues""The global economic outlook remains challenging in the face of soaring interest rates and tighter bank credit, squeezing businesses that are already having to cope with sluggish manufacturing and trade,"" the IEA said.For 2023, the IEA and OPEC are less far apart.The IEA expects demand to expand by 2.2 million bpd in 2023, buoyed by summer air travel, increased oil use in power generation and surging Chinese petrochemical activity. OPEC sees a rise of 2.44 million bpd.Demand is forecast to average 102.2 million bpd this year, the IEA said, with China accounting for more than 70% of growth, despite concerns about the economic health of the world's top oil importer.(Reporting by Natalie Grover and Alex Lawler in London; editing by Alex Lawler, Jason Neely and David Evans)]"

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.15%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.12%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the customer-management software developer had lost 9.42% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.11% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.66% in that time.Salesforce.com will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 30, 2023. On that day, Salesforce.com is projected to report earnings of $1.90 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 59.66%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.52 billion, up 10.41% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.44 per share and revenue of $34.64 billion. These totals would mark changes of +41.98% and +10.5%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

47,aa8bd910-01e3-38d9-9d91-bdc0a22ce7d8,CRM,2023-08-11,Is It Worth Investing in Salesforce.com (CRM) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-salesforce-com-crm-133005458.html,1691674205,STORY,['CRM'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.9% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CRM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $7.44.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

48,88135d53-3ee7-3329-ac30-d5cdc8d0bd7d,CRM,2023-08-11,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130011119.html,1691672411,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -9.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share, indicating a change of +59.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 points to a change of +42% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.01 indicates a change of +21.1% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.52 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.64 billion and $38.52 billion estimates indicate +10.5% and +11.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We started year 2 of our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan with continued progress on our long-term strategic commitments. Our solid first quarter performance highlights both the power of our iconic brand around the world and our diversified engines of growth. First quarter results exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line in what continues to be a highly dynamic global operating environment. We delivered positive comps, stronger value perception and luxury credentials and targeted ecosystem expansion across our top cities in the period. Our growing brand desirability also drove double-digit AUR growth on top of last year's strong gains. And we will continue to invest in our product quality and sustainability, selling environments and authentic brand messaging to sustain our growth and long-term pricing power in the marketplace. At the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on agility and operational discipline to respond to evolving market dynamics. This enables our operating profit and margin expansion even as we invest for the long term. We continue to be mindful of macro inflationary challenges facing our more value-oriented consumers, particularly in North America. That said, we are more than offsetting softness from this cohort with growth in our full price businesses. Turning to the first quarter, our solid performance was guided by our 3 strategic pillars to drive long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these strategic pillars. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We are investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand, to inspire and engage our consumers, drive brand desirability in the market and ultimately grow lifetime value. We continue to diversify and optimize our marketing across a variety of media and platforms as we deliver a clear, differentiated story to our target consumers in order to trade them in across and up our lifestyle portfolio. During the quarter, first, we drove some of our highest engagements globally through iconic celebrity dressing moments. This was led by Jennifer Lopez at the Met Gala in May, delivering over 8 billion global media impressions and her look landed on multiple best dress lists across TV, digital, social and print outlets. Other celebrity highlights included Taylor Swift, spotted on the streets of New York in our Wellington bag and all white Polo Ensemble; Singer and actress Crystal Young in [Cannes], first lady Jill Biden at the coronation of King Charles, and you may have caught a recent episode of And Just Like That, which features characters Charlotte and Rock outfitted in Ralph Lauren at a fun fictional Polo photo shoot, highlighting the multigenerational appeal of our brand. Second, we have worked to reinforce our luxury lifestyle positioning through iconic lifestyle partnerships and activations in key global cities. We paired our recent Milan flagship openings with key campaigns to fuel excitement in this influential fashion capital this spring. This included the return of men's Purple Label to Milan Fashion Week in June and our second annual participation at Salone del Mobile, part of Milan Design Week, where we showcased our emerging home business. Similarly, across Europe and Asia, we drove brand heat through experiential events like our California Dreaming key city takeovers, exclusive private client events and influencer campaigns to build our presence in both new and existing ecosystems, from Paris to Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul. And most recently, we reinforced our leadership in the world of sports with another successful Wimbledon sponsorship, where we delivered our highest-ever results on social conversations, on-site merchandise sales and global PR impressions. Ralph Lauren truly embodies the heritage and tradition of this iconic tournament. In addition to our beautiful Encore presence, we also captured our iconic spectator style on celebrities and influencers like Ariana Grande and David Beckham, which we amplified globally. Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new high-value consumers to our business.In our DTC businesses, we added 1.2 million new consumers in the first quarter consistent with recent trends. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers. And we reached 53.5 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to outpace our peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories. Moving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Ralph and our design teams continue to create sophisticated timeless products that meet our customers' modern lifestyle, underpinned by the quiet luxury that is a hallmark of our brand.Starting with our iconic core products, which typically represent about 70% of sales and are a consistent driver of our business, season after season. Our core grew mid-single digits in the first quarter, ahead of total company growth and penetration to total sales increased by 350 basis points. underscoring the importance and resilience of our icons through choppier times. This was led by our iconic cable knit sweaters and cardigans, linen shirts and chinos, double knit sweatshirt, rugby shirts and tailored suit separates. We continue to see evidence that consumers are turning to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. Our roots in quality and timeless style remain a competitive advantage in this context, supporting our strengthening value proposition. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include women's outerwear and our emerging home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits in the quarter.Women's, our largest long-term opportunity, continues to outpace total company performance, supported by our Spring '23 California Dreaming collection inspired by the natural beauty, optimism and glamor of the West Coast, Polos, day dresses and lightweight skirts in seasonal florals and silks, newer wide-like bottoms and encouraging growth in our Polo ID handbags. Other special releases this quarter included the launch of our Polo Mirum sneaker, our first luxury sneaker that is 100% plastic-free. Leveraging our investment in natural fiber welding, Mirum is made with an innovative combination of natural rubber, cotton, cork and plant oil. Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles. Switching to our third key initiatives, winning key cities with our consumer ecosystem. We remain committed to developing our key city ecosystems around the world, with a focus on elevating and connecting all of our consumer touch points across every channel. At the same time, we are clearly pivoting our business toward direct-to-consumer which already represents about 2/3 of our sales.Our investments in high-quality new customer recruitment and increasingly elevated distribution are working. Our full-price retail channels led the growth in the quarter, consistent with recent trends. This is helping to mitigate near-term inflationary headwinds facing a subsegment of more value-sensitive consumers. Our positive retail comps were supported by continued momentum in our core Polo products and luxury collections, along with improving foreign tourist sales and successful clienteling by our dedicated sales teams. This performance more than offset continued pressure in our outlet comps, which were challenged by a more promotional North American market.We opened a select number of iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, notably in Amsterdam, Tainan and Kuala Lumpur, featuring an elevated assortment and prime luxury adjacencies. These stores are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers. We opened a total of 28 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter, with the majority again in Asia, particularly in China.China sales accelerated to more than 50% growth with easier compares following last year's Shanghai lockdowns. We were particularly encouraged by our strong 6/18 performance, which outpaced peers and reinforced our new customer acquisition in the market. And over 40% of our transactions were generated from new consumers. Looking ahead, we still expect China to remain one of our fastest-growing markets.Within our digital businesses, sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly-operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce were flat this quarter. Strong growth in our international markets more than offset declines in North America, where the digital channel has also become more promotional. This quarter's digital performance was clearly below our long-term targets, and we implemented key interventions during the quarter, which will continue into the fall season.Encouragingly, we started to see improvement in our North America digital trends from June onward, as Jane will discuss in a moment.And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our 5 key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As part of our ongoing work to deliver superior operational capabilities, we are implementing process improvements and new tools to streamline our value chain and drive long-term margin opportunities. Our recent work has resulted in a 25% reduction in our overall Spring '24 SKU count, even as we continue to develop our high-potential categories. Within citizenship and sustainability, we were proud to be recognized as a top-rated ESG performer by Sustainalytics as we work to embed sustainability in all we do. And within our people and culture, we were recently named a best company for women to advance by parity.org for the fourth consecutive year. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's solid start to this fiscal year. We continue to focus on offense, agility and pragmatism in these dynamic times. And we believe Ralph Lauren is firmly in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments. Underpinned by Rob's timeless vision and the strength of our iconic brand, we have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with consumer needs and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation. From our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline.With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.Jane Hamilton NielsenThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid start to fiscal '24, with first quarter results ahead of our expectations. This quarter's performance demonstrates the broad-based strength of our strategy and the agility of our teams in a highly dynamic global operating environment. This gives us confidence in delivering on both our long-term commitments as well as the fiscal '24 outlook we outlined in May.We drove positive first quarter revenue growth, exceeding our guidance. We returned to gross margin expansion this quarter with clean inventories, all while overcoming peak raw material costs and our culture of cost discipline enabled us to deliver 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 13.7%, with operating profit dollars up 9%.We continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including roughly $100 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases this quarter. Our first quarter financial performance underscores our position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some of the highlights from the quarter.Total company revenues in the first quarter increased 1% above our outlook. Strong performance in Europe and Asia more than offset a decline in North America, which was negatively impacted by a wholesale timing shift into the prior quarter, as noted on our last call. Our digital ecosystem sales were about flat with growth in international offsetting a decline in North America.Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus last year to 69.3%. This was above our outlook, driven by lower freight expense and 15% AUR growth, along with favorable channel, geographic and product mix. The cost of raw materials, notably cotton, continued to be a headwind in the quarter as expected.Looking ahead, we plan to continue leveraging price to offset cost inflation, which will moderate this fall from peak spring '23 levels. As a reminder, our long-term approach to AUR continues to be a multipronged strategy driven by product mix elevation, more personalized and targeted promotion, select like-for-like increases based on competitive benchmarking, disciplined inventory management to limit excess and favorable geographic and channel mix shifts. We expect these drivers to continue delivering positive, albeit a more modest level of AUR growth longer term. Adjusted operating expenses increased 40 basis points to 55.6% of sales in the first quarter. Marketing was 6% of sales compared to 7% last year. As noted on our last call, we are shifting a higher proportion of marketing and ecosystem investments into the second quarter of this fiscal year, driving expense deleverage in Q2; however, we continue to expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales, consistent with our long-term guidance. Moving to segment performance, starting with North America. First quarter revenues decreased 10%. This included about 5 points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption, as previously noted. The rest of the decline was largely driven by continued inflationary pressures on our more value-oriented consumers.In North America Retail, first quarter comps declined 6%, following a 5% increase last year. We continued to deliver strong growth in our Ralph Lauren stores while performance was softer than expected in outlet and digital. In our channels with exposure to value-oriented consumers, notably outlet, inflation continues to pressure consumer spending and the competitive set has grown increasingly promotional.Our North American digital business was also pressured in April and May. However, we delivered improved trends toward the end of June, as we implemented key actions to improve our sales and conversion in the channel. Looking ahead, we expect to drive modest sequential improvement in our retail business through the rest of fiscal '24. We have proactively adjusted our Fall '23 buys to focus on our core. We are launching new digital enhancements as well as our Canada digital flagship this fall. And we are making key investments in personalized communication and leveraging selective promotions to drive conversion and keep inventories healthy. These actions remain consistent with our initial guidance for fiscal '24.In North America Wholesale, revenues decreased mid-teens to last year. The return to a normalized cadence of spring deliveries had a 12-point negative impact on our growth in the channel this quarter. Our wholesale AUR increased 11% as we continued to elevate our product mix while keeping our wholesale inventories clean. We remain cautious on the channel through the rest of this year on softer reorders and broader challenges in the channel. Moving on to Europe. First quarter revenues increased 7%. While this was ahead of our expectations, the first quarter included a roughly 5-point benefit from earlier timing of Fall '23 wholesale deliveries. Retail comps were up 2% on top of a strong 34% compare last year, which benefited from a sales resurgence post-Omicron. Brick-and-mortar comps rose 1%, led by Ralph Lauren stores. Europe AUR increased mid-teens in the quarter. Our Europe's digital ecosystem grew mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by an 8% comp in our own digital commerce and the wholesale timing shift, which also benefited our digital accounts. Europe wholesale increased 11%, driven by the earlier fall shipments. While this timing shift will negatively impact our wholesale sell-ins by an estimated 4 points in both Q2 and Q3, respectively, it should also position us well to capture full price sales in season.Aside from the wholesale timing shifts, we are maintaining our full year fiscal '24 Europe outlook of low single-digit growth reflecting our continued caution on the macro environment and digital wholesale channel. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 18% with growth across each of our key markets led again by China. China accelerated to more than 50% growth as we lap significant COVID-related restrictions in the prior year period. Our brands demonstrated strong momentum during the Golden Week and 618 Festival. First quarter sales in Japan increased high single digits despite a slow recovery in inbound tourism and our continued near-term caution on the market. Within our other nonreportable segments licensing revenue declined high single digits, in line with our plan. The decline reflects the previously disclosed transition out of our Lauren men's suiting license as part of our broader brand elevation strategy. The exit will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the fiscal year until we lap it in fiscal '25.Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our Fortress Foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We are tightly controlling our inventory levels and driving efficiencies with net inventory up 1% this quarter, in line with our top line growth. Increases in Asia and Europe were largely offset by a high single-digit decline in North American inventories. We expect second quarter inventory growth to continue moderating, which should position our brands well ahead of the important holiday season.Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds and foreign currency volatility among others.For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits. Foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact reported revenues by about 20 basis points due to unfavorable shifts in Asian exchange rates versus our prior outlook. We continue to expect top line growth to be led by Asia, up double digits, following by low single-digit growth in Europe. We still expect a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends in the first half and wholesale timing shifts in Q1.We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin to expand about 100 basis points with reduced freight costs, favorable geographic and channel mix and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting cotton inflation. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset higher operating expenses as we invest in the key strategic initiatives outlined at Investor Day, particularly around digital and key city ecosystem expansion as well as marketing and sustainability. Relative to our Investor Day base period, guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to slightly up in constant currency, led by growth in Asia. We remain cautious on North America, but expect sequential improvement following Q1's negative timing shifts. Conversely, we expect second quarter Europe and digital ecosystem sales to be sequentially weaker, both due to the earlier Fall shipments reported in Q1. Excluding the shift, we expect underlying trends in Europe to be more in line with our full year outlook for the region of low single-digit growth.We expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 9% to 9.5% in constant currency and 9.5% to 10% on a reported basis. We expect constant currency gross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points to be more than offset by higher operating expenses due to the timing of strategic investments as previously indicated. This includes key digital ecosystem and marketing investments, notably the shift of our fashion show into the second quarter from the third quarter of last year.From a cadence perspective, our outlook implies stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year, driven by our merchandising actions, marketing activations for Fall holiday and the investments just noted. In addition, we will start to lap negative inflationary impacts from the second half of last year. We continue to expect operating margins to expand in Q3 and Q4 and for the full year on both a reported and constant currency basis.We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the full year and roughly 21% to 22% for the second quarter. And capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million.In closing, inspired by Ralph's enduring vision. Our teams around the world continue to demonstrate agility and dedication every day as we execute on our next great chapter, Accelerate plan. While we remain acutely attuned to the near-term challenges facing certain areas of our business, we believe in our strategic priorities, investing in lifelong consumer relationships, leveraging our powerful core products in high potential categories and developing our key city ecosystems. These priorities, combined with our passionate teams, put us in a position of strength to continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation.With that, let's open up the call for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Patrice, to take a step back, your first quarter total company results outperformed expectations on a consolidated basis. but your first quarter and your outlook are still below the long-term guidance for North America. So do you believe you can still achieve your long-term Investor Day top line algorithm? And then Jane, any change? Or just what is your confidence in mid-teens operating margins next year for the company?Patrice Jean Louis LouvetMatt, thank you for your question. Yes, first of all, overall, our teams did a very good job delivering on our top and bottom line commitments for this quarter, even with ongoing challenging backdrops across the different regions. As you know, our strategy has multiple growth engines, meaning resilience is embedded in our strategy and in our plan. If you look at it across regions and then we'll zoom into North America.Our second largest business, Europe, continues to hold up well despite macro headwinds. We're also feeling very good about the way our performance came in on China and broader Asia you saw China up 50% this quarter. And while North America is facing some pressure in the near term, our core consumer, which is a more elevated consumer continues to be resilient, and we have the right strategies in place to drive growth well beyond these headwinds. In fact, a couple of data points to illustrate that.First of all, our value and also our luxury brand perception scores are growing faster in North America than any other region in the world. And if I provide additional perspective, if you look at it from a channel perspective, our emphasis and investments are in DTC and which is now about 2/3 of our North America business and where we have the biggest growth opportunity. From a product perspective, we have multiple opportunities across high potential categories from outerwear, to home and to women more broadly.On Brand, we continue to invest in new customer acquisition. You saw that this quarter again, $1.2 million overall, a good chunk of that coming from North America, as well as key brand moments like our upcoming U.S. open partnership and our upcoming fashion show early September.And then finally, our key enablers here are also quite important, right? Our inventory levels are healthy. We go into back-to-school. We're going to go into holiday in a really good place. And our operating discipline and balance sheet give us the flexibility to continue investing in our growth, to continue investing in our evolution. So we're also well positioned as conditions improve in North America and beyond. So I would say even with the near-term pressures, Matt, we're confident that we're in a strong position to perform and deliver over the long term, and that's really where all our focus is.Jane Hamilton NielsenYes. And just to follow up on the second part of your question, I would say, yes, we're on track. We are still working towards our Investor Day targets. Although our performance is likely to remain a little choppy given the volatile macroeconomic conditions, but we're really encouraged by our first 5 quarters of top line and margin progress in constant currency.Importantly, I think we feel that we have the right strategy and that our multiple engines of growth, give us the flexibility to lean in where we need to and where we're strong when some parts of our business are challenged. So I think that those things are what's giving us confidence. And as we look forward, we still see opportunity to reach our long-term financial algorithm.OperatorThe next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleMy question, Jane, is for you. The company continues to report strong AUR growth after 6 years of consecutive gains, how much further can the AUR journey continue? And how much runway do you realistically have? And then maybe if I can add a second one for Patrice.You touched on high potential categories in the prepared remarks. Can you just kind of take us into a little bit deeper dive on that and just tell us what's changed over the 90 days, the last 90 days, give you more confidence that those categories can be meaningful revenue growth drivers for the company over the next year plus?Jane Hamilton NielsenSure. Thanks for the question, Jay. Stepping back a bit, we are really confident in our long-term brand elevation journey. As we said at Investor Day, we have 3 key drivers of long-term revenue growth, new customer recruiting, select unit growth and AUR growth. So with regard to your question and AUR specifically, we're confident in our AUR strategy and expect our multipronged approach to drive continued, albeit a more moderate level of AUR growth as we look ahead.You've seen us elevate across products, the consumer experience, stores and our brand positioning. And AUR is an output of this journey. Importantly, as we've elevated our consumer value perception metrics have continued to increase, even again this quarter. These factors taken together are really what gives us confidence in our long-term AUR trajectory.That said, we're keenly aware of the current environment, and we continue to keep a really sharp focus on the value we are driving and delivering. With some of these pressures, we're seeing some of our more value-oriented consumers need to have more -- needless to lean in a bit more during select key consumer value-seeking moments like back-to-school and holiday and our guidance contemplates this as we move forward.As cost inflation starts to moderate ahead, we'll adjust our like-for-like pricing elements of our AUR strategy accordingly. And we're not expecting double-digit AUR growth every quarter from here. But overall, the elevation strategy hasn't changed, and we plan to continue AUR growth this year and beyond.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetAnd then, Jay, on your question regarding high potential categories. We've been really pleased with the continued strength on those businesses. If you kind of zero in on the 3 that we called out, so outerwear, women's more broadly with handbags being an element for that. and then also home. Those categories delivered ahead of company trend, both in Q1 and as it did last fiscal year, actually low single -- low double digits across the board.So all 3 are in a good position. The standout is clearly women's, where we have fantastic momentum across all brands within our portfolio, with probably Polo being even further highlight. And I think as we look at the capabilities needed to win across all 3 of these, we feel very nicely positioned not just for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but actually for the years to come in terms of tapping into the significant growth opportunities.OperatorThe next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.Laurent Andre VasilescuThank you very much for taking my question. jane, I would love to ask about the 2Q guide. I think that's where the focus is, unfortunately, near term. But just can you give us a bridge on the -- from the first quarter marketing spend, I missed that number. But if you can give us a little bit more color why the operating margin will be 9.5% to 10% constant currency? And then I saw the increased gross margin for the full year on a CC basis. I would have expected that you still had foresight on commodity and freight cost 90 days ago. So is the increase due to geo-mix or less promotions in the marketplace because of their inventory levels?Jane Hamilton NielsenAll right. Laurent, let me -- could you just repeat your question on marketing, you broke up a bit.Laurent Andre VasilescuSo sorry about that. I'm overseas. I was asking if -- what the marketing spend was for 1Q as well as how do you think about the 2Q marketing spend because there's a shift with the fashion show.Jane Hamilton NielsenSure. So Laurent, as we look at the second quarter, what we're seeing is we continue to be cautious about the overall consumer environment. You'll see, as we called out in the first quarter that the wholesale timing shift in Europe will impact us in the second quarter. You will start to see sequentially from here some improvement in what you saw in North America wholesale.And in fact, as we look at North America more broadly, I think you'll see a sequential improvement while we're still a cautious, sequential improvement on the top line as we move through. And just to keep in mind in our second quarter guidance, APAC is overlapping its strongest growth of the year last year as we came out of some of the COVID-related shutdowns.On the marketing side, what you'll see in terms of our spend, this first quarter, we were about 5.7% of sales. You'll see us go to 8% of sales in marketing in the second quarter. On a dollar growth basis, that will be our peak marketing dollar growth that is as our tradition, our highest dollar spend in marketing will be in Q3, aligned with the holiday quarter.And then as we look at your question on our second quarter OI margin, what you're really seeing is, in that second quarter, you'll see the impact to OI margin of the shipments in Europe into the first quarter coming out of the second quarter. Also, as we've seen some softness in North America wholesale, we've been able to lean into our DTC channel, specifically in North America, which has a gross margin benefit, which we're calling out in our full year guidance. But carriers carries heavier SG&amp;A expense but is OI margin neutral. And that's playing through what you're seeing in terms of expense to leverage.And that said, on SG&amp;A expenses overall, as Patrice mentioned, we are playing often. So we are not pulling back on our investments in our digital platforms in Q2, we are investing to make sure that we can go live on a new website in Canada and that we will implement later in the second half, a new search engine, as well as our continued advancement of store opening. So we're not backing off building growth into the future. I do understand the investments are in Q2, but these are both long-term benefits and some benefits that will play out in the second half of the year.And then just in terms of gross margin, we're confident in our gross margin guidance. Mix shift plays a small role, but we are realizing the benefits of freight, which we called out in May, will give us about 100 basis points of benefit as we move through fiscal '24. That's about offset by cotton. But as we look forward to FY '25, we expect cotton to turn into a tailwind at the very end of the quarter. We're also seeing with our AUR up 15%, we're really confident in our ability to continue to elevate with AUR as an outcome of that. And we're confident in that as we move forward, although I said it will moderate as like the need for like-for-like pricing due to inflation also moderates.OperatorThe next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you talk about the pressures of the value consumer and the AUR increases, what are you seeing globally that value consumer, whether in North America, Europe or in Asia versus the more higher-end consumer and helping to drive the AUR growth? Is there a difference?Patrice Jean Louis LouvetDana, so we actually are really pleased to see how our core consumer, which is a more elevated consumer is responding to our product offering, right, particularly as we pivot more towards sophisticated casual, which is really where the interest is at this point and which really plays to our core strengths of things, chinos, suit separates, cable-knit sweaters, Oxford shirts and those kind of things. And consumers responding well to that elevation and the core consumer represents the bulk of our business.And this is true both in Asia and even in China, where we have our highest AUR, we're continuing to drive AUR. But this trend in Europe, it's also true across North America. So core consumer is resilient around the world, responding well to our overall product offering and AUR expansion. As a reminder, our AUR is a combination, as Jane mentioned earlier, 4 different factors, right? Product mix, channel and region mix, were targeted pricing -- like-for-like pricing and pull back on promotional activity.As far as the value-oriented consumer is concerned, we really see that dynamic primarily in North America. And that group is becoming a smaller and smaller part of our overall customer makeup because, as you know, as we recruit new consumers are recruiting new higher-value customers.I think what we're seeing with that customer, which frankly isn't surprising given the inflationary context is pressure on what they invest in, in terms of the choices that they make. Where we're seeing the greatest price sensitivity that is on our basic categories, which I might point the COVID categories, right? So we're seeing pressure on [T's,] on fleece, on shorts.But overall, we're continuing the AUR expansion journey. We are seeing our value perception continue to increase. So we're not just taking land pricing like maybe other players might. We are actually being very deliberate on elevating product, elevating our storytelling, elevating our shopping experience, which drives value -- enhanced value perception, which then enables us to drive AUR, which gives us to change earlier for confidence that we can continue to do that as we continue to enhance the makeup of our customer base, higher value customers, resilient customers around the world.Dana Lauren TelseyAnd then just kind of get your perspective on the wholesale channel and how -- when you see it return to stabilization even growth go forward given the timing shifts that have occurred.Jane Hamilton NielsenAs we look at wholesale, Dana, I think it's really a story of different regional factors. So overall, what we're expecting is that in North America, as I mentioned, Q1 will be the low point in terms of wholesale growth, and we expect to build roughly sequentially as we move through the year while exiting in flat to positive range for North America wholesale.And then with Europe, we've obviously called out that the plus 10% that we saw in Europe this quarter had some opportunities that we took for full price selling to ship in a little earlier. That will have about a 4-point impact to Europe in Qs 2 and 3, but we would expect Europe overall for the year to have some flat to down low single digit in our wholesale business.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.Christopher Michael NardoneSo in terms of your North America Retail business, how should we think about the level of promotional activity that you're embedding in your outlook for this upcoming holiday season compared to last year? And then how should we think about top line in North America retail? Should we also see potential improvement starting in 2Q?Jane Hamilton NielsenThanks for your question, Chris. I think what we're calling out both in our guidance and in our intent is that as Patrice mentioned, we are seeing value oriented consumers really responding during key, sort of what I would say, consumer moments. And so what we've left in our algorithm is contemplated in our guidance is some select targeted promotional activity, specifically for that value consumer.So you'll see us go sharp back to school. You'll see us be sharp in key holiday moments. Black Friday, specifically. A few days leading up to Christmas, especially Cyber Monday. But what we're calling out is that we'll continue AUR growth, albeit at a more moderate rate and AUR growth that leads to gross margin expansion. So this is not at all moving away from our brand elevation strategy. It's about being agile, responding to key consumer moments in a targeted basis. And you've seen us go to the top end of our gross margin range. So we've got a good handle on where we need to be.And I would say that if you look at our inventories up 1% this quarter, you don't have pressure to be promotional. We want to go where the consumer is going, respond to the consumer need for value at select times, but not at all be pressured in terms of moving backwards. We're about brand elevation and AUR growth, while being smart and pragmatic in this current environment.So from North America, top line standpoint, as we've called out and we've looked at revenue, we expect North America as we put in place some key interventions like outlet interventions that we just talked about, like the digital ecosystem investments with (inaudible) going live in Q3. Like key brand moments like the fashion show, we expect North America revenues to increase, especially in the second half where we would expect them to be in positive territory.OperatorThe next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulJane, I was wondering if you could spend a little more time on new customer acquisition sort of success that you're seeing both domestically and internationally and sort of how you expect that to unfold over the next few quarters?Jane Hamilton NielsenYes, Bob, and then I'll turn it over to Patrice. We were really happy with the 1.2 million new consumers that we saw engaged with the brand in Q1. As you look backwards, you've seen us be pretty consistent on that trajectory. I think it's really an outcome of, one, the investments we've put in the brand; and two, the investments we've made in our consumer intelligence group and our use of AI and elasticity models to really drive more personalized communication with these new consumers and is really an important part of our AUR and revenue growth journey.We're now -- if you think back when we used to promote to drive new consumers, our next great chapter strategy has really been about enticing higher-value consumers into the brand with content and products that they respond to and being available in channels where they want to shop.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetYes, Bob, I would add probably 3 things. First of all, we're seeing this growth of new consumers consistently over time, right, because every quarter, we are talking about 1 million to 1.5 million new consumers. So we've got an engine that's delivering consistently. And it's delivering consistently around the world. This is not just dependent on more emerging market growth. So we're excited about that, both in our core markets like North America, Europe and also Asia.The second point is this is really the outcome of how we've expanded our marketing activity portfolio, which now ranges from powerful experiential fashion moments like the one we're about to do early September, what we just did in Milan with men's. Two, high-impact celebrity dressing, you saw some of the highlights for the past quarter and we're doing this consistently. Through partnerships with key sports platforms, they're really resonating particularly with that younger consumer. Two, now presence in gaming and metaverse related activity that's also helping us engage in a different environment. Two, fantastic work by our teams in the markets on social media platforms, right?You heard the numbers earlier today, $53 million and a half -- $53.5 million. New followers on social media across all the different platforms around the world. So this engine that's been put in place that has a diversity of activities that's targeted to different generations, different genders that's enhancing brand equity is the engine that will consistently drive new customer acquisition. We talk a lot about AUR when it comes to Ralph Lauren, but it's important to remember that our growth algorithm is dependent on 3 elements. New consumer recruiting, select unit growth and AUR. And we feel really good about all 3.OperatorSitting now for Paul Lejuez, we have Tracy Kogan with Citigroup.Unidentified AnalystTwo questions. I was hoping you could just detail some of the drivers in the women's business. And what's the growth in the Lauren brand versus the Polo product? And then secondly, I was hoping you could talk about -- I think you said your U.S. wholesale AUR was up 11%. And I was wondering what you expect for wholesale AUR for the year end and whether you're getting any pushback from your wholesale partners on price increases you may have taken in the U.S.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetSure. So the key success drivers behind our overall women's portfolio are really the 3 key factors. First of all, we have a product offering that's really resonating with our target consumer. And if you think about what's happening around the world right now and this -- there's a lot of conversations around quiet luxury. What Ralph Lauren has stood for from the time this company was founded, 56 years ago, has been quality, has been timeless style, has been confidence in what you're buying, and that's what consumers are looking for today, and particularly what women are looking for today.So the way this is translating from a product category standpoint, is growth in linen, growth in suit separates, growth in our dresses business. We're starting to see some early exciting momentum on our handbag business, and this is playing out across both collection, Polo and Lauren. The other element that's actually really supporting, particularly our Polo and our Lauren business is the elevation work that we're doing.It's really moving up in terms of product proposition, is moving up in terms of storytelling, is moving up in terms of how we present the product, both online and in-store. I think the consumer is responding really nicely to that. As I mentioned earlier, within our high potential categories are actually our highest performing category is actually our women's business. So we have a proposition that's resonating with consumers around the world. This elevation journey is clearly connecting the product line that we offer is relevant for what consumers are looking for today, and we're very excited about what the future holds for this business.Jane Hamilton NielsenYes. I would just add, Tracy, that Polo Women's significantly outpaced both our total growth and led our women's growth with up high single digit with Lauren pacing about at company level of growth, a little bit ahead. So we're very encouraged by that. The second part of your question, which is wholesale AUR up 11% this quarter. We still see a strong trajectory for AUR at wholesale.But like in our DTC business, we expect that AUR growth to moderate as the like-for-like pricing moderates as inflation pressures abate. We called out the fall with our peak pressure in terms of cotton costs, we'll start to see those moderate into Spring, and you'll see some moderation in our wholesale AUR.I would say the support from our retail partners has been tremendous. This has been a multiyear journey that we've partnered together on. They see the power of elevating the brand. They see the power of the brand, and we're both benefiting from improved consumer desirability that's pulling through into migration of the consumer into higher-end products. So product mix has been a factor in that. And also -- and so continued AUR elevation but similar to DTC's moderation.OperatorOur final question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen.John David KernanExcellent. Jane, how should we think about inventory dollars? It looks like they're sitting around $1.2 billion as of the first quarter. Still you've got some easier compares, I guess, as we go through the rest of the year. Where do you think inventory dollars should land as we head toward the back half of the year? And when do you think we'll start to see some meaningful declines off of what was fairly elevated levels last year?Jane Hamilton NielsenYes, John, I think that as we called out last year, you'd start to see our inventory levels moderate and aligned with sales. We've achieved that. Now throughout the year, I think what you -- what we plan is that you will see inventory declines as we exit the year as we start to focus on getting weeks on hand in line with pre-COVID levels.And we feel very good, not just about our outlook for declining inventory dollars, but also about the health of our inventories, how we're positioned in core, that really gives us the flexibility to be agile with demand variability. So we feel good about how we're positioned. We think we're in excellent shape relative to some of our industry peers and expect higher inventory trends as we exit the year.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetOkay. Well, listen, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in November. And until then, take care. Have a great day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Results have gained from robust demand and brand strength. The company has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.RL has reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 for the fiscal first quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15. Also, the bottom line rose 24.5% year over year from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter.Net revenues grew 0.4% year over year to $1,496.5 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,482 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 1% from the prior-year quarter. The top line witnessed impacts of 80 basis points (bps) from adverse currency rates. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 15.8% in the past three months against the industry’s 1.4% decline.However, shares of RL declined more than 4% before the trading session on Aug 10. This is expected to have resulted from high interest rates, leading to muted U.S. luxury spending.Segmental DetailsNorth America: In the fiscal first quarter, the segment’s revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $632 million and came below our estimate of $635 million. Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel fell 6% year over year, wherein the same for brick-and-mortar stores moved down 8%, while digital commerce decreased 5%.

This was mainly driven by solid AUR growth across all regions, favorable channel and geographic mix, and reduced freight, which more than offset continued pressure from raw material costs and adverse currency.Adjusted operating expenses inched up 1% from the year-ago period to $830 million in the fiscal first quarter, driven by higher compensation, and rent &amp; occupancy costs, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 30 bps to 56% in the reported quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income was $200 million, up 5.3% year over year.

This includes 20 bps of negative impacts of currency. The gross  margin is forecast to expand 100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR, favorable geographic mix and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation. The metric includes 30 bps of adverse impacts of foreign currency. The fiscal 2024 tax rate is likely to be 23-24%.For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. This includes approximately 100 basis points of positive foreign currency impact.The operating margin is predicted to be 9.5-10% on a reported basis and 9-9.5% in constant currency. The gross margin is expected to expand 40-60 bps, which will more than offset higher operating expenses. The metric is likely to witness 10 bps of adverse currency impacts.

Elsewhere, News Corp sounds off on its generative artificial intelligence plans, while the Supreme Court places a temporary block on OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's $6 billion bankruptcy settlement.1. Futures mixed ahead of producer price dataU.S. stock futures were mixed Friday, as traders digested cooler-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data and looked ahead to the release of a monthly measure of producer price growth later in the session.By 05:21 ET (09:21 GMT), the Dow futures contract added 32 points or 0.09%, S&amp;P 500 futures were mostly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 19 points or 0.12%.Underpinning sentiment heading into the last day of trading this week was Thursday's U.S. consumer price index, which showed that annual headline inflation in the world's largest economy rose by less than expected in July. On a monthly basis, the reading increased by 0.2% for a second straight month, bolstering projections that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from its long-running campaign of interest rate hikes.More detail will likely be added to the inflation picture today with the publication of the producer price index for last month. Economists estimate that the figure, which gauges the selling prices received by domestic producers, accelerated to 0.7% annually and 0.2% monthly in July. The core number, which removes food and energy, is seen picking up the pace slightly to 0.2% month-on-month, but slowing marginally to 2.3% year-on-year.2. News Corp eyes AIMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) saw revenue fall by almost a tenth in the latest quarter, dragging the owner of the Wall Street Journal and the Sunday Times down to a three-month loss.The decline was mitigated, however, by the company's Dow Jones division. The publisher of Market Watch and Barron's posted segment earnings of $133 million, a jump of 25% and the unit's best profit since joining News Corp.Story continuesMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson outlined the group's wider plans to adjust to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence. Calling it a ""challenge"" to the maintenance of publishers' intellectual property, Thomson said News Corp is in active negotiations to set a value for its content and IP.But Thomson maintained that generative AI still represents a ""remarkable opportunity"" to build fresh revenue sources and slash costs.News Corp shares were little changed in premarket U.S. trading Friday.3. Supreme Court halts Purdue Pharma opioid settlementThe U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the bankruptcy proceedings of Purdue Pharma, casting doubt over whether members of the Sackler family that owns the company can be shielded from any future claims related to the U.S. opioid epidemic.Earlier this year, a lower court approved a deal that would have shielded the Sacklers from potential lawsuits in return for a one-off payment of $6B to victims of the crisis.The Justice Department subsequently asked that the settlement be delayed, claiming that it improperly removes any future liability from third parties for contributing to the crisis. The Supreme Court has now agreed to hear oral arguments in December.Purdue, the maker of opioid painkiller OxyContin, would need the agreement to exit bankruptcy. The company has rebuffed the DoJ's request, arguing that it would take ""billions of dollars"" out of opioid recovery programs and eventually make ""meaningful recovery"" for victims more difficult.4. UBS ends Credit Suisse deal's state backstopUBS (SIX:UBSG) announced on Friday that it no longer needed government backing worth CHF 9B, or just over $10B, that was put in place to protect the Swiss banking giant from losses linked to its takeover of rival Credit Suisse.The rescue had included an agreement from the state to shield UBS from CHF 9B in losses from the arrangement, as long as it guaranteed to take a hit of CHF 5B.UBS also halted a CHF 100B liquidity backstop that was offered by the Swiss National Bank. The aid was first established during a crisis in March that rocked the country's banking sector and eventually led to the state-sponsored tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse.Following a ""comprehensive assessment"" of Credit Suisse's non-core assets, UBS said it had concluded that it was not necessary to maintain these liquidity support measures. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, fully repaid a CHF 50B emergency loan from the Swiss government first, UBS added.Swiss-listed shares in UBS climbed Friday.5. Crude hovers around flatlineOil prices were choppy Friday, but stayed mostly around the flatline, with traders trying to judge U.S. inflation data, concerns about a stuttering economic recovery in top crude importer China, and optimistic demand forecasts from OPEC.Thursday’s U.S. CPI release saw the dollar strengthening, hurting the crude market as it makes the commodity more expensive for buyers holding foreign currencies.Growing fears over China’s economy also weighed on oil markets, but this was counterbalanced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirming on Thursday that it still expects world oil demand to rise by 2.25 million barrels per day in 2024, compared with the growth of 2.44 million barrels per day this year.By 05:22 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $82.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract dipped 0.5% to $86.01.Related ArticlesPPI ahead, News Corp's AI plans - what's moving marketsChina to replace $140 billion LGFV debt with local bonds - Bloomberg NewsTake Five: Are we there yet?]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.67 billion.

Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for News Corp. Unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

The company reported higher revenues year over year, backed by healthy demand trends in all verticals.

However, the decline in fixed broadband subscribers partially reversed this trend.Net IncomeThe company reported a net loss of $77 million or a loss of 83 cents per share compared with a net loss of $21.6 million or a loss of 29 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. High interest expenses and non-recurring acquisition-related costs impacted the bottom line during the quarter.

The 28% year-over-year growth was driven by healthy demand for commercial air IFC services. The Inmarsat buyout strengthened the company’s mobility and enterprise service businesses during the quarter. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA recorded a sharp increase of 51% year over year, backed by higher commercial air IFC service activations, the contribution from Inmarsat and greater U.S. fixed broadband ARPU.Commercial network contributed $149 million to revenues, up 32% year over year.

Higher information assurance product deliveries supported the top line. The company signed a three-and-a-half-year extension with the DoD (Department of Defense) on an existing contract. During the quarter, it also secured a deal from Australia and New Zealand for Southern Positioning Augmentation Network satellite service. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $58 million, up from $24 million, backed by the contribution from Inmarsat and solid product revenues.Story continuesOther DetailsIn the June quarter, the company reported an operating loss of $41.5 million compared with an operating loss of $27.1 million in the prior-year quarter.

Derrickson; President, CEO &amp; Director; BSQUARE CorporationPresentationOperatorGood day, and welcome to the Bsquare Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ralph Derrickson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Ralph C. DerricksonThank you. Good afternoon, investors, and welcome. Joining me today is Cheryl Wynne, Bsquare's Chief Financial Officer. Before we go any further, we'd like to remind you that the call is being webcast, and that a recording of the call and the text of our prepared remarks will be available on the Bsquare website.During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.In our commentary, we may also refer to GAAP and to non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the cautionary text regarding forward-looking statements contained in Bsquare's earnings release issued today on our website at www.bsquare.com under Investors. All per share amounts discussed today are fully diluted numbers where applicable.We will be taking questions after our prepared remarks. For anyone who would like to arrange a follow-up conversation with us, please send an e-mail to investorrelations@bsquare.com. This mailbox is monitored regularly, and you will get a response within 1 business day.Let's start by having Cheryl take us through the Q2 results in detail, and I'll continue with my remarks after that. Cheryl, why don't you get us started?Cheryl WynneThank you, Ralph, and good afternoon, investors. Today, I'll be providing an overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Let's take a look now at the components of our results. I'll start with a review of our income statement and then move to a discussion of our liquidity. Most of my comparisons will be to the first quarter of 2023. I'll let you know when I'm comparing to other periods.Total revenue for the second quarter was approximately $6.5 million, which was a decrease of $1.6 million or 20% from the first quarter. The Partner Solutions segment was the primary driver of the decrease with a $1.5 million decline. Edge to Cloud revenue decreased $100,000. Despite the revenue decline, total gross profit increased by $90,000.Let's take a look at our revenue and gross profit results at a segment level, starting first with Partner Solutions. Partner Solutions revenue decreased $1.5 million or 21% quarter-over-quarter. The decline is the continuation of a general trend that we've seen in this segment for quite some time now. Partner Solutions gross profit increased $164,000, and gross margin rate improved 6.8 percentage points. The gross profit decrease driven by the revenue decline was offset by margin rate improvement primarily related to rebate credits earned through Microsoft distributor incentives program. These credits are recorded as a reduction of Partner Solutions' cost of revenue and have always had a favorable impact on Partner Solutions' gross profit. However, the impact this quarter was greater as there were changes to the program. As a result of the changes, we recorded onetime adjustments of approximately $300,000 that favorably impacted Partner Solutions' gross profit.In the Edge to Cloud segment, revenue was $774,000, which was a decrease of $100,000 compared to the first quarter. The decline was driven by reduced professional services provided to one of our customers who is transitioning to a new technology platform. The revenue decrease was the primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter gross profit decline of $77,000.Turning our attention now to expenses. Total operating expenses were $2 million, which was a $300,000 increase compared to the first quarter. The increase is entirely driven by selling, general and administrative, or SG&amp;A, costs as our research and development costs were flat quarter-over-quarter. Of the $300,000 increase in SG&amp;A, about 2/3 was due to a decrease in the recognition of cooperative rebate funds from Microsoft. We record these co-op funds as a reduction of marketing expense in the period the expenditure is approved. Timing related to the process of submitting claims and receiving expenditure approval can cause fluctuations in the amount of co-op funds recognized each quarter.Please note that going forward, due to the changes in Microsoft's distributor incentive program, the full amount of rebate from Microsoft will be recognized as a reduction of Partner Solutions' cost of revenue. None of it will be recognized as a reduction of marketing expense because there will no longer be requirements related to how the funds are spent.The remaining $100,000 increase in SG&amp;A was due primarily to an increase in professional fees related to our annual shareholder meeting and strategic transaction activity. As you may recall, during the third quarter of 2022, we implemented an investment strategy intended to take advantage of favorable interest rates while maintaining a focus on liquidity. Our Q2 results include $390,000 of interest income. We intend to continue investing our cash reserves for the foreseeable future until there is an alternative use of the reserves that will produce a higher return for our shareholders.Our loss from operations for the quarter was $650,000, which was a deterioration of $300,000 compared to the first quarter driven by the SG&amp;A cost changes discussed earlier. Net loss for the quarter was $300,000 or $0.01 per diluted share compared to the first quarter net loss of $100,000, less than $0.01 per diluted share. On a year-to-date basis, loss from operations was $1.1 million, an improvement of $500,000 compared to the same period in 2022. Year-to-date net loss was $300,000, an improvement of $1.2 million compared to the first half net loss of $1.5 million in 2022.Turning now to our liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $33.4 million on June 30, 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to December 31, 2022. $660,000 of the decrease was driven by share repurchases, and $1.5 million was due to changes in our working capital accounts.As a reminder, we announced a plan to repurchase up to $5 million worth of our common stock. During the first 6 months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 550,000 shares for just over $650,000. Since program inception, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares for just over $860,000. The repurchase program expired on June 30, 2023, and was not renewed, which Ralph will speak to in a moment.This concludes my summary of our second quarter results, and I'll turn it back to Ralph now.Story continuesRalph C. DerricksonThank you, Cheryl. The decrease in Partner Solutions' revenue is disappointing, but consistent with the year-over-year decline in Microsoft OS licensing revenue that we have discussed on previous calls. Embedded product developers are increasingly turning to Linux and Android for their operating system in an effort to lower their product costs, especially for the smaller footprint devices. That said, we are winning new customers for Windows IoT with superior service and technical support, aggressive pricing and giving them a path to device management and IoT operations. Unfortunately, revenue from new customers is not keeping pace with erosion from customers whose products are going end of life or are switching to alternatives for their OS software. We continue to work closely with Microsoft to share our experience and help them to strengthen the story for Windows IoT in the embedded market. But our expectation is that keeping licensing revenue erosion under 15% would be an achievement.Let's turn our attention now to our bottom line and our efforts to run the business as efficiently as possible. As I've shared on the last 3 calls, achieving breakeven operations is a priority. Our progress towards that goal is most evident in the difference in year-to-date results. 2023 year-to-date operating results are $500,000 better than 2022, a 31% improvement. Further, our net loss improved by $1.2 million, a 78% improvement as our bottom line results were bolstered by interest income. The operating improvements came, in part, as a result of the staffing reductions we made in December of last year and efforts across the board to reduce expense. These improvements are playing out in our operational cash consumption as well.Stepping back from operations, I'd like to turn our attention to what is happening on the strategic front. During the Q1 2023 earnings call, I said that we were not going to continue the status quo, and that action would be taken in a time line measured in months and quarters. As we shared in the earnings press release today, we have been working with Telegraph Hill Advisors, a San Francisco-based investment bank, to run a process to explore the full range of strategic options for generating shareholder value. There isn't more information to share now, but rest assured, we are moving thoughtfully and as aggressively as the process allows. While the process is running, we opted not to renew the share repurchase program. We don't believe the current share price captures the full potential value of the company.Getting back to operations, we will continue to run the business as efficiently as possible and look for opportunities to demonstrate the potential for SquareOne to become the basis of a high-margin SaaS business. We haven't talked about SquareOne since we announced late last year that we were dialing back marketing. But that doesn't mean we've stopped all efforts. In fact, we are in active evaluation with a number of companies who are considering SquareOne as the basis for their device management needs and other customers considering SquareOne as the basis for their IoT system. We have made significant architectural improvements to SquareOne that will allow developers to extend the core functionality via plug-ins and web socket. Notably, this allows us to use AI and ML at the edge and in the cloud to build sophisticated systems that allow individual devices to contribute data and participate in shared decision-making. All of these capabilities can be seen on the SquareOne evaluation site on our website that gives customers up to 30 days of access to SquareOne at no charge.Concluding then, we will continue to serve our customers with superior products and services. At the same time, we will strive to maximize the operational assets of the business while aggressively pursuing strategic options. The Board, Cheryl and I are balancing those priorities with the objective of developing options and opportunities to return value to our shareholders.With that, operator, please open the line for questions. While people are signaling to ask questions, remember if you'd like to arrange a follow-up conversation, please send an e-mail to investorrelations@bsquare.com.Operator(Operator Instructions) Thank you. There are no questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference back over to Ralph Derrickson for any closing remarks.Ralph C. DerricksonThank you, operator, and thank you, investors. I really appreciate your time and attention this afternoon, and I would like to close our call by wishing our CFO a very happy birthday. Thank you.OperatorThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

Security firms and companies have raised concerns, however, that it could result in intellectual property and strategy leaks.Anecdotal examples of people using ChatGPT to help with their day-to-day work include drafting emails, summarising documents and doing preliminary research.Some 28% of respondents to the online poll on artificial intelligence (AI) between July 11 and 17 said they regularly use ChatGPT at work, while only 22% said their employers explicitly allowed such external tools.The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,625 adults across the United States had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points.Some 10% of those polled said their bosses explicitly banned external AI tools, while about 25% did not know if their company permitted use of the technology.ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app in history after its launch in November. It has created both excitement and alarm, bringing its developer OpenAI into conflict with regulators, particularly in Europe, where the company's mass data-collecting has drawn criticism from privacy watchdogs.Human reviewers from other companies may read any of the generated chats, and researchers found that similar artificial intelligence AI could reproduce data it absorbed during training, creating a potential risk for proprietary information.""People do not understand how the data is used when they use generative AI services,"" said Ben King, VP of customer trust at corporate security firm Okta.""For businesses this is critical, because users don't have a contract with many AIs - because they are a free service - so corporates won't have run the risk through their usual assessment process,"" King said.Story continuesOpenAI declined to comment when asked about the implications of individual employees using ChatGPT, but highlighted a recent company blog post assuring corporate partners that their data would not be used to train the chatbot further, unless they gave explicit permission.When people use Google's Bard it collects data such as text, location, and other usage information. The company allows users to delete past activity from their accounts and request that content fed into the AI be removed. Alphabet-owned Google declined to comment when asked for further detail.Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.'HARMLESS TASKS'A U.S.-based employee of Tinder said workers at the dating app used ChatGPT for ""harmless tasks"" like writing emails even though the company does not officially allow it.""It's regular emails. Very non-consequential, like making funny calendar invites for team events, farewell emails when someone is leaving ... We also use it for general research,"" said the employee, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak with reporters.The employee said Tinder has a ""no ChatGPT rule"" but that employees still use it in a ""generic way that doesn't reveal anything about us being at Tinder"".Reuters was not able independently confirm how employees at Tinder were using ChatGPT. Tinder said it provided ""regular guidance to employees on best security and data practices"".In May, Samsung Electronics banned staff globally from using ChatGPT and similar AI tools after discovering an employee had uploaded sensitive code to the platform.""We are reviewing measures to create a secure environment for generative AI usage that enhances employees' productivity and efficiency,"" Samsung said in a statement on Aug. 3.""However, until these measures are ready, we are temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through company devices.""Reuters reported in June that Alphabet had cautioned employees about how they use chatbots including Google's Bard, at the same time as it markets the programme globally.Google said although Bard can make undesired code suggestions, it helps programmers. It also said it aimed to be transparent about the limitations of its technology.BLANKET BANSSome companies told Reuters they are embracing ChatGPT and similar platforms, while keeping security in mind.""We've started testing and learning about how AI can enhance operational effectiveness,"" said a Coca-Cola spokesperson in Atlanta, Georgia, adding that data stays within its firewall.""Internally, we recently launched our enterprise version of Coca-Cola ChatGPT for productivity,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Coca-Cola plans to use AI to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its teams.Tate &amp; Lyle Chief Financial Officer Dawn Allen, meanwhile, told Reuters that the global ingredients maker was trialing ChatGPT, having ""found a way to use it in a safe way"".""We've got different teams deciding how they want to use it through a series of experiments. Should we use it in investor relations? Should we use it in knowledge management? How can we use it to carry out tasks more efficiently?""Some employees say they cannot access the platform on their company computers at all.""It's completely banned on the office network, like it doesn't work,"" said a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.P&amp;G declined to comment. Reuters was not able independently to confirm whether employees at P&amp;G were unable to use ChatGPT.Paul Lewis, chief information security officer at cyber security firm Nominet, said firms were right to be wary.""Everybody gets the benefit of that increased capability, but the information isn't completely secure and it can be engineered out,"" he said, citing ""malicious prompts"" that can be used to get AI chatbots to disclose information.""A blanket ban isn't warranted yet, but we need to tread carefully,"" Lewis said.

Shares of Microsoft were down about 1% on Friday morning in New York.The board’s decision to focus on cloud computing follows a request last month by Senator Ron Wyden to investigate Microsoft’s role in the breach. In a July 27 letter, Wyden asked Attorney General Merrick Garland, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly to investigate Microsoft and hold the company “responsible for its negligent cybersecurity practices.”Story continuesMicrosoft didn’t respond to requests for comment.Wyden, in a statement, said he applauded the decision. “The government will only be able to protect federal systems against cyberattacks by getting to the bottom of what went wrong,” he said.Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, is facing increasing scrutiny from computer security experts and government agencies over its ability to protect customers from breaches. Amit Yoran, the chief executive officer of the cybersecurity company Tenable Holdings Inc., criticized Microsoft, saying on LinkedIn that the company’s “lack of transparency applies to breaches, irresponsible security practices and to vulnerabilities, all of which expose their customers to risks they are deliberately kept in the dark about.”Easterly’s agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security and known as CISA, manages the board and is responsible for convening it after significant cybersecurity events, according to a 2022 statement when the board was established. Following the conclusion of an investigation, the board issues a report detailing what went wrong and makes recommendations for future changes.In an interview, Easterly suggested that Microsoft should “recapture the ethos” of what Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called “trustworthy computing” in 2002, when he instructed employees to focus on security over adding new features.“I absolutely positively think they have to focus on ensuring their products are both secure by default and secure by design, and we are going to continue to work with them to urge them to do that,” Easterly said of Microsoft.The hack of US officials’ email, which included the accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and State Department officials, took place in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to China to meet President Xi Jinping. The hackers got into the networks by taking a Microsoft consumer signing key, which allowed them to obtain access to officials’ emails.“Government emails were stolen because Microsoft committed another error,” Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said in his letter. “Microsoft should not have had a single skeleton key that, when inevitably stolen, could be used to forge access to different customers’ private communications.”Wyden has also pushed for US officials to investigate the so-called SolarWinds attack, saying in his letter that Microsoft “never took responsibility for its role.” In that attack, which was disclosed in 2020, Russian state-sponsored hackers compromised computer networks in the federal government and private sector.SolarWinds was planned as the first investigation carried out by the board, according to the executive order that created it. But that probe never happened. Instead, the board investigated the Log4j software vulnerability and later, the Lapsus$ hacking group, which breached major US companies. The board’s report on Lapsus$ was released on August 10.Wyden said he has been rebuffed in getting CISA and the Department of Homeland Security to direct the board to study the SolarWinds breach.“Had the board studied the 2020 SolarWinds hack, as President Biden originally directed, its findings might have been able to shore up federal cybersecurity in time to stop hackers from exploiting a similar vulnerability in the most recent incident,” Wyden said, in his statement released on Friday.(Updates with additional information in first four paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBrookfield Chases Rivals for Private Equity’s New Money-Spinner‘Don’t You Remember Me?’ The Crypto Hell on the Other Side of a Spam TextThe Legendary, Wildly Profitable QQQ Fund Makes No Money for Its OwnerOne Nassau County Has a Housing Crisis, the Other Nassau County Has a SolutionSam’s Club’s War Against Costco Started With $1.38 Hot Dog Combo©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World.Fast Food Industry: An OverviewFast food provides a quick, tasty meal at a good value. Ever since the introduction of fast food, there has been a consistent rise in demand. Like all other industries, the pandemic posed challenges for the fast food industry. People were social distancing, and the dine-out culture took a hit. However, the fast food industry has been recovering from the impact. In many cases, fast food chains have bounced back even stronger. The fast recovery of the industry can be attributed largely to how quickly the restaurants adapted to the dynamic environment during the pandemic. On March 27, Forbes reported that in the US, 30% of restaurants used online ordering and payment while 26% introduced delivery and takeout services, and 41% of the customers said they were more likely to use these services in 2023, compared to 2019. On January 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that in the US, in 2022, 85% of all orders were taken to go. Many restaurants switched to paperless menus as well. According to a report by IMARC Group, the fast-food industry was valued at $243.9 billion in 2022 and is estimated to grow to $319.7 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 4.7%.  According to a report by Precedence Research, North America dominated the fast food market in 2021 with a revenue share of 28%. The large share in the global market of this region can be attributed to dual-working households and high household incomes. The United States has the highest fast food consumption in the world. The fast food industry in the United States accounts for almost one-third of the overall global fast food market. Mexico has been predicted to have the highest CAGR from 2021 to 2028 which can be attributed to lifestyle changes and increased tourism. According to a report by Zion Market Research, the fast food industry has various segments, including end-user, product type, and region; the end user is further segmented into quick-service restaurants, fast-casual restaurants, and others.Story continuesGlobalization, industrialization, and urbanization have all combined to amplify the demand for fast-food restaurants. Fast food restaurants assemble and sell precooked food, the main factor in their quick service. Despite the rapid recovery from the pandemic and increased consumer spending capacity, fast food restaurants still face challenges like inflation. Food prices are constantly rising, also causing the prices of the end products to increase. On March 8, Bloomberg published an article saying that 60% of the restaurants in the US mentioned that they are understaffed and labor woes are impacting restaurant chains including Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ). According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the food industry is expected to have the highest employment upsurge from 2021 to 2031, adding 1.3 million jobs, mainly to fill the large vacancies created by layoffs during the pandemic.Recent Tech Advancements Fast-food restaurants are incorporating new technological advancements to maximize their efficiency. Many restaurants have started using AI Chatbots to take orders at the drive-thru. On July 10, Bloomberg reported that chatbots can reduce restaurant labor requirements by 40 hours a week. The introduction of AI could significantly impact how the labor market will look like in a few years, as the fast food industry is the fourth largest industry in the US and makes up 8% of all jobs. The trend towards cloud kitchens is also increasing. Fast food restaurants are turning towards automation in production as well. On August 2, Reuters reported that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will roll out an automated coffee-making machine in 10% of its stores by 2024. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) introduced a robot prototype that cuts and peels avocados, reducing prep time by 50%, and a double-sided grill that cooks 70% faster than the normal ones. According to a report by the National Restaurant Association, 58% of restaurant operators are turning towards automation and technology to cater to the looming labor shortages. Tech advancements could potentially change how the fast-food industry will look in a few years. Noteworthy Names In The Fast Food IndustryDespite the possibility of a global recession, the restaurant industry is booming and earnings are showing constant growth. Some of the largest players in the fast food restaurant industry include Restaurant Brands International Inc.(NYSE:QSR), McDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD), and Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ). McDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) is one of the most valuable food companies in the world. Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) has recently reported high earnings despite inflation. Domino's makes pizza taste familiar to consumers by incorporating local flavors into the menu. Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) sells the 49-rupee ($0.60) pizza in India, which is the cheapest pizza in the world. On July 24, the company reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $3.08 and beat EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.02 billion. Here are some comments from the Q2 earnings call regarding how the company plans on increasing its profitability in the long term:""First, pricing. During the second quarter, the average price increase across our US system was 3.9%. We expect average pricing to be similar in the third quarter before moderating in the fourth quarter to approximately 2%, when we left the carryout Mix &amp; Match pricing change from October 2022. Second, cost efficiencies as we continue to drive margin recovery. We drove improvement in our operating income margin, which grew by 240 basis points versus Q2 2022. This was despite foreign exchange rates having a 15 basis points negative year-over-year impact on operating income margin during the quarter.We now expect full-year operating income margins in 2023 to reach or exceed 2019 levels. Third, positive same store sales growth excluding foreign currency impact in our US and international businesses for the third consecutive quarter drove operating income improvement. Now for our financial results for the quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.8% due to positive sales comps and global net store growth. US retail sales increased 1.7%. International retail sales, excluding the negative impact of currency, grew 10.1%. During Q2, same store sales for the US business increased 0.1%. The increase in US same store sales was driven by a higher average ticket, including the pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by order count declines.Our carryout business remained strong in Q2, with same store sales plus 5.6%, rolling over a plus 14.6% performance in 2022. The US delivery business continues to be challenged. Q2 delivery same store sales declined 3.5%, rolling over a minus 11.7% in Q2 2022. We expect Q3 same store sales trends in our delivery business to be challenged, similar to Q2. However, we expect a slight improvement in trend in Q4 as our updated loyalty program begins to roll out, followed by a considerable improvement in 2024 as a result of transaction growth from our Uber Eats partnership and other initiatives Russell has shared with you. Shifting to unit count. We added 27 net new stores in the US with 30 store openings and three closures, bringing our US system store count to 6,735 stores at the end of the quarter and our four quarter net store growth rate in the US to 1.8%.""20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World TMON/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the most popular restaurants in the world, we initially extracted the names of the top 50 fast food restaurants from Technomic's Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report. The list was based on the highest-grossing restaurants in the US. As we pointed out above, the US is the country with the highest fast food consumption in the world which is why we have used this report to form our initial list. We then looked up the number of countries each of these restaurants exists in and ranked the restaurants in ascending order of the number of countries they were present in. This information was gathered from the official sites of each restaurant. The ranking is based on the hypothesis that a restaurant is more popular if it operates in more countries. We have used the number of overall locations for the restaurants operating in the same number of countries as a tiebreaker. 20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World20.

The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Starbucks's ROIC is 14.79, and its WACC is 8.49.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Starbucks is shown below:Is Starbucks (SBUX) Modestly Undervalued?

84,b28571c9-0e0f-3df1-b9ee-ce3d214c513f,ADM,2023-08-11,20 Most Grown Crops In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-grown-crops-world-122547272.html,1691670347,STORY,"['BG', 'ADM', 'DE']","[In this article, we will discuss the most cultivated crops in the world and discuss AI startups that are trying to increase the agriculture sector's efficiency. If you want to skip our analysis of big AgTech names, head straight to the 8 Most Grown Crops In The World. The global agricultural sector intertwines a matrix of value chains that are influenced heavily by the most grown crops in the world. For instance, wheat is a staple food for 2.5 billion people while rice is a staple for 3.5 billion; both crops' demand is expected to increase by 50% and 35% by 2050, respectively. Similarly, the world's one-third population relies on maize (corn) as the primary food. Corn is pivotal for human consumption, and is also used as animal feed and has uses in the production of biofuels. Companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) play significant roles in the international wheat and rice trade. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) possesses a comprehensive grain elevator system in the US that captures a considerable proportion of the country's wheat production. These facilities store and aggregate wheat from farmers, which is then transported through the company's export facilities and processing plants to reach end customers. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is also equipped with storage facilities that receive corn and rice to ensure an uninterrupted supply for its processing plants.Sugarcane, corn, and rice are also among the 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World, as these are cash crops for major agricultural countries.  Advancements in the Global Agriculture Practices The global agriculture industry, as of the last data, accounted for roughly 4% of the world's GDP, with millions depending on it for livelihood. As the world's population is projected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, the demand for food will rise correspondingly. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that to feed the global population; agricultural production must increase by 60% from 2005 levels. Therefore, to meet this increasing demand, the agriculture sector is now turning to advanced technologies like transitioning from basic hand tools to large machinery and, more recently, to precision agriculture. Story continuesFor example, Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) acquired Blue River Technology, an AgTech startup, by cognizing the potential of AI in agriculture. This acquisition equipped Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) with ""See &amp; Spray"" technology which detects weeds among corn, cotton, and soybean plants. When mounted on a tractor, this system by Deere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE) can accurately spray herbicides on weeds and avoid crops, thus reducing chemical use by up to 90%. The technology promises cost savings for farmers and addresses environmental concerns associated with excessive herbicide use.Likewise, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), a global agribusiness and food company, has been keen on advancing the agriculture sector. To keep up with consumer demand, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) has entered into an agreement with Viterra Limited to create an innovative global agribusiness company that will be well-positioned to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets. The merger between Bungee Limited (NYSE:BG) and Viterra Limited will also better serve farmers and customers with an enhanced global network. The organizations will benefit from more diversified capabilities and operational flexibility across oilseed &amp; grain supply chains.FBN is also worth mentioning, an independent and unbiased network of farmers sharing data about their crops, inputs, and practices. AI then analyzes this information to provide members with insights into optimal farming practices and input pricing. The Climate Corporation, acquired by Monsanto, now part of Bayer AG, is another startup that provides digital tools to help farmers analyze weather data, soil health, and field data. The farmers' network can then share actionable insights and understand yield-limiting factors and change their farming practices accordingly.According to AgFund, global investment in food tech and AgTech startups was $29.6 billion in 2022, and more startups are expected to systematize farming.20 Most Grown Crops In The World20 Most Grown Crops In The WorldOur Methodology To find the most cultivated crops in the world, we referred to the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). We ranked the most grown crops based on their production quantity (ascending order) in the 2021/2022 crop year. Notably, we have slightly rounded the production quantity figures to simplify the data and have used the unit of million metric tons for these crops. Based on our findings, here are the 20 most grown crops in the world: 20. PlantainsProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 45.3 million tonsPlantains are starchier relatives of the banana and work as staple foods in many tropical regions. The crop is mostly grown in Africa, where it accounts for 32% of global production, and Uganda is its main producer. Their versatility extends beyond direct consumption, as plantains can be processed into flour, chips, and other value-added products.19. Coconut Production Quantity In The 2021/2022 Crop Year: 64 million tonsAsia is the dominant region for coconut production; namely, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India are its top producers. Coconut's uses are multiple as its liquid is a refreshing drink, its flesh is consumed raw or processed into oil, and the shell and husk have industrial applications. Coconut oil, in particular, has seen a surge in global demand due to its utility in cooking and cosmetics.18. Sorghum Production Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 64.36 million tonsSorghum is a resilient cereal grain grown in arid and semi-arid regions. As of current, Africa produces about 60% of the crop's global yield. Its drought-resistant properties make it a safe crop to ensure food security in challenging environments, and it is consumed as porridge, bread, and beverages. Beyond human consumption, sorghum serves as livestock feed and is increasingly being explored for biofuel production. 17. YamsProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 75.1 million tonsYams are also mostly grown in West Africa, which accounts for over 90% of the crop's growth. Nigeria is the world's largest grower of yams and is responsible for more than 60% of its total yield. Yams are versatile in culinary applications as they are consumed as boiled, fried, roasted, or pounded into a popular dish called pounded yam. 16. OrangesProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 83 million tonsOranges are among the most cultivated fruit crops worldwide, and Brazil is at the forefront of its production, followed by China and India. The majority of the global harvest caters to the juice industry, particularly in Brazil, where the export of orange juice concentrate is a big economic activity. Apart from being consumed fresh or as juice, oranges provide essential oils, peels, and other by-products used in the food and cosmetics industries. 15. GrapesProduction Quantity In The 2021/2022 Crop Year: 84 million tons China, Italy, and the United States produce grapes, both table and wine varieties, owing to the crop's demand. The majority of the grape yield goes into winemaking, a sector with deep economic roots in regions like Bordeaux, Tuscany, and Napa Valley. Notably, wine exports contribute to the economies of France, Italy, and Spain. Beyond viniculture, grapes are consumed fresh, dried as raisins, or processed into juices and jams. 14. Seed CottonProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 90 million tons Seed cotton is the primary source of cotton lint and cottonseed oil. India, China, and the United States dominate in its production and cater to the global textile industry. Notably, China and the US are also among the largest exporters of fabric/garments, owing to their cotton seed yield. The crop's cultivation and processing employ millions, so its value chains extend from agriculture to apparel.13. OnionsProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 130 million tons Onion is one of the most grown and consumed crops in the world. They are essential culinary ingredients and see significant cultivation in China, India, and the United States. Beyond the kitchen, onions have medicinal properties and are used in traditional remedies.

The crop's resilience to challenging growing conditions makes it an attractive choice for regions where climate change is huge. 11. BananasProduction Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 137 million tons Bananas are among the world's most exported fresh fruits, which flourish in tropical and subtropical zones. Ecuador, the Philippines, and Costa Rica are the biggest banana producers and exporters, while Europe and the US are major importers. 10.

China alone contributes to nearly half of the world's apple production. The crop's significant portion goes into processing for juices, cider, and other value-added products. The apple trade represents a multi-billion-dollar industry, as branding and quality assurance play crucial roles in competitive markets. 9. Barley Production Quantity In 2021/2022 Crop Year: 147 million tonsBarley is one of the most grown crops in the world.

""Everyone I know is now homeless.""Such scenes of devastation have become all too familiar elsewhere in the world this summer. Wildfires, often caused by record-setting heat, forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other parts of Europe. In western Canada, a series of unusually severe fires sent clouds of smoke over vast swathes of the U.S., polluting the air.Human-caused climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, is increasing the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events, scientists say, having long warned that government officials must slash emissions to prevent climate catastrophe.On Maui, firefighters were battling three separate blazes on the island, officials said late on Wednesday night, without providing further details.Officials said on Wednesday that the fires also destroyed parts of Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous Upcountry region. Fires were also affecting Kihei in South Maui.Story continuesHawaii's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke told a press conference late on Wednesday that officials were still assessing the damage.""It will be a long road to recovery,"" she said.DISTANT HURRICANE FANNED FLAMESThe blazes began on Tuesday night as powerful winds from Hurricane Dora, hundreds of miles to the southwest, fanned the flames.Some 271 structures were damaged or destroyed, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported, citing official reports from flyovers conducted by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol and the Maui Fire Department.The wildfires spread quickly through populated areas of the city of 13,000 people. Some people were forced to jump into the Pacific Ocean to escape the smoke and fire conditions, prompting the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue them, according to a Maui County press release.Others raced to evacuate as clouds of smoke billowed over once-idyllic beaches and palm trees.""I was the last one off the dock when the firestorm came through the banyan trees and took everything with it. And I just ran out and helped everyone I could along the way,"" said Dustin Johnson, who was in Lahaina Harbor working for a charter boat company that offers two-hour tours. He spoke from Kahului Airport, normally a 25-minute drive east of Lahaina.Officials said they were looking into witness reports of people being trapped in their cars.More than 11,000 travelers were evacuated from Maui, Ed Sniffen of the Hawaii Department of Transportation said late on Wednesday. Though at least 16 roads were closed, the airport was operating fully and airlines were dropping fares and offering waivers to get people off the island, Sniffen had said earlier in the day.A mass bus evacuation to the Kahului Airport for visitors in West Maui was to resume at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, officials said.Southwest Airlines said on Thursday that it was increasing flights to Hawaii due to the evacuation efforts.The National Guard, U.S. Navy, Marines and Coast Guard were mobilized, while the U.S. Department of Transportation aided evacuation efforts, Biden said.The cause in Maui had yet to be determined but the National Weather Service said the fires were fueled by a mix of dry vegetation, strong winds, and low humidity.(Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Frank McGurty, Angus MacSwan and Alex Richardson)]"

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Philip Morris International is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 32%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Tobacco industry average of 18%. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceIn the above chart we have measured Philip Morris International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Philip Morris International here  for free.What Can We Tell From Philip Morris International's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Philip Morris International doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 51%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However it looks like Philip Morris International might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Philip Morris International is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 54% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Philip Morris International, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

We have also discussed key challenges that nurses face today and how some companies are trying to ease those challenge. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Nurses.Nurses, the bedrock of our healthcare system and the most trusted profession in America, currently face an alarming exodus from their profession. The COVID-19 pandemic, like an unforgiving storm, intensified the persistent challenges that nurses have long grappled with and pushed them to a breaking point. These numbers painted a stark and concerning picture as a nationwide study revealed that a 55% of healthcare workers, including nurses, currently struggle with burnout.In this pivotal moment, nurses are not merely cogs in a healthcare machine; they stand as frontline warriors, healers, and caregivers. However, grueling 12-hour shifts, constant pressure, and a lack of autonomy have etched lines of chronic stress and compassion fatigue across their faces. Younger nurses, brimming with potential, bear the weight of feeling undervalued and overwhelmed, as a mere 19% of those under 35 believe their organizations genuinely prioritize their well-being.Adding to this crisis is the troubling fact that nearly 18% of newly licensed registered nurses leave the profession within their first year, their potential curtailed by stressful working conditions and inadequate guidance. However, it is interesting to note that despite these challenges, nurses have the most in-demand job for the future in the US with a growth rate of 46% between 2021 and 2031.Apart from all these challenges, nurses are often underpaid at work. In fact, in countries like Latvia and Lithuania, nurses are paid less than their country’s average wage and thus, the countries have some of the lowest paid nurses in the world. On the brighter side, one of the best and easiest countries for nurses to work is New Zealand.Story continuesTo reduce the work burden of nurses, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) is making efforts to empower and uplift nurses through strategic investments and innovative technology solutions. Since 2019, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) has committed over $300 million towards nurse clinical education, with $46 million allocated to 12 Centers for Clinical Advancement, each equipped with 68 classrooms, 65 simulation rooms, and more than 145 training manikins. This infrastructure enables nurses to engage in hands-on skills training, immersive simulations, and receive mentoring and feedback which in return fosters their skill development and competency.Furthermore, HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) is set to expand its impact by allocating an additional $90 million to establish 20 new nursing clinical advancement centers within the next three years. This expansion aims to enrich the training experience for practicing nurses, helping them refine their expertise and improve patient care. In alignment with this commitment, HCA Healthcare inc (NYSE:HCA) acquisition of Galen College of Nursing in 2020, supported by a $200 million investment, has facilitated access to education and career development for HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) employees, with 3,000 enrolled and 14 new campuses established.On the other hand, In 2022, AMN Healthcare Services Inc (NYSE:AMN) commitment to healthcare professionals was evident through its creation of the ""Caring for Caregivers Fund,"" a $3 million initiative that supported 97 healthcare professionals who were struggling and awarded over $221,000 in aid. AMN Healthcare Services Inc (NYSE:AMN) further extended its reach by introducing travel reimbursement for medical services beyond 100 miles and provided up to $4,000 per occurrence, and a lifetime benefit of $10,000.AMN Healthcare Services Inc (NYSE:AMN)’s emphasis on professional growth was also evident through initiatives such as the AMN-Cornell Leadership Academy, which engaged over 30 high-potential leaders in a six-month virtual program, and the RN.com platform, which offered more than 150 courses to improve nurses' job performance and patient outcomes. With a strong focus on engagement, AMN Healthcare Services Inc (NYSE:AMN) achieved an 87% retention rate by prioritizing team members' well-being, supported by regular surveys, mentorship programs, and learning opportunities.18 Highest Paying Countries for NursesMonkey Business Images/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the highest paying countries for nurses, we identified the highest paying countries for healthcare professionals and then made a list for 25 countries with the average salaries for registered nurses.

GPN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GPNGlobal Payments is a leading provider of payment processing and software solutions, primarily serving small and midsize merchants. The company operates in 30 countries, generating about a quarter of its revenue from outside North America, mainly in Europe and Asia.

The merger added issuer processing operations and gave Total System Services shareholders 48% of the combined company's shares.Is Global Payments Inc. (GPN) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisUnderstanding the GF Value of Global PaymentsThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is estimated to be modestly undervalued, according to the GF Value. The stock's fair value is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. Currently, at a price of $128.96 per share, Global Payments has a market cap of $33.50 billion, and the stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued.Story continuesIs Global Payments Inc.

These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing the Financial Strength of Global PaymentsFinancial strength is a crucial factor to consider before investing in a company's stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great indicators of a company's financial strength. Global Payments has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11, which is worse than 83.46% of companies in the Business Services industry. The overall financial strength of Global Payments is 4 out of 10, indicating that the financial strength of Global Payments is poor.Is Global Payments Inc. (GPN) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisProfitability and Growth of Global PaymentsInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Global Payments has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $9.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3. Its operating margin of 17.66% is better than 82.88% of companies in the Business Services industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Global Payments's profitability as strong.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Global Payments is 9.7%, which ranks better than 67.01% of companies in the Business Services industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -0.3%, which ranks worse than 70.34% of companies in the Business Services industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Global Payments's ROIC was 2.93, while its WACC came in at 7.32.Is Global Payments Inc. (GPN) Modestly Undervalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) is estimated to be modestly undervalued.

109,ece90d9a-4315-3bae-a289-795f21013ec5,NFLX,2023-08-11,Disney's Latest Quarterly Report Was Magic-Free,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disneys-latest-quarterly-report-magic-151505879.html,1691680505,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[On Wednesday, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) reported a mixed fiscal third quarter. Although its flagship sports network ESPN struck a $2 billion deal with Penn Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ: PENN) to launch ESPN Bet, a branded sportsbook, Disney is facing a streaming slowdown while undergoing massive restructuring. But, there are still no signs that magic has been restored at its entertainment kingdom.Financial HighlightsRevenue for the quarter that ended in July amounted to $22.33 billion as it rose 4% YoY, but below the $22.5 billion that Refinitiv expected. Due to $2.65 billion in one-time charges and “content impairments that came as a result of Disney pulling off content and ending third-party licensing agreements, the entertainment company made a rare quarterly net loss that amounted to $460 million, or 25 cents per share. The adjusted EPS per share $1.03 per share, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of 95 cents.StreamingThe entertainment giant lost streaming subscribers as total subscriptions for Disney+ amounted to 146.1 million, translating to a drop of 7.4% which was worse than Wall Street expected as analysts anticipated 151.1 million. The majority of losses were a result of losing the rights to Indian Premier League cricket matches which costed Disney+ Hotstar a 24% drop in users. As Disney continues to work on cutting $5.5 billion in costs this year, streaming losses amounted to $512 million, significantly beating estimates of $777 million and marking a great improvement from last year’s comparable quarter when it lost $1.1 billion.Parks And ExperiencesThe division that suffered the most during the pandemic was a rare bright spot of this report as its revenue rose 13% to $8.3 billion, owed mainly to international parks as domestic ones, especially in Florida, experienced a slowdown. The similar trend was reported by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) for its Florida-based theme parks.  Iger remains hyper-focused on profitability, possibly risking his legacyStory continuesCapital expenditures for the full year are expected to amount to $5 billion, lowering the prior guidance of $6 billion. In response to losing users and falling revenue, Disney will be raising the price of its ad-free streaming offering in October. It will also follow the footsteps of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) by cracking down on password sharing.All in all, Disney CEO Bob Iger only got to retire for 11 months and his return will last even longer than initially expected as its latest contract ends in 2026. Iger has difficult tasks on his hands, from the slumping TV business, streaming losses and the striking writers and actors. The once America’s most beloved CEO is now facing criticism for stating that the creative community has unrealistic expectations and for soullessly cutting costs. Meanwhile, its streaming rival, Netflix, ventured into cloud gaming amid content shutdown, as a strategy to increase engagement. Netflix is considered as the number one enemy in the ongoing strike yet the streaming king somewhat insulated itself from the content pause. Unlike Disney+, Netflix is enjoying record subscriber numbers and it owes to its expansion, international production and crackdown on password sharing. For now, the strike of writers and actors is taking less of a tool on Netflix than on Disney so Iger certainly hasn’t lost his touch by choosing the follow Netflix’s footsteps. The only problem is, it might cost him the adoration he enjoyed throughout his long-spanning career.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The company announced on its earnings call that it will be raising the prices of its streaming services and begin to crack down on password sharing in 2024, following the likes of streaming competitors such as Netflix (NFLX).Truist Securities Analyst Matthew Thornton tells Yahoo Finance Live a lot of streaming services, including Disney, ""are really thinking through what are the right price points, what is the right tiering structure, how do we lay in advertising in an accretive way?"" Thornton states subscriber growth numbers won't just sit at numbers from years prior because ""the law of large numbers are starting to set in here.""Video Transcript- Disney reported mixed results for its third quarter after the bell on Wednesday, missing expectations for revenue but beating on earnings per share. Disney's stock higher today after initially dipping in after hours trading. Joining us now, we've got Matthew Thornton, who's the Truist Securities analyst. Matthew, great to have you here with us this morning. How should investors look at Disney's stock after this report?MATTHEW THORNTON: Look, I think we got some positive incremental takeaways here. I mean, the focus for this company right now is clearly profit and cash flow over revenue and subscriber growth, at least for the short term. And if you look at what we got yesterday, in the streaming business, profit was better, particularly on pricing. Subs were weaker, but I think that should be and probably was expected.The linear TV business continues to struggle from a secular perspective. But again, I don't think that's new. The box office remains challenging and lumpy. Again, I don't think that's new. And the parks businesses, look, I think you've got some puts and takes. International strong domestic softening from really, really tough comparisons year over year.Story continuesBut I think the probably more important incrementals here are, you know, the company talked about raising price in the streaming business probably a little more aggressively than folks expected. They talked about cracking down on password sharing, very similar to what Netflix has done. They introduced a new sports betting partnership yesterday, and they said that their cost actions are actually running ahead of plan. So they're going to do better than that $5.5 billion.So I think if you kind of wrap that all up, profit numbers are probably stable to maybe even rising coming out of this earnings results.- I want to focus in-- Matthew, it's Julie here-- on the streaming business in particular. And you said-- you mentioned that they sort of follow in the heels of Netflix here in terms of talking about password sharing crackdown. Although it sounds like they haven't done it quite yet. Raising pricing, offering more tiers. This-- it sort of feels like after Netflix lost its mojo, it feels like it's gotten it back and then some.And then now, there's sort of an also ran situation where the other streamers are maybe running to catch up with Netflix at this point. Is that your impression, and are they going to be able to catch up?MATTHEW THORNTON: I think it's a maturation of the streaming market. I think we've had the last, you know, four or five years of, you know, pure focus on subscriber growth and gaining scale. And I think we are now getting to a point where penetration rates are higher, where there's a much more balanced approach to monetization and profitability. And so I think a lot of these services Disney included are really thinking through what are the right price points, what is the right tiering structure. How do we lay in advertising in a creative way?Because subscriber growth isn't going to be at the levels that we've seen in prior years. Because the law of large numbers are starting to set in here. So I think it's a very natural maturation process across the streaming landscape.- And so this is still a company as well that has a lot of kind of changeover that's taking place at this time. Either in strategy that's enacted or just in terms of what the experience for a myriad of consumers that they deal with looks like as well. But what's caught investors' attention is whether or not there could be parts of this company that are eventually sold off. Do you see that coming to fruition? Is there anything that you heard on the call that gives you the inclination to believe that we could be looking at a far different Disney or part of a Disney that gets sold off to some other company over the next, say, 12 months to 18 months?MATTHEW THORNTON: I think what's pretty clear here is there's a lot of optionality. And I think CEO Bob Iger, you know, made that point pretty clear. If you look at kind of what the core is of this company, it really is their tried and true owned and operated brands. So the Disney brands, the Marvel brands, the Star Wars brands, the Pixar brands. Which, of course, extend to their portfolio of parks and cruises and experiences.That is the core of this company. That is the growth driver. That is the highest margin, highest value piece of this company. I think where the optionality really lies is around their linear networks business, and of course, ESPN and the sports ecosystem. And I think they were pretty clear that. Within ESPN, they are preparing for a transition to a streaming world. They are looking at strategic partners that can help them on the content or distribution side.And so what I think that tells you is they are hard at work pen and paper, you know, trying to figure out where they want to take this business. And it could look very different. And when you think about the legacy networks business, so if you think like ABC and FX some of the linear channels, I think, again, all cards are on the table here. And that could include a sale or spinoff of those assets.So I think the point here-- we don't want to get over our skis. But the point here is there's a lot of optionality, a lot of work being done, a lot of conversations being had.- Matthew, bottom line. I know you're buying the stock. But given what we heard specifically from the company on the call and in the report, would you be buying that stock today on what you heard?MATTHEW THORNTON: Look, I think the setup here for the stock is better today than it was yesterday. And then the reason I say that is, again, I think the result that we saw yesterday were better than feared. I think profit numbers are probably stable to going up coming out of this print. We have an investor day-- a three-day investor event that they'll host next month where we'll get more incremental color.And I think sentiment in general, you know, could swing in a couple different areas if you think about the ongoing strikes. I think sentiment's clearly pinned negative there. If you think about box office choppiness, you know, those are things that can go back the other way pretty quickly. So we actually think the setup today is better than it was 24 hours ago.- And then just one quick final question on the parks, and specifically on Disney World in Florida. What's going on there? Like, what's really going on there? And are we going to see a rebound in the traffic there?MATTHEW THORNTON: I think it's a combination of several things. I think you've got really tough comparables. Remember, they had their 50th anniversary promotions and events last year. You're starting to anniversary those. I think, you know, when you think about 2022 into 2023, I think there was a lot of catch-up vacationing because of what happened during the pandemic. And that's starting to moderate and normalize here.And so I think it's a law of large numbers and a lot of normalizing of demand and tough comparables that you're seeing in Walt Disney World. I think conversely, if you look at perhaps Disneyland but certainly more so international parks where the pandemic's extended a little bit longer, so we're still much earlier in that catch-up phase. Those are still outperforming and exceeding expectations. Cruise lines are another great example there. So I think they're in part different parts of the curve getting back to kind of a normalization.]"

In July, the company confirmed it had gained 5.9 million new subscribers because people were being forced to cough up for their own accounts—marking a subscriber increase of 8% for the second quarter of 2023.That translated to sales growth of $8.2 billion for the quarter—and although Wall Street remained unimpressed by Netflix’s results, it’s the sort of turnaround Iger wants to start seeing at the House of Mouse.“We are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family,” he told analysts on the call. “Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies.“Iger did not reveal what those changes would look like, or how closely Disney would follow Netflix’s lead.The recently reinstated CEO did add, however, that unlike Netflix—which axed its lowest-price ad-free option this summer—Disney will not be upping prices on Disney+ and Hulu ad-supported accounts.“Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us,” he said.However, Iger has hiked prices for subscribers who don’t want to deal with ads. From Oct. 12, ad-free Disney+ subscriptions will be increasing by 27% to $13.99 a month, while Hulu without commercials will increase 20% to $17.99.Story continuesDisney reported 146.1 million total Disney+ subscribers for the third quarter—a 7.4% decline from the previous quarter, and a larger loss than Wall Street had been anticipating.Clawing back lossesThe Disney+ price hikes and a clampdown on password sharing may be necessary to fill a near half-a-billion-dollar hole in the company’s finances.Iger also hinted at spinning off some of Disney’s linear networks during the earnings call, which he has previously said may not be “core” to the company’s business.Disney confirmed it had seen an overall loss of $460 million in the three months to July, compared with a $1.4 billion profit for the same period a year earlier.The loss was largely down to a $2.7 billion hit from restructuring and impairment charges.Shortly after returning as chief executive, Iger announced that Disney would undergo a major restructuring—including layoffs—in a bid to save $5.5 billion a year.Despite the additional costs, however, Disney’s revenue continued to grow—rising 4% from $21.5 billion in its second quarter to $22.3 billion in the third quarter—and Iger appeared optimistic about the company’s long-term future.“As I’ve said before, our progress will not always be linear,” the boomerang CEO noted on Disney’s earnings call. “But despite near-term headwinds, I’m incredibly confident in Disney’s long-term trajectory because of the work we’ve done, the team we have in place, and because of Disney’s core intellectual property foundation.”Unexpected bumps in the road are forming part of Iger’s narrative in his second tenure as CEO, after he returned to the helm of the entertainment giant last year in a bid to save the company.These include the ongoing Hollywood strikes, which have seen thousands of writers and actors take to the picket lines over pay, working conditions, and concerns related to the use of A.I. in the film industry.While Iger has publicly slammed the strikers’ demands as “disturbing” and not “realistic,” he insisted during the earnings call that “nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community.”“It is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result,” he said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

And I'm not going to give you a specific number, except to say that it's significant.

In May, the streaming company started asking people to stop sharing accounts outside their households and pay for additional accounts globally.Streaming companies are in a tough spot as they battle stagnant subscriber growth and tough economic conditions. The major players are looking at both price hikes and strategies, like restrictions on password sharing and introducing a cheaper ad-supported tier to attract more subscribers. Disney also announced sizable increases for its streaming subscriptions, due to come into effect later in the year.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/after-netflix-disney-is-cracking-down-on-password-sharing/]"

The company’s two remaining dry mills in Columbus, NE, and Cedar Rapids, IA, are among the largest in the United States. They have a combined capacity to produce 613 million gallons of ethanol per year.As the world faces the challenges posed by greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of fossil fuel resources, transitioning to renewable energy sources is vital. Renewable energy has become increasingly important in the global fight against climate change.Many states in the United States have developed low-carbon fuel markets, which benefit fuel producers for developing motor fuels with less carbon emissions. They can gain appraisal for producing fuels with lower carbon intensity than refining crude oil.Phillips 66 plans to start making renewable fuels at a Rodeo, CA, refinery next year. The refinery will no longer produce fuels from crude oil but convert processing fats, used cooking oils and soybean oils into renewable diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.Axens provides technology solutions to convert oil and biomass into low-carbon fuels. The company will provide its ethanol-to-fuel conversion technology to either Phillips 66, Archer Daniels or a joint venture between the companies.Based in Houston, TX, Phillips 66’s operations incorporate refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals. The company is on track to enhance its potential in every business segment by streamlining its portfolio of assets and by investing in growth developments.Phillips 66 currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the energy sector may look at the following companies that presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This underperformance resulted from weak results in the Liquids Pipelines, and Power and Storage segments.By 2024, TRP plans to maintain business growth at 3-5% and limit annual net capital expenditure to C$6-C$7 billion. It also considers lowering leverage and returning additional capital to shareholders.Crestwood Equity Partners LP CEQP reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.16 per unit, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Strong quarterly earnings resulted from fantastic contributions from the Storage and Logistics business unit.For this year, the partnership projects adjusted EBITDA of $780-$860 million.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The underperformance could be attributed to a fall in the retail gasoline price and fuel contribution, partly offset by higher-than-expected petroleum product sales.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.6 billion fell 17.5% year over year and came below the consensus mark by $22 million.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 5.5% year over year and outperformed our estimate of $994 million. Revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.5 billion, ahead of our estimate of $4.4 billion but down 21.8% from the second quarter of 2022.Murphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Murphy USA Inc. Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution fell 13.5% year over year to $365.8 million despite a slight margin improvement. This could be attributed to a drop in total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results), which came in at 29.5 cents per gallon, 15.5% lower than the second quarter of 2022.Retail fuel contribution increased 4.3% year over year to $334.7 million as margins, at 27 cents per gallon, edged up 1.9% from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 2.3% from the year-ago period to 1,238.8 million in the quarter under review but missed our projection of 1,241.9 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) dropped 1.1% from the second quarter of 2022 to 245.2 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.21 per gallon, down from $4.21 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 5.1% to $206.8 million on higher sales, which more than offset the marginal fall in unit margins, from 19.8% a year ago to 19.7% in the second quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 2.8% year over year, primarily on the back of 2.9% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 2.7% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were down 0.6% from the prior-year period, though merchandise sales increased 2.9% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Jun 30, Murphy USA — which opened seven new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,725 — had cash and cash equivalents of $92.9 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 70.4%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $95.1 million.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s second-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.87, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to lower expenses. The positives were partially offset by PSX’s declining refining margins worldwide.For the reported quarter, Phillips 66 generated $955 million of net cash from operations, down from $1.8 billion a year ago. PSX’s capital expenditure and investments totaled $551 million. It paid out dividends of $474 million in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $3 billion. Meanwhile, Phillips 66 reported total debt of $19.9 billion, reflecting a consolidated debt to capitalization of 39%.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The EPS of $5.40 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.08. This was on account of VLO’s increased renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total costs of sales.At the end of the second quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.3 billion. Valero’s second-quarter capital investment was $458 million. Of the total, $382 million was allotted for sustaining the business.Finally, we have Marathon Petroleum MPC. It reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.32, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 on the back of lower costs and expenses. In the second quarter, MPC repurchased $3.1 billion of shares and a further $800 million worth of shares in July. The company currently has a remaining authorization of $6.3 billion.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, MPC had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.3%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PLCE is likely to witness declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $341.7 million, suggesting a decline of 10.3% from the prior-year reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly loss per share has been unchanged at $2.04 over the past 30 days. It suggests a significant widening from a loss of 89 cents per share reported in the year-ago period.In the last reported quarter, the children's specialty apparel retailer recorded a negative earnings surprise of 13%. It delivered a negative earnings surprise of 63.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Children's Place, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Children's Place, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Children's Place, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Children's Place, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteThe Children’s Place has been grappling with soft consumer demand due to unprecedented inflation, increased promotional activity from key competitors and supply-chain issues. This, along with higher airfreight expenses, container costs and elevated marketing spend, is expected to have dented the fiscal second-quarter performance.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected second-quarter fiscal 2023 net sales to be $340-$345 million, indicating a 10% decline from the year-ago reported figure. It expects the gross margin to decline 200 bps. The company envisions the quarterly adjusted operating loss to be -8% of net sales. The adjusted net loss per share is anticipated to be $2.15-$2.20 in the fiscal second quarter.Rising operating costs and expenses have also been major concerns for the company. A spike in cotton prices and other input costs, coupled with inflation-wary shoppers, has been resulting in elevated cost of sales for the company. This has been weighing on the company’s gross margin performance. Additionally, deleveraging of fixed costs and planned higher marketing spend have been resulting in higher SG&amp;A expenses.Our model estimates adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, to increase 200 basis points (bps) to 71.8% in the fiscal second quarter. Consequently, the gross margin is expected to decline 200 bps to 28.2%. We predict the adjusted SG&amp;A expense rate to increase 320 bps to 33% in the to-be-reported quarter. This, combined with a reduced gross margin, is estimated to result in an operating margin of -8.2%.However, PLCE’s accelerated fleet optimization initiative, directing resources toward digital platforms to better engage with customers, augmenting the supply chain and concentrating on improving financial flexibility bode well.The Children’s Place has been making efforts to get back on track by focusing on its superior products, digital transformation, wholesale &amp; international expansion and fleet optimization. Investments to upgrade its omni-channel capabilities as part of its Digital Transformation strategy are likely to have contributed to the fiscal second-quarter performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for The Children's Place this time around.

118,f675acdf-34e2-3602-a5ba-754fad6eb4a5,AMGN,2023-08-11,Amgen Inc. (AMGN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-attracting-investor-130006372.html,1691672406,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +14.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.72 per share, indicating a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.29 points to a change of +3.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.54 indicates a change of +6.9% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.4%. The $27.12 billion and $30.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3% and +14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Anticipated peak summer demand is expected to be in mid-August.PSE&amp;G Station North Brunswick exteriorAugust 14 will mark the 20th anniversary of the 2003 Northeast blackout. The blackout originated in Ohio, left 50 million people across the northeast without power and stopped in PSE&amp;G's service territory. Of the 750,000 PSE&amp;G customers that lost power that day, nearly three-quarters were back online within five hours and virtually all had service noon the next day. Diversification and design protections helped to contain the outage, and PSE&amp;G personnel safely reenergized the system, circuit by circuit.Since the 2003 blackout, PSE&amp;G has spent billions of dollars to further enhance the reliability and resiliency of its transmissions and distribution systems with the aim of leaving no one in the dark.""PSE&amp;G has a strong track record for providing safe, reliable utility service and this unprecedented blackout was a critical point in our industry,"" said Kim Hanemann, PSE&amp;G president and chief operating officer. ""Millions of people benefited from changes to federal policy after the 2003 blackout that enabled additional necessary investment into the US transmission grid. For PSE&amp;G, it resulted in twenty years of infrastructure investments designed to create a more reliable and resilient grid while strengthening New Jersey's critical energy infrastructure and economy.""This year is no exception. PSE&amp;G's 2023 planned capital expenditures of more than $3.5 billion is the largest investment plan in the utility's history.""Our investments in new infrastructure have helped us remain one of the nation's most reliable utility companies, bringing significant benefits to PSE&amp;G customers,"" said John Latka, PSE&amp;G senior vice president – electric transmission and distribution. ""We have received numerous reliability awards and just last year for the first time ever, J.D. Power named PSE&amp;G number one in customer satisfaction for both Residential Electric and Natural Gas Service in the East among Large Utilities.""Story continuesWhile advances in technology provide critical new tools, PSE&amp;G's most vital asset is a highly skilled, dedicated and motivated workforce. Some examples of projects completed this year that will have a big impact on electric reliability include:Newark Switching Station, which is the heart of PSE&amp;G's Newark transmission/distribution network, services many critical customers including municipal, state and federal offices, several event venues, mass transit, multiple colleges/universities and more. The $350 million Newark Switch Rebuild Project modernized the aging infrastructure that was put into service in 1957, while also increasing reliability by redistributing crucial loads to other facilities when needed.The $550 million Roseland – Pleasant Valley Project was completed in May and is one of PSE&amp;G's largest transmission projects to date. The 51-mile undertaking replaced older transmission facilities that were, on average, approximately 90 years old.Expanding our growing 69kV network statewide. We have completed a number of substation hardening and transformer replacement projects to maintain reliability and have completed circuit upgrades to improve the reliability of 561 distribution circuits that serve over 1.1 million customers across the state.""Each year, we strengthen our distribution system so that fewer customers experience outages and, when they do occur, the duration is shorter,"" said Latka. ""One major effort this year involved adding more smart devices across the state to bolster safety, resiliency and reliability.""Current projects: Through Dec. 2023, PSE&amp;G is also implementing a number of significant reliability projects under its $842 million Energy Strong II program including: Raising and hardening equipment in 16 stations located in flood zones.Upgrading to smart grid technologies to reduce the number of people impacted by an outage (rerouting electricity quickly around problems), enable swifter deployment of repair teams and reduce outage durations.Storm hardening of certain circuits to reduce power outages by adding measures such as upgraded poles and cables that are more resistant to tree and limb damage.Creating an advanced distribution management system to make the system smarter, improve outage response and upgrade and secure vital communications networks.Prepared for Additional Power Demand:This summer's forecasted peak is 9,904 megawatts. Last year's peak was 10,147 megawatts, set on August 9, 2022.PSE&amp;G is prepared to deliver additional power to meet this summer's peak load, and our utility crews are ready to respond to service interruptions should they occur.The utility's rigorous preparedness program for summer includes: conducting annual hurricane and tropical storm drills; employee training; developing emergency summer operating plans and performing summer peak reliability analysis; helicopter and climbing inspections of transmission circuits; infrared inspections; audits and inventories; equipment repairs and replacements; system reinforcements, and transmission line work. We continually refine our emergency preparedness program to ensure we maintain the highest possible level of reliability for our customers.PSE&amp;GPublic Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. is New Jersey's oldest and largest gas and electric delivery public utility, as well as one of the nation's largest utilities.

In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenues of $185.9 million.Quarter in DetailNovavax is currently marketing different versions of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine — one marketed in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (Serum) under the trade name Covovax and another version produced by Novavax that is marketed under the trade name Nuvaxovid. In the United States, the vaccine is marketed as Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted.During the quarter, the company recorded product sales of $285.2 million of product sales, which were significantly higher than the product sales of $55.5 million in the year-ago quarter.

The downside was primarily caused by reduced clinical and manufacturing spending during the quarter.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were down 13% year over year to $94 million. The downside can be attributed to the company’s spending reduction following the cost reduction plan initiated during the second quarter.Story continuesAs of Jun 30, 2023, Novavax had $518 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $637 million as of Mar 31, 2023.2023 GuidanceManagement revised its sales guidance for the full year 2023.Novavax lowered its total revenues forecast to $1.3-$1.5 billion, down from the previously issued guidance of $1.4-$1.6 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2023 revenues stood at $1.44 billion.Noavavax’s shares lost 3.9% on Aug 8 likely due to the lowering of the revenue guidance. In the year so far, Novavax’s stock has declined 29.7% compared with the industry’s 13.1% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement guidance for combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses remained unchanged at $1.3-$1.4 billion.During the Q2 earnings call, Novavax’s chief financial officer (CFO) James Kelly stated that if the 2023 guidance is successfully achieved, it expects the current cash balance and expected cash flow to fund its business operations for the next 12 months.In the interview with CNBC, CEO Jacobs also noted that Novavax expects to generate minimal product sales in third-quarter 2023. Management expects to record product sales during the fourth quarter, provided the FDA authorizes/approves its updated COVID vaccine.Deal With SK bioscienceAlongside its second-quarter results, Novavax also announced that it has signed a new strategic partnership agreement with SK bioscience, one of the contract-based manufacturers of the company’s COVID vaccines.By entering into this agreement, Novavax settled $195 million in manufacturing liabilities with SK bioscience. In return, the former will issue 6.5 million of its common stock to the latter along with a net cash payment of $65 million. Management has also extended the exclusive commercial rights granted to SK bioscience for its COVID-19 vaccine in South Korea till February 2029.Recent UpdatesManagement is focused on delivering an updated COVID-19 vaccine, targeting the XBB subvariant, for the upcoming 2023 fall vaccination season, which is consistent with public health recommendations. Alongside its Q2 results, Novavax announced that it has initiated a filing for the updated vaccine with the FDA, with similar applications expected to be filed in Europe and Canada in the coming weeks.In May, Novavax reported positive top-line results from a phase II study of its investigational COVID-19-influenza combination (CIC) vaccine. Based on this data, Novavax has decided to make strategic stage gate investments in 2023 and 2024 to advance the CIC vaccine to late-stage development. It intends to enter into strategic collaborations and/or available financing alternatives to finance the late-stage development of the CIC candidate.Last month, Novavax announced that it had received full authorization for Nuvaxovid in the European Union as a primary series in individuals aged 12 years and older and as a booster in adults aged 18 years and older.

Whether the electricity is developed from traditional methods of burning fossil fuels or renewable sources such as wind, water, and sunlight, utilities serve a critically important purpose in communities around the world.But this does not mean that utilities make good investments. In fact, utility stocks have been some of the worst investments of the past few years. Many utility companies are experiencing challenges as they try to transition to renewable forms of electricity generation, struggling with high costs, regulatory red tape, and shareholders’ impatience.As a result, the stocks of major utilities have been trending lower and become poor investment choices. A slowing global economy isn’t helping matters either. Here is a sell alert for three utilities stocks to dump ASAP.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Water Works (AWK)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comAmerican Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a public utility that provides water and wastewater services to 1,700 communities in 14 states. Collectively, 14 million Americans are served by American Water Works. Despite its reach, American Water Works’ stock has been under pressure, having declined 10% over the past year, including a 7% pullback in 2023. The company’s share price hit an all-time high in December 2021 and has since fallen 22%.In July, analysts at Guggenheim Partners lowered their price target on AWK stock to $147 a share from $152 previously. This followed a similar downgrade by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which dropped its price target on American Water Works’ stock to $139 from $140 and slapped the security with a “sell” rating. Analysts cite concerns about a difficult regulatory environment and high valuation as the reasons for their downgrades.AWK stock is currently trading at 30 times future earnings, making it a utility stock to dump.Story continuesNextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization in the U.S. Among its subsidiaries is Florida Power &amp; Light. The company has annual revenues approaching $20 billion and 15,000 employees. Yet NEE stock has also been challenged, down 18% in the last 12 months, including a 15% decline this year. The share price also peaked in December 2021 and has since dropped 25%.NextEra Energy’s stock is more attractively valued than AWK stock, trading as it does at 17 times forward earnings. NEE stock also offers shareholders a decent quarterly dividend payment of 47 cents a share, which equates to a yield of 2.65%.However, these facts have not been enough to move the needle on the company’s shares in a positive direction. Concerns have been raised about the company’s growing push into renewable energy sources and the attendant expense. NextEra is the world’s largest generator of energy from the wind and sun.Brookfield Renewable (BEP)A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockA Toronto-based company, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is also a major producer of renewable energy, owning more than 200 hydroelectric plants, 100 wind farms, and over 550 solar facilities. While environmentalists might sing the praises of Brookfield Renewable, investors have been taking a pass on the stock. Over the last 12 months, BEP stock has lost 30% of its value. The shares are currently trading 37% below their 52-week high.While many analysts praise Brookfield Renewable’s dividend that yields more than 4%, the stock has been challenged by inconsistent earnings and heavy spending on developing its renewable energy assets. The company must also run a gauntlet of costly and time consuming regulatory hurdles to bring new projects online. These issues help explain why BEP stock has been trending lower over the last year, raising a sell alert for this utility stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

CAH is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 results on Aug 15, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 17.6%. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 12.28%.Q4 EstimatesFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.48 per share, indicating an improvement of 41% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The same for revenues is pinned at $52.41 billion, implying growth of 11.3% year over year.Factors to NoteCardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment is one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. In the third quarter, revenues from this segment amounted to approximately $46.8 billion, up 14% on a year-over-year basis. The performance reflects branded pharmaceutical sales growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions segment. This segment’s profit was also up 23%. This momentum is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.The company’s generics program sales were also strong during the last reported quarter and its upcoming results are expected to gain from this trend.In April, Cardinal Health opened two new distribution centers in Central Ohio to support U.S. Medical Products and Distribution, and at-Home Solutions businesses. Last year, the company had opened a new distribution center in the Columbus, OH area, lending support to its at-Home Solutions business.CAH is also focused on improving patient engagement and clinical pharmacy solutions. In June, it signed an agreement to contribute its Outcomes business to BalcRock’s Transaction Data Systems for integrated offering of pharmacy workflow software using patient engagement and clinical solutions. The idea was to create additional opportunities for pharmacists and enable better access for payers. In May, Cardinal Health launched modern payment solutions to increase the operational efficiency of independent pharmacies.Story continuesThese developments are likely to have favored CAH’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Moreover, new distribution centers might have helped alleviate supply-chain challenges.For the Medical segment, a decrease in product and distribution volumes as well as pricing led to lower revenues in the previously reported quarter. Earnings were also hurt by net inflationary impacts. The company expects profit for this segment to decline 50% in fiscal 2023. Earnings and revenues are expected to have declined in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, demand for CAH’s at-Home Solutions remained strong during the past couple of quarters. The company had launched a supply-chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution — Velocare — for providing critical products and services required for hospital-level care at home. This strong performance is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.Earnings Beat LikelyOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Cardinal Health this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.10% for Cardinal Health.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cardinal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Cardinal Health, Inc.

The company intends to follow up patients in the study for 24 months following completion of the enrollment. It expects to file primary data from the study to support a Premarket Approval application to the FDA after six months.Price PerformanceShares of Merit Medical have lost 1.8% year to date against the industry’s growth of 16.4%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 18.5% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of the StudyThe WAVE study is comparing WRAPSODY to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as a potential treatment for stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion (blockage) of blood vessels in the venous outflow circuit in patients undergoing hemodialysis.A long-term vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis is achieved with the creation and maintenance of AVF/AVG in blood vessels. However, stenosis/occlusion in the blood vessel used for AVF/AVG can prevent delivery of hemodialysis that may lead to life-threatening consequences. The WRAPSODY device is being developed to help physicians treat patients with stenosis/occlusion.The currently available treatment options to maintain vascular access in hemodialysis patients have inadequate response. WRAPSODY, on the other hand, has the potential to provide better maintenance of AVF/AVG due to its unique cell-impermeable stent covering.The WRAPSODY device has already achieved CE-mark in Europe and is also available in Brazil. While the device is not available commercially in the United States, it is being used in the country under an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global dialysis market was valued at $91,205.0 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $129,756.8 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 4.7%. Factors like an increase in number of diabetic and hypertension patients, a rise in the number of end-stage renal disease patients and a preference over kidney transplantation are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the successful development of WRAPSODY is expected to provide a significant boost to Merit Medical’s business in the niche space.Notable DevelopmentsIn July, Merit Medical announced second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an encouraging year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company witnessed revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories in its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also recorded. Expansion of gross margin buoys optimism.In June, MMSI completed the acquisition of a portfolio of dialysis catheter products and the BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System from AngioDynamics. Management believes that these acquisitions will likely strengthen its position in the dialysis and biopsy markets, besides expanding its specialty dialysis device offering.In March, the company announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -0.55% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.71%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.74%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.62%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 18.3% from last year. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.45%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 29%. This means it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for BK for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.86 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.88%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend.

If exponential growth continues, women will have equal representation to men in these roles between 2030 and 2037, according to the research. While these findings are encouraging, the report also cites work from the World Economic Forum that indicates parity at a broader scale is still more than a century away.Key findings of the report include:Women held 21.9% of all board and C-suite positions in companies in the Russell 3000 Index at the end of 2021, which is up from 9.5% in 2010. Extrapolating at current trends, companies in the Russell 3000 would reach gender parity in senior leadership roles between 2030 and 2037.The majority of progress towards gender parity is coming from women taking seats on company boards. Parity among C-suite leadership may not occur until mid-21st century; and parity at the highest levels in CEO and CFO positions could take even longer, with the current percentage of women CEOs in North America at 7%, behind Europe at 7.9%.During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, women in leadership positions grew by only 1.7% rather than the estimated rate of 2.5%. This suggests that women's careers were generally hit harder than their male counterparts during COVID-19.""This is a small subset of the job market where women have made massive advancements, and the numbers continue to gain momentum,"" said Daniel J. Sandberg, PhD, CFA, Head of Quantamental Research at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and co-author of the report. ""Our previous research has shown the powerful impact that a diverse workforce can have on the profitability and long-term value of a firm. This new data suggests firms are taking notice and building a pipeline for the next generation of female leaders in senior leadership and C-suite roles.""Story continuesFigure 1: Women’s Representation Rate in Senior Leadership Positions; Source: S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Quantamental Research. Data as at 03/03/2023, based on Russell 3000 companies, 2010-2021 (Actual); 2022-2035 (Extrapolated).These findings build upon the team's previous research around the performance of companies with women in CEO and CFO positions, which found that firms which appointed women leaders had subsequent positive performance, higher profitability, and superior stock returns.""We hope this report illuminates an encouraging development in the pursuit of gender parity for companies' senior leaders,"" said Lindsey Hall, Head of Thought Leadership, S&amp;P Global Sustainable1. ""C-suite parity is not projected to be reached until closer to the middle of the century, but companies can make proactive efforts now to bolster and invest in the development and growth of women leaders at an earlier stage in their career.""The research was conducted by S&amp;P Global and includes an analysis of 86,000 executives across 7,300 U.S. firms in the Russell 3000 from 2010 to 2021.The full report can be read here: https://www.spglobal.com/esg/insights/featured/special-editorial/breaking-boundaries-women-poised-for-milestone-achievement-in-parity-amid-otherwise-bleak-outlookAbout S&amp;P GlobalS&amp;P Global (NYSE: SPGI) provides essential intelligence.

[Read more]Morgan Stanley upgraded Southern Company (SO) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $69, up from $60.

Staying at the forefront of so much change requires a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies.To enable this continuous evolution, we have made significant and long-term investment in R&amp;D - with more than 20 percent of revenues invested in R&amp;D since 2006. Our investment already exceeds more than $70B - more than 140,000 patents and patent applications, and more than 35 years of innovation in chipsets, software, services and integrated platform solutions. We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world, but primarily in Europe, China, India and the United States.Just as we make long strides in our R&amp;D efforts to drive leading contributions to technologies powering the connected intelligent edge, we make long-term investments to drive growth in countries and markets by investing in STEM talent, universities, startups and operators and by collaborating on government initiatives and with our licensees. From being a trusted knowledge advisor in spectrum selection and 5G development, deployment and commercialization, to supporting startups around the world at multiple stages of their lifecycles, to developing research collaborations designed to cultivate critical new technologies, to offering tens of thousands of hours of technical and intellectual property (IP) rights training programs, we help broader technology ecosystems flourish.Since our founding, we have prioritized supporting innovative academic research with a range of university programs helping the academic community to develop new ideas and solutions in a broad range of technological research areas at leading universities around the world. Annually, we engage with more than 100 research faculty, award more than 50 student research fellowships and sponsor more than 70 academic conferences and academia initiatives. In our engagements with academia, we share our expertise and tools across a range of technologies to facilitate research and encourage talent development.Story continuesWe also support regional innovation through incubation and mentorship programs that cultivate promising startups in vital technology areas. We offer engineering guidance, business coaching and IP programs and trainings to help startups grow and prosper into successful technology businesses. Our programs - which take zero equity in the incubated startups - have a proven record of helping startups receive venture funding, file patent applications and expand their business beyond their home countries. Our incubation challenges are complemented by other Company programs that support startups at different levels of their lifecycles - including latestage venture capital investment.These Company-supported programs have incubated or mentored more than 162 startups since 2016 in emerging markets, particularly those with an intensifying design talent pool and growing supply chain and local manufacturing expertise, such as India, Taiwan and Vietnam. The startup incubation programs in these countries were launched in 2016, 2019 and 2020, respectively.In many markets, we have a special emphasis on helping startups founded or led by women entrepreneurs. For instance, the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Qualcomm Women Entrepreneurs India Network (QWEIN) programs mentored 14 and 11 early-stage women-led startups, respectively - representing diverse sectors, including healthcare, IoT, robotics, clean technology, agricultural technology, extended reality (XR) and logistics. The 2022-2023 program will mentor an additional 11 women-led startups.Harnessing advanced cellular communication (4G and 5G) and advanced computing technologies (including AI at the network edge), these startups have developed end-to-end IoT applications for regionally relevant products and services in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, agricultural technology, smart homes, automotive, advanced computing, semiconductor design, XR, wearables, semiconductor design, robotics and drones. In many countries, we run the annual startup incubation programs in a competition style format, during which a set of top startups are initially identified through a rigorous selection process, subsequently incubated through a period of several months and finally invited to compete in a pitch and demo stage in front of a jury comprising of industry and government members, where three winners are selected. For example:In the 2021 India startup cohort, the top winners announced in March 2022 were Dhruva Space Pvt. Ltd. (a space-tech startup with its low Earth orbit satellite to enable 5G Radio Access Network), Ossus Biorenewables Pvt. Ltd. (with their innovative smart autonomous bioreactor generating green hydrogen from industrial effluents) and Nimble Vision Pvt. Ltd. (with their Ni-Smart manhole product to monitor sewage flow). Twelve additional startups are being incubated in the 2022 India program and are expected to participate in the final stage in March 2023. Separately, responding to the country's renewed focus on semiconductors, a new program for semiconductor design startups is expected to mentor up to 10 startups in 2022-2023.In the 2022 Taiwan startup cohort, the top winners announced in November 2022 were APrevent (specializing in the development of edge AI-based solutions for accurately recognizing the speech utterances of those afflicted by speech disorders such as dysarthria), Vossic (with edge AI-based fish-gender recognition technology that can be used for sustainable tilapia farming) and Moldintel (with a focus on advanced manufacturing technologies for injection molding, using edge-AI technology to help factories improve yield). Ten additional startups are being incubated in the 2023 Taiwan program, commencing in calendar Q1 2023, and are expected to participate in the final stage in Q4 2023.In the 2022 Vietnam startup cohort, the top winners announced in September 2022 were MiSmart (agriculture drone solutions), VPTech (high-end ""Make in Vietnam"" portable DAC/AMPLIFIER) and GraphnicsMiner (cardboard legged robot toy kits accompanied with an AR platform). Ten additional startups are being incubated in the 2023 Vietnam program and are expected to participate in the final stage in September 2023.In addition to providing the startups with mentorship in advanced technology through state-of-the-art laboratories with expertise and equipment for 4G/5G, robotics and AI/machine learning, Qualcomm provides them mentorship in business areas and training on the importance of securing IP rights. These startups have cumulatively filed more than 300 patent applications in regional and international patent offices to protect their own inventions.Qualcomm is an expert in training partners across the ecosystem on different aspects of mobile technology - from teaching world-leading handset original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) core concepts that underpin 5G, to explaining the technical benefits of millimeter wave technology to multinational carriers, to training startups on IP protection and filing patent applications. Qualcomm Wireless Academy, supported in part by QTL, is an industry-leading virtual education platform that shares the world-class knowledge and expertise of Qualcomm Technologies' engineers with the greater mobile ecosystem.As a champion of IP protection and holder of a worldclass patent portfolio, QTL also supports IP Rights (IPR) training programs in multiple countries.In Europe and India, Qualcomm has collaborated with regional governments and other entities to offer IP programs called ""Learn to Protect"" (L2Pro). These programs have helped more than 5,000 professionals understand the importance of IPR types such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets.In the U.S., Qualcomm and the Invent Together alliance collaborated on the creation of an online learning platform called The Inventor's Patent Academy (TIPA), which is aimed at guiding American inventors from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds through the benefits of the patent system and the process of turning their breakthroughs into patented inventions. TIPA is part of a broader effort to foster a more inclusive patenting environment. Since its launch in July 2022, this platform has registered more than 500 U.S.-based students.In 2022, we launched the Snapdragon Metaverse Fund to invest up to $100 million in innovative developers and companies building immersive experiences with AR, mixed reality and VR. It is anticipated that the fund will deploy capital through a combination of venture investments in leading XR companies by Qualcomm Ventures and a grant program by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. for developer ecosystem funding in XR experiences, such as gaming, health and wellness, media, entertainment, education and enterprise.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportQualcomm, Thursday, August 10, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773606/Future-Focused-Research-and-Development-at-Qualcomm]"

157,416f4588-aca0-33b5-b4b0-80ae8716fdee,PHM,2023-08-11,Wall Street Analysts See PulteGroup (PHM) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-pultegroup-133006575.html,1691674206,STORY,['PHM'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 25.3% over the past month to $11.65.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.

Its strong global presence is a major positive. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Medtronic is expanding its global foothold within the company’s Cardiovascular business (which contributed more than 37% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2023). Within Cardiovascular, cardiac rhythm management, one of Medtronic’s largest businesses, continued to build on the company’s category leadership.Within cardiac rhythm management, Medtronic’s pacing business has been outperforming the market, banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands in existing markets. In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for Micra AV2 and VR2, which extend the battery life by 40% to 16 and 17 years, respectively.Medtronic’s Medical Surgical Portfolio is gaining from the sales momentum following the rollout of its differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets. The company is also looking to bring Hugo to the United States. We are impressed by Medtronic’s strong prospects in Touch Surgery Enterprise, the AI-powered surgical video and analytics platform. Given the fact that less than 5% of surgical procedures globally are done robotically, Medtronic expects its surgical robotics business to become a meaningful growth driver soon.Medtronic continues to expand globally. In fiscal 2023, the company generated nearly 48% of its revenues from the rest of the world. The company is now more focused on expansion in emerging markets to address the massively unmet and untapped demand for advanced medical technologies. In the fiscal fourth quarter, non-U.S. developed markets and Western Europe grew 8%. Japan returned to growth following the COVID-19 impacts of fiscal third quarter, growing 5% year over year.

The company, in this regard, noted that the full impact of inflation on its raw material and direct labor costs would be realized over the next couple of quarters with inventory rolling off the company’s balance sheet, thus affecting gross margin. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the gross margin declined 285 basis points.With Medtronic recording a significant portion of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players too. On the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, Medtronic noted that adverse currency translation would impact fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings by approximately 6%.Over the past year, shares of Medtronic have underperformed the industry.

We have also discussed key global companies which are making strides in the neurosurgery industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Neurosurgeons. US is grappling with a severe shortage of neurosurgeons with only around 3,800 board-certified practitioners nationwide. This scarcity is expected to worsen as the population ages. Currently, there is just one practicing neurosurgeon for every 60,000 Americans, even considering trainees. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that many neurosurgeons are nearing retirement age, with 45% of all practicing neurosurgeons, including trainees, being over 55 years old. The number of available training spots has remained stagnant for over a decade, with only about 200 physicians entering neurosurgery training each year, barely enough to replace those leaving the field.The situation is further strained by the increasing demand for neurosurgery services due to rising rates of conditions such as spine, stroke, and tumor as the population ages. The field has also expanded with new techniques and treatments, like deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's, increasing the demand for specialized care. As a result, practicing neurosurgeons are in high demand and are amongst one of the highest-paid medical specialists in the world, with patients often struggling to find neurosurgeons, especially in non-urban areas. This shortage poses critical challenges for trauma and stroke care. Dr. Selcuk Gocmen is considered one of the most popular and highest-paid neurosurgeons in the world. We know how healthcare is one of the crucial industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies, but it is also true that no machine or device in the world can fulfill the grave shortages in neurosurgery. However, some companies have been at the forefront of addressing inefficiencies in the specialty through automated systems with modern equipment.Story continuesFor example, Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)’s contribution to the field of neurosurgery is profound and transformative. Their innovative technologies, such as the StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system, offer advanced visualization tools for accurate anatomical modeling and surgical planning.This system seamlessly integrates optical and Electromagnetic (EM) tracking capabilities and thus, enables precise navigation during procedures. Beyond navigation, Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)’s adherence to patient outcomes is evident in the streamlined patient registration process, automatic fiducial detection, and refinement techniques that ensure accurate registration metrics.Moreover, Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)’s integration of the Hugo RAS system brings a new dimension to neurosurgical practices. With a modular design, the Hugo RAS system assists surgeons by providing a versatile platform for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic procedures. The system's HD visualization and ergonomic design also improves surgical precision and situational awareness.On the other hand, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:IART) has been a global leader in a number of medical disciplines, particularly for solutions to orthopedic extremity surgery, neurosurgery, spine surgery, and reconstructive and general surgery.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:IART's  impact extends largely to the field of neurosurgery, where they hold an unparalleled name and position. Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:IART)’s comprehensive portfolio includes implants, devices, instruments, and systems crucial for neurosurgery, neuromonitoring, neurotrauma, and critical care applications.Additionally, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:IART) is a prominent provider of surgical instruments to hospitals, surgery centers, and alternate care facilities across the United States, including physician and dental offices and has over 3,300 dedicated employees worldwide.18 Highest Paying Countries for NeurosurgeonsStoyan Yotov/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the highest paying countries for neurosurgeons, we identified the highest paying countries for doctors and then made a list for 32 countries with the average salaries for neurosurgeons.

That includes one tourist ferry line serving the Isla Marias islands that is manned by navy personnel.But on the new Mexicana airline, you won’t have to worry about being told to “Fasten your seatbelt, and that’s an order!” The Defense Department said the airline will lease 10 Boeing 737-800 jets from the manufacturer, which will provide pilots and cabin crew.Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval originally said the contract with Boeing would be for $4 billion, but later corrected himself to say he meant 4 billion pesos, or about $235 million.He said the airline is looking at 20 potential routes between Mexico City and large and mid-size Mexican cities, some of which have limited service at present, as well as tourist resorts like Cancun.Sandoval promised ticket prices would be 18% to 20% below private competitors, but was unsure if the airline would profitable. If not, it presumably would have to operate with government subsidies.The airline has been named Mexicana after a partly state-owned carrier that went into bankruptcy in 2010 and closed.The 8,500 laid-off former employees of Mexicana are longtime supporters of the president, and his administration agreed to pay them almost $50 million for the commercial rights to the old airline's brand name and some decrepit properties. Experts have said the amount far exceeded the market value.The new airline combines López Obrador’s love of state-owned companies — he has criticized decisions by previous administrations to sell off once-extensive government companies — and his near-total reliance on the armed forces, which he views as honest and a bulwark against corruption.Story continuesA military-led company operates the new Felipe Angeles airport that the president had built as a third airport serving Mexico City and is constructing a new airport at the Caribbean coast resort of Tulum.Apart from boosting traffic at the underused Felipe Angeles airport, the army-run Mexicana apparently will provide flights to feed passengers into the president's Maya Train tourism project. The army is also building that train line, which will connect beach resorts and archaeological sites on the Yucatan Peninsula.The army, which has no experience running commercial flights, has created a subsidiary ito be in charge of Mexicana.López Obrador has suggested the new airline might also serve one of the classic roles of state-owned carriers: providing service to provincial airports on routes considered unprofitable by commercial airlines. That idea could run afoul of regulations that now prohibit airlines from running Mexican airports, or vice versa.]"

This article seeks to answer the question: is Illumina a potential value trap that investors should think twice about? We will delve into the company's valuation, business operations, financial strength, profitability, and growth to provide a comprehensive analysis. Read on to gain valuable insights.A Snapshot of Illumina IncWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out. ILMN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ILMNIllumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading provider of tools and services to analyze genetic material with applications in life science and clinical labs. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools are used for smaller data outputs such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays, which account for less than 10% of sales, for lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.Is Illumina (ILMN) a Potential Value Trap? Think Twice Before InvestingIllumina's GF ValueThe GF Value is an exclusive GuruFocus measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value calculation, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) might be a potential value trap, meaning investors should think twice before investing. At its current price of $190.3 per share, Illumina has a market cap of $30.10 billion. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesIs Illumina (ILMN) a Potential Value Trap? Think Twice Before InvestingFinancial Strength of IlluminaInvesting in companies with low financial strength can result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Illumina's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.5, which ranks worse than 68.78% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Illumina's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Illumina (ILMN) a Potential Value Trap? Think Twice Before InvestingProfitability and Growth of IlluminaInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Illumina has been profitable for 9 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $4.40 billion and a Loss Per Share of $28.53. Its operating margin is 2.38%, which ranks better than 52.44% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Illumina at 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is another crucial factor in the valuation of a company. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Illumina's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 60.4% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0%, which ranks worse than 0% of companies in the industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Illumina's ROIC was 0.89, while its WACC came in at 10.68.Why Illumina Might Be a Value TrapDespite its seeming undervaluation, Illumina might be a value trap due to several potential concerns. With a Piotroski F-score of only 3 out of a possible 9, there might be a downward trend in critical aspects such as profitability, funding, and efficiency. Investors should look beyond the appealing low valuation and ensure there are no concealed long-term risks.ConclusionOverall, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock might be a potential value trap, warranting caution before investing. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 0% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry.

With that, I will turn the call over to CEO, Drew Spaventa.Story continuesAndrew SpaventaGood afternoon, and welcome to Singular Genomics Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to provide you with an update on our company's performance. We will focus our update on the following 4 key areas: one, commercial execution; two, market opportunity; three, operational execution; and four, our innovation pipeline. As a reminder, we previously outlined these key areas during our Q1 earnings call as the 2023 four pillars of success. These pillars are the framework for how we intend to measure our progress throughout the year. Let's start with the commercial execution. The second quarter was an important time for the company, which yielded a moderated pace of additional key external placements that we expect will support our ramp of unit shipments in the second half of 2023. We continue to believe that this measured deployment of systems among influential key opinion leaders, or KOLs, and other strategically important partners is the appropriate strategy to establish our G4 platform as the foundation for our sustained success during the second half of the year and into 2024. We shipped 3 G4 systems during the quarter to academic labs, bringing our total system placements in the field as of the end of the quarter to 11. We also added to our library prep compatibility menu and grew the number of qualified leads in the sales funnel. We are excited to continue expanding our installed base and delivering the speed, power, flexibility and accuracy of the G4 system to our customers. Customer feedback continues to validate the G4's value proposition as a superior alternative to other mid-throughput sequencers. For instance, the University of Vermont noted that, ""The flexibility and consumable costs were undeniably compelling to purchase the G4, substantially better than an Illumina instrument, with excellent flexibility in flow cell loading tolerances. Output is much higher than reported in company's spec sheets."" We continue to be pleased with the G4 performance at initial customer sites. Customer feedback has validated that our G4 instrument exceeds key data specifications and is capable of addressing a broad set of applications. As you would expect at this stage, it takes time and work to get users up and running, including time for trainings, workflow and protocol optimization, and completing field services and upgrades on the instrument. Nevertheless, there is an encouraging progress throughout the quarter, which is enabling quicker customer bring-up, more seamless support and training and better system support. These important improvements will enable customers to scale quicker, run more frequently and raise pull-through. We will provide more color on utilization and pull-through now. We believe higher utilization of our G4 platform will be enabled by 2 things: usability and product availability. First, the usability of the platform. It is critical to make the G4 easy to use as possible for customers to move their work and scale their work on the platform. This includes ease of training or onboarding, ongoing operation of the system, usability feature sets such as dashboards, run tracking, system monitoring and system uptime, which is a symptom of both system reliability and field service support. We have made significant progress on each of these in the second quarter, and we'll continue to focus on these key factors for the rest of 2023, which are critical to utilization and pull-through. Second, product availability. New consumable kits offerings will be available in the second half of the year, including the F3 and Max Read flow cell kits. The F3 doubled the throughput of the F2 kit, delivering a highly competitive price per gigabase or price per read and further expand the set of applications that makes sense to run on the G4. The Max Read single cell kit delivers over 800 million reads on a single flow cell or 3.2 billion reads per run. This will deliver a unique combination of throughput, flexibility and cost for a leading application single cell sequencing in the academic and research segment. We expect these additional product offerings to drive utilization of the system and increase consumable pull-through for systems in the field over time. Turning to the market opportunity. We believe the demand for our G4 platform continues to be strong among our target customer segments, as evidenced by a growing funnel of qualified leads, additional prospective G4 evaluation sites and increased inbound interest from positive reference sites. The sales funnel continues to grow, with total qualified opportunities nearing 200. In addition, we are seeing initial traction with academic core labs, the majority of which comprise our current placements. These labs are often managing varying sample volumes and output requirements from a range of applications like RNA-Seq and single cell sequencing. The speed, power and flexibility of the G4 enables these labs to optimize sequencing runs based on varying experimental needs and delivers results in less than a day. Interest in the G4 has continued to increase from researchers and lab directors at leading academic labs. For example, MIT recently noted that, ""We have been very excited by the enthusiasm of the researchers we support for the G4, with many labs already submitting projects to be run on the sequencer. These include samples for RNA-Seq, both standard and high throughput, CUT&amp;RUN, as well as custom protocols where laboratories are preparing their own libraries."" We are encouraged by the positive traction and growing interest and expect this to translate to increased demand in unit placements over time. As expected and discussed on prior earnings calls, we shipped a moderated number of G4 systems in the first half of the year. We believe that this measured deployment of systems was the right approach for 3 reasons: first, to establish a foundation for sustained success; second, to implement system improvements aimed at reliability, usability and manufacturability; and third, to make sure customer expectations are met or exceeded. We believe unit placements will ramp in the second half of 2023, given the progress made in manufacturing and the ability to supply instruments to the field, coupled with increased commercial traction, growth in the sales funnel, and availability of F3 and then Max Read kits for single cell sequencing. Turning to operational execution. Our focus has been on optimizing the supply chain, streamlining manufacturing processes and enhancing the G4's usability and reliability. We've been executing on several key initiatives to support these goals. In operations and manufacturing, we've taken steps to strengthen our G4 production capabilities. This includes engaging second sources for suppliers of critical components, working collaboratively with vendors to refine specifications and subcomponent testing protocols, and implementing additional QC testing for incoming parts. These initiatives are designed to reduce the time required to build and bring up the G4 instrument and increase predictability in the supply chain. In addition, we rolled out several important software updates to systems in the field, providing new features and enhancements designed to improve usability and reliability. In our commercial organization, we are expanding our presence outside of the U.S. We attended the European Human Genetics Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in June, where our commercial team met with industry KOLs and scientific leaders from the region and showcased the G4 through system demos, technical talks and presentations. In addition, we are excited to have brought on board a General Manager of Europe, which we believe is an important step in our international commercial growth strategy. Turning to innovation and our product pipeline. Our team is excited about the progress being made on the pipeline of innovations, including improvements in the G4 system performance and specs, higher throughput flow cells and consumable kits and novel content and workflows for widely run applications. We're pleased to have F3 flow cells available after a successful early access period. The F3 flow cell doubled the number of reads from our F2 flow cell offering, allowing users to get up to 450 million reads per flow cells or 1.8 billion reads per run, addressing some of the most widely run applications. We have also started shipping Max Read kits for single cell sequencing to early access customers. This kit is designed to allow users to get up to 800 million reads per flow cell or 3.2 billion reads per run. This enables NovaSeq-level pricing for single cell sequencing on a benchtop system. We look forward to offering this kit for broader commercial release later this quarter. With a compelling set of kits available in the second half, our major focus will be on execution of the already announced products, ensuring quality, availability and supporting customers and moving their work on to these new offerings. Thus far, feedback from customers on F3 and early access users of Max Read has been positive. We believe this will be an important catalyst for scaling the G4 placements over the rest of the year and facilitating more system usage and higher pull-through. And finally, we continue to progress our work in multiomics. We have a lean team dedicated to the development of the PX, our high throughput, in situ spatial and single cell system. We look forward to providing additional updates in the future at the appropriate time. Now I'll turn the call over to Dalen to go through the details of our second quarter financial results.Dalen MeeterThank you, Drew. I'll start by covering the Q2 2023 financials, then I'll provide additional directional remarks on key metrics for the rest of 2023.Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was approximately $0.5 million, predominantly made up of revenue recognized on 2 instruments during the quarter. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $27.5 million compared to $24.2 million for the second quarter of 2022. These totals included noncash stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million in Q2 2023 and $3.6 million in Q2 2022. In addition, Q2 2023 included a noncash expense of $1.9 million related to a onetime adjustment in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment. The year-over-year increase in total operating expenses was otherwise driven primarily by scaling headcount, facilities and infrastructure to support commercialization of the G4 and development of our product road map.Net loss for the second quarter of 2023 was $25.6 million or $0.35 per share compared to $24 million or $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Our weighted average share count for the second quarter, used to calculate net loss per share, was approximately 72.5 million. And then cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, totaled $206.7 million.Turning to comments on the rest of 2023. Commercial interest continues to be strong as reflected in the growing number of qualified opportunities in the sales funnel. We believe that the number of placements in the second half of 2023 will ramp, supported by commercial availability of the F3 flow cell consumable kits and our Max Read kits for single cell sequencing. Consumable pull-through is still in the early stages. As Drew noted, we're seeing early commercial traction with academic customers with 9 of our 11 G4 placements at academic labs. Utilization at these academic customers is dependent on experiments and sequencing project volumes and could be slower to ramp initially depending on sequencing project needs. We anticipate learning more about customer utilization patterns over time and expect to provide updates on consumable pull-through as it becomes more predictable. Regarding operating expenses, while we do expect investment in the second half of 2023 to modestly increase in areas directly related to the G4 commercialization and development of our product road map, we intend to manage existing resources to provide cash runway into the second half of 2025.Thank you, and back to Drew for closing remarks.Andrew SpaventaThank you, Dalen. I'm proud of the team's dedication during Q2. Our hard work and efforts are establishing the critical foundation from which we can scale as a business. In the second quarter, we made significant internal progress in manufacturing, quality and operations. We also shipped 3 G4 systems, supported customer installations and upgrades, added to our order book and grew the number of qualified opportunities in the sales funnel. Our recent product launches including the F3 flow cells and consumable kits and the early access version of our Max Read kits for single cell sequencing are expected to be important catalysts driving commercial demand and scaling across the second half of the year. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to receive validation that we designed the right product with a feature set and value proposition that meets the needs of many of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the market. We remain steadfast and confident in the opportunity in front of us.Now let's open it up for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs.Matthew Carlisle SykesI just wanted to -- kind of on the back of your comments about the second half ramp, Drew. Previously -- in previous quarters, you kind of laid out sort of a cadence of 2 to 4 per month with sort of the first half of the year at the low end and maybe the end of the year being at the higher end of that. Is that still kind of a measure we should be using as you talk about this back half ramp? Or should we be thinking about a different kind of cadence as you kind of measure that demand going forward?Andrew SpaventaMatt, thanks for taking the time to listen and for the questions. We haven't communicated anything differently. That 2 to 4, we'll likely step into it. I think you can gather from the comments that we still are scaling in very much in the early stages of getting the first handful of instruments out. But that is the previously discussed range and we should be stepping into that in the second half of the year and hopefully ramping into next year.Matthew Carlisle SykesGot it. And then just maybe a little more detail on the expansion into Europe. Just given the academic presence in Europe, is that -- and your success so far with academic core labs. Is that part of the reason why you're kind of investing in that area? Or any other kind of color you can provide on that expansion would be helpful.Andrew SpaventaYes, absolutely. We've actually had quite a bit of inbound demand from Europe, a number of conferences that we've attended. It seems that the G4 will be a really good fit for that market. The European market is much more decentralized. You don't have any -- as many large central labs doing really high throughput sequencing. It's much more decentralized and fragmented. And the speed and the flexibility speaks very well to that environment.It's a modest investment at this point in Europe. Again, putting the foundation in place, getting a general manager for the area, starting to think about support and application scientists to bring up customers is really the first part of that. And we're just starting to lay that foundation now to set us up for the ability to enter that market next year. But we do think, overall, Europe will be a really compelling market and a nice fit for the profile of the G4.Matthew Carlisle SykesGot it. And just one last one, if I could sneak it in. You talked about shipping Max Read and F3 flow cell. It sounds like that just commenced. So in terms of like sort of the pulling in of demand from the instrument side with those products and sort of the positive feedback that you've gotten from the people who have trialed it so far, should we be kind of thinking about sort of like towards the end of the year type dynamic if -- as those products get shipped out over time?Andrew SpaventaYes, I think it will definitely inflect the demand. What we're seeing out there, in general, is sales cycles are longer than I think a lot of people anticipated. Then a lot of that has to do with the macro environment and the evaluation framework for which customers are putting new technology through. So the interest is really strong. It's very much a show me with F3 and Max Reads. Customers often want to run samples or they want references and other sites they can call. And we're starting to get those up and running, which we think will be really strong catalyst. But it's still going to be a longer sales cycle than I think many had anticipated. So I think your comments on Q4 into next year, absolutely, we expect to really start to see the catalysts from the new products start to have an effect on sales funnel conversion this year and even more so in the next year.OperatorYour next question is coming from John Sourbeer from UBS.Unidentified AnalystIt's actually Christian on for John. I know you guys called out about, I think, it was 200 people within the sales funnel. I was just looking for any more color. Can you talk about how that funnel has progressed throughout 2023? And I think you kind of touched on it on the previous question. The sales cycle, how has that progressed? And then if you could give any color on pricing and how that really is affecting the conversation.Andrew SpaventaYes. So maybe I'll start with kind of the sales funnel. Going back into the back half of last year, I think in our Q3 earnings call, I don't think we gave a specific number, it was probably in the dozens of qualified leads. And I think let's remember what a qualified lead is. A qualified lead is something that's passed several filters and is now an entity that has a need for a sequencer. We're speaking with the right person that has the authority to make a purchase and they have budget. And those are important factors to understand in the quality of the lead.We've seen it steadily increase. But this last quarter, we saw probably the most significant increase in the funnel, now up to close to 200 qualified leads. Now not all of those are near term, meaning they will convert right away, but they are all real opportunities, and it's very encouraging for us to really see this start to build. And we're confident that over time, we're going to start to really see a higher level of conversion. We're going to see the ramp really start to take form. So we're excited about it.And then on the -- I think second question was on kind of the sales dynamic or the pricing, is that right?Unidentified AnalystYes. Yes.Andrew SpaventaYes. So we've taken the strategy so far to try and maintain price integrity. If you look at -- it's a small end number, but if you look at our ASPs, they've been trending in the high 200,000s for the last 3 quarters over the 11 instruments. We do have a reagent rental and we have a lease model. We will do strategic placements as needed, or evaluations. But by and large, our strategy has been to try and show the value for the G4 and hold the line on price to make sure the customers are really stepping in and making a commitment and they realize the value of the platform, the speed, the flexibility, the cost point to run the system. All of that should easily justify a purchase price of the instrument that's kind of in line with an Illumina list of $335,000 and typically sells close to that. So I think it's really a matter of time to get the system established. But so far, we have, I think, been fortunate to realize ASPs that are indicative of the system value, and we will try to continue to do that.OperatorYour next question is coming from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen.Daniel Gregory BrennanGreat. Maybe just a little bit on, I guess, competitive dynamics. I know it's a large market. You guys have a couple of boxes in there kind of placed. But just what are you seeing in the labs? Does anything change in terms of when you're going up against whether it be Element or whether it be Illumina, how are things going there?Andrew SpaventaYes, I'd say that the general trend in the labs is that people are understanding that there is a choice, and I think they're doing more thorough evaluations and they're taking their time to really look at the different options and what meets their needs. At times, labs are asking to test samples. At times, they're asking for references. Overall, Illumina is the competitive alternative that we are going up against 98% of the time. And that really is the predominant player out there. Illumina, I think, will ship close to 1,200 NextSeqs this year and many more MiSeqs. And for us, those are really the opportunities on where we can offer a much more compelling value at a similar price point given the profile of the instrument. So I think the positive part of it is the value proposition, especially within the academics and the cores and kind of the private investigator labs, really resonates. It's essentially a similar price point, but you get a ton more flexibility. It's a lower cost for an experiment. Our flow cells are down to $600, and it's just a much better system for how they want to use and do their sequencing. So we feel really good about kind of how we stack up competitively. I think the big issue, Dan, is really just establishing the platform of the company as being a 0 or low-risk acquisition. And that's something that just takes time. It takes references, and we're working on that right now.Daniel Gregory BrennanGreat. And just in terms of setting the model straight for the back half of the year, I guess. I mean it sounds like you're confident you can get into that (inaudible) that Matt mentioned, the 2 to 4 per month. But is it a little bit more skewed to 4Q versus 3Q in terms of how we should be thinking about the third quarter?Andrew SpaventaYes, I think so. I mean just for the comments, we're being pretty direct and candid. The sales cycles are taking a little bit longer. Leads are growing. References are growing. Everything is trending in the right direction. The progress made internally to be able to supply instruments, we're feeling good about that. And as we look into the third and fourth quarter, absolutely kind of stepping into that range in the low end for the third quarter and then hopefully starting to raise into the middle or the higher range for Q4 and setting up for a really nice next year. That's absolutely how we're thinking about it.Daniel Gregory BrennanAnd kind of your capacity for next year would be, assuming you can get to that 6 and, call it, like 9 in Q3, Q4. Kind of how would we use that as a jumping off point what you can do next year?Andrew SpaventaLet us take this quarter and really understand a little bit better kind of how this and next quarter are looking. I think we do want to be more forthcoming with how we think about next year could look in terms of kind of goalpost on unit placements and revenue. But I just don't think we know enough yet to be able to give you an accurate answer there. So give us a little time, but we'll certainly be planning to give more information about how '24 is shaping up in coming calls.Dalen MeeterDan, maybe just one comment to add to that. It's Dalen. In prior calls, we have talked about the dedicated manufacturing space that we have. That has plenty of infrastructure capacity to get us through the next couple of years in terms of supply with G4. It's just a matter of the labor and some of the other kind of ancillary variable cost and investment items to support the unit. So we've got the infrastructure. It's just how quickly we want to scale it up.OperatorYour next question is coming from Mike Ryskin from Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Avantika] on for Mike. I wanted to ask you, where do you see the gross margins moving to in the second half and maybe in 2024 as the consumer loads ramp up?Dalen MeeterYes. This is Dalen. The gross margin, we expect the model to be similar in line with other tools companies. If you think about kind of the traditional razor-razorblade model, instruments get placed at a lower gross margin profile. And then as the pull-through increases, the consumables really start to take over the mix of revenue at a much higher gross margin profile. And so as that mix changes, you get a nice gross margin tailwind. And we would expect, we're in such small end counts right now in terms of the installed base. Pull-through is still in the very early stages. As we move into next year, we would expect to see kind of that traditional tailwind of the model as we're able to move customers up the utilization curve and grow the installed base.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And then given your comments on the cost control, how much of a priority is the PX currently?Andrew SpaventaYes, it's a good question. The PX remains, and our spatial effort, in general, remains something that we're committed to. We believe using the sequencing technology that we have and applying it to cells and tissue is really novel and something unique that we can offer. And we've had quite an abundance of feedback through KOLs and interactions that really verify and validate that. We are moving forward with the TAP program right now. It's the Technology Access Program, with 2 leading academics, where we're working with them to receive samples and show novel methods with the technology was developed to go into 2 sequencing and look at kind of spatial context in tissue and cells, and it's something we plan to share more about later year and into next year.As far as the PX system itself relates, it will take a broader effort to bring forward, and we've talked previously about looking and exploring partnerships or alternative ways that we can fund that program. So the work is continuing. It's a small and lean team. We're being judicious with our capital spend. But at this point, we do believe it's the right place to have a modest investment, given the high value of the opportunity.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And then if I can sneak one more in. I know this quarter, you had 3 shipments to academic. Are you surprised with the heavy biased towards academic customers and like, the reason why you're not seeing customers -- commercial customers buying more?Andrew SpaventaNo, not really. I think when we look at the kind of the adoption profile of different market segments, your academics are typically going to be the early adopters. And that really rings true for a lot of different new technologies that sell into this type of environment. They're going to kick the tires. They're going to provide feedback. They're going to work with you. They're usually on the kind of the cutting tip of new technologies. Once the academics adopt and you start to get publications and you kind of have that foundation, the next segment that we would expect, and we do have these represented in our funnel, would be kind of your private companies, your large research -- or your large and medium-sized research companies, people that are essentially using sequencing as an internal tool to develop whatever product they're doing. There's a ton of sequencing being done for cell therapy, for CRISPR applications. So that would kind of be the next wave of customers. And then kind of beyond that would be kind of hospital medical centers, academic medical centers or larger clinical customers that are running sequencing fleets to run clinical testing or LDT. So there's really a continuum of buyers, but it really depends on kind of where you are in the life cycle of your system launch. And I'll just give you one example. If you're thinking about the application of a newborn intensive care unit sequencing, that's not an application that you're going to offer with a new technology that you're still kind of ironing out the kinks that's new to market. That's something you're going to go into looking at a very mature box, and that's something that we very much think is a good application for the G4 given the seamless flexibility. But it's also something that you go to at the point in time when you have a really stable, established platform and you're a bit down the road. So a long-winded way of saying not surprised at all with the early academic interest. Our funnel right now is probably about 2/3 academic, but there's a good third of entities in the funnel that are the other profiles as well that I think will be adopters of the technology.OperatorThat completes our Q&amp;A session. Everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.]"

GRAIL revenues are anticipated to be between $90 and $110 million (unchanged from the outlook provided in the last reported earnings update).Key AnnouncementsThroughout the second quarter, Illumina headlined on many occasions. During the quarter, the company launched DRAGEN 4.2, which expands upon award-winning accuracy combined with renowned flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data.ILMN entered into a strategic partnership with Pillar Biosciences to make Pillar's suite of oncology assays commercially available globally as part of the Illumina portfolio of oncology products.The company also unveiled PrimateAI-3D, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that predicts with unprecedented accuracy disease-causing genetic mutations in patients.Within GRAIL, the company announced results from the prospective SYMPLIFY study, showing strong performance of Galleri in the symptomatic population of more than 6,000 patients and demonstrated the feasibility of using a Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) test to assist clinicians with decisions regarding referral from primary care.Our TakeIllumina delivered better-than-expected seccond-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues. During the quarter, the company shipped 109 NovaSeq X instruments, boosting its supply capacity to more than 390 instruments for fiscal year 2023.  Mid-teens growth in clinical led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing. During the quarter, the company launched DRAGEN 4.2 instruments. ILMN also unveiled PrimateAI-3D, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that predicts with unprecedented accuracy disease-causing genetic mutations in patients.The year-over-year performance remained sluggish. An expected Covid-19 surveillance headwind adversely affected Core Illumina’s revenues, including sequencing consumables revenues.On the flip side, contraction in both margins raises apprehension.

Novo Nordisk is lifting its full-year outlook in accordance with the overwhelming success of its weight-loss and diabetes drugs while reducing their supply of lower doses.Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down Novo Nordisk's earnings, also turning her attention to biotech company Illumina's (ILMN) slashed annual profits and the latest COVID-19 variant, ""Eris"", which the World Health Organization is calling a ""variant of interest.""Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Novo Nordisk reported second quarter earnings, lifting sales guidance for the year on its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. Yahoo Finance Anjalee Khemlani has the details us. But there is a fly in the ointment. They're sort of a victim of these drugs success.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yes, they are. And as you noticed, they miss on Wall Street expectations in part as a result of having to curb their output of these drugs. But let's break it all down. You saw the numbers for the earnings. Let's get into those obesity drug sales.While they did bring in $1.57 billion for the quarter, they have already had to curb their output, especially of lower dose products in particular Wegovy. So while they did say sales were up 30%, they did show increased operational revenue. They are predicting and upgrading their guidance for the year between 27 to 33% for sales and 31 to 37% for operational growth.They are also looking at still maintaining some sort of restriction especially in the US. But there were some surprising numbers there. If you want to take a look at what the US market looked like, it did have about-- account for 44% of all GLP1 products. Now GLP1, let's just recap what that is. That is all of their obesity and diabetes products. So that includes Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus. Those are the ones that they have out there on the market right now for both. And they are not a new class of drugs, but the new formula of these drugs that are really driving these blockbuster categories.Story continuesSo GLP1 sales in the US 44% increase and internationally 62%. And that is still with a restricted market. So kind of interesting considering what the expectation is, what the demand is. You heard repeatedly on the call this morning that company officials are looking at increasing manufacturing output. They've already had to add an additional line from what was expected. So they'll have a total of three manufacturing plants for these products alone. And that's where the demand is coming from.Ozempic already giving them a record year last year. And then now Wegovy, especially with their new results for the cardiovascular benefit, really boosting sales and expected to boost sales for the year. So all things considered, still a slow ramp up on that Wegovy product. Internationally, it's not available as widely as here in the US. They're also reducing the amount of lower dose product that's available as a result of the demand to ensure that once patients are on the product, they can actually titrate up to those higher dose levels.So a lot going on for the company. Mixed results. On the downside, 18% reduction in their rare disease segment of business. So that sort of balanced out and help contribute to those lower than expected results. They have had some manufacturing and production issues just as for the weight loss products. So that's sort of the mixed bag picture that you see for this company right now.BRAD SMITH: And Anjalee, we could leave it there. But in the words of the late great Billy Mays, but wait, there's more. You're also watching shares of Illumina. Despite topping the Street's estimates, the company cut its sales and profit outlook for the year. Tell us what we need to know there.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, Illumina is one of those stories. I mean, you know, for swinging away from the opposite end of the spectrum, Illumina has had a lot of trouble this year. We know of course, the fight with Carl Icahn of course, has been weighing on the company, that Grail acquisition for $8 billion from 2021 and the sort of spinning out of that once again or the need to as a result of both US and EU regulators really talking about the concern there with acquiring it before it was approved for, $170 million fine. CEO Left in June. A 10% cut in their research and development segment in July.A lot of stuff moving to the downside. They also expect lower than expected sales of their latest sequencer. They've also been impacted by the waning COVID demand. If you looked at their numbers, 6 million in their revenue from COVID sequencing compared to $27 million in the quarter in 2022. So huge decline for them. So they're under a lot of pressure there. Even with the Grail acquisition, they have not changed the outlook for that. 90 to 100 million of income there for the year.So a lot of negatives for that company as it goes through sort of a reorganization. They also announced two more executives leaving in the last quarter. So again, a lot of pressure on this company on this saga that has had a tumultuous year to put it mildly. And then they're not expecting any massive annual growth sticking to 1% increase for the year. And that's a drop from the about 10% they had predicted at the beginning of the year. So like I said, pretty negative news there.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, indeed. And it's been a fascinating story to track. There is one more thing that you are tracking that we want to touch on, and that is the new COVID 19 variant that has been increasing in velocity. It's being called informally Eris. What do we need to know about this latest variant?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Maybe too harsh a name for the trouble it's causing right now. Not the goddess of discord and strife just yet. It is-- it accounts for about 17% of cases that are being sequenced here in the US. Of course, that is with the decreased sequencing that we do have. We have seen increased cases based on wastewater surveillance here and in the UK. That's really where the major concern is. But it's mostly just a variant to watch out for right now. That's where the World Health Organization declared that. Something to watch essentially.No major shift in symptoms, or any other concerns right now. But of course this just goes back to It's not over yet. This is also-- sorry, I meant to point out-- this is also a variant of the Omicron family. So that also is continuing what we know as the dominant strains if you will right now.JULIE HYMAN: Woo, all right. Good to know all of this. Thanks for covering all of this for us. Really appreciate it, Anjalee.]"

Both its top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year.Delving DeeperThe company reported a net loss of 18 cents per share, which was 63.6% wider than the consensus estimate of a loss of 11 cents per share. In the year-ago period, it generated a loss of 9 cents.Net sales totaled $17.6 million, which lagged the consensus mark of $22 million by 21.3%. The reported figure decreased by 1.7% from $17.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The downside was due to the variability in the timing of certain LED lighting projects.Orion Energy Systems, Inc.

Quote Several larger projects that have commenced in the early fiscal second quarter include a Department of Defense project in Europe and an outdoor lighting project for Orion’s largest customer.Segment DetailsLighting Division revenues were $12.6 million, down from $13.9 million a year ago. Several larger projects for national customers are now ramping up in second-quarter fiscal 2024. Decreases in LED Lighting and maintenance services were offset by contributions from the Voltrek EV charging acquisition (completed in third-quarter fiscal 2023).Maintenance Division revenues came in at $3.8 million in the reported quarter, down from $4.1 million in the previous year. Management is focused on offsetting inflation pressures through pricing actions and increasing the percentage of self-performing work to improve margin performance.Electric Vehicle Charging revenues were $1.2 million in the first quarter. The business is focused on integration and personnel recruitment processes designed to position it for accelerating growth on a national basis.Operating HighlightsGross margin contracted 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 18%. Products’ gross margin increased to 26.4% from 23% based on product sales mix and improved absorption of fixed costs. However, the services margin declined to (11.2%) from 10.3% in the prior-year period. This was due to legacy maintenance services contracts from the Stay-Lite Lighting acquisition, some of which are multi-year contracts and have pricing that is insufficient to absorb the cost.Operating expenses increased by 45.5% from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to acquisition-related costs and increased G&amp;A expenses.Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was negative of $4.4 million compared with negative of $2.9 million a year ago.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.25 million compared with $16 million at the end of fiscal 2023. In first-quarter fiscal 2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled $7.3 million compared with $5 million in the previous year.Fiscal 2024 OutlookThe company expects revenues of approximately $100 million, reflecting growth of 30% or more compared with fiscal 2023. A greater proportion of revenues is likely to be generated in the second half of fiscal 2024. Of this projection, $34 million is likely to be generated by maintenance services and EV charging solutions and $64 million from LED lighting products and solutions, including national account projects, ESCO partners and distribution channel sales.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent ReleasesOESX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company not only reported lower revenues, it also reported a loss in the second quarter compared with the year-ago figure. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of earnings and revenues miss. Lower revenues, manufacturing unit expenses, temporary production inefficiencies, elevated input costs and higher impairment and restructuring expenses led to weak performance.Earnings &amp; Revenue DiscussionIn the quarter under review, the company reported loss per share of 69 cents missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of 20 cents.In the second quarter, total revenues of $143.7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160 million. The top line decreased from $180.3 million a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, second-quarter revenues were down 18.4% year over year. The downside was due to lower volume, given global economic headwinds, mainly in renovation and remodeling channels, across the company’s main regions and the competitive landscape.Caesarstone’s adjusted gross margin declined to 9.6% in the second quarter from 26.4% a year ago. The negative aspect stemmed from reduced revenues and escalated manufacturing unit expenses resulting from diminished absorption of fixed costs, primarily linked to decreased capacity utilization and the shutdown of the Sdot-Yam facility. Additionally, temporary production inefficiencies, an adjustment in inventory valuation, and elevated input costs for sold products contributed to the downside.Operating expenses in the quarter were 40.9% of revenues, higher than 22.8% in the prior-year quarter due to higher impairment and restructuring expenses.Owing to the above-mentioned headwinds, the company incurred an operating loss of $46.9 million in the quarter against operating earnings of $6.4 million a year ago.Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $13.4 million in the second quarter against adjusted EBITDA of $17.1 million a year ago.Story continuesCaesarstone Ltd.

(NASDAQ:NEWT) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 65% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 23%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for NewtekOne While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Looking back five years, both NewtekOne's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 14% per year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 5% compound annual share price fall. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NewtekOne, it has a TSR of 30% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveNewtekOne shareholders are down 7.5% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 5.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NewtekOne better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with NewtekOne (including 3 which can't be ignored) .If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

And that's left many wondering what to do with vacant commerical properties — and whether time's up for investors in the space.But for keen investors willing to put in some cash and hard work, there are still plenty of opportunities in real estate. Just look at the trio from Pennsylvania who took on the ambitious project of converting an abandoned school building into an apartment complex.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepareJesse Wig, Adam Colucci and Dan Spanovich found an off-market deal to purchase Bowtie High, an abandoned high school, for $100,000 in 2019. Spanovich, a 42-year-old developer, helped his co-investors convert the dilapidated property into a massive apartment complex.A hefty $3.3 million later, the site is a 31-unit apartment complex.One-bed and two-bed units start at $1,400 and $1,600, respectively, and the property is already at 100% occupancy.The project was so successful, the trio have already reinvested some of the profits into another abandoned school nearby, intending to convert it into another apartment complex with 33 units.The Bowtie High experiment highlights some key trends of the U.S. housing market that investors need to know before making their next real-estate move.Housing supply shortageAccording to multiple media reports, there are simply not enough homes being built to keep pace with the U.S. population.Between 2012 and 2022, the number of single-family housing starts trailed the number of household formations by 6.5 million units, according to Realtor.com.Story continuesAnd that shortage also applies to the existing home inventory. Recently, Realtor.com reported a ""bleak lack of inventory"" for prospective homebuyers earlier this month with the number of new listings down 7.1% compared to a year before and overall inventory of both new and old listings down by 5.1%.This housing shortage is expected to persist in the years ahead. This is why the conversion of commercial properties such as schools and offices into residential units is highly attractive.Passive incomeGiven that Bowtie High has 31 units occupied at between $1,400 and $1,600 a month, the property generates more than $500,000 in annual rent. That implies a gross return of around 15% on the trio’s total investment of more than $3 million. That’s an incredible return, but it took months of sweat and tears to get there.Fortunately, investors can generate passive income from real estate using online platforms and avoid the hassle of real estate development and renovation.Residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Camden Property Trust (NYSE:CPT) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:MAA) offer dividend yields of 3.7% to 3.8%.That’s not as lucrative as the Bowtie High project but involves significantly less work and risk. For the average investor looking to put money to work and generate a steady passive income, REITs are certainly attractive for almost any investor.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howTax incentivesWig, Colucci and Spanovich qualified for tax credits because they were renovating a historic building that had been abandoned for over 10 years. Both the state of Pennsylvania and the federal government offer various incentives for these types of projects.The team decided to double-down on this strategy by reusing some of the old doors, hardwood and bookshelves from the former school to furnish their new apartment complex. Reclaimed vintage furniture adds more character to the building.Historic restoration isn’t the only way to secure tax credits for real estate investments.

This will take the annual payment to 2.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Skyworks Solutions' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, Skyworks Solutions' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 51.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendSkyworks Solutions Is Still Building Its Track RecordSkyworks Solutions' dividend has been pretty stable for a little while now, but we will continue to be cautious until it has been demonstrated for a few more years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.44 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 22% a year over that time. We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Skyworks Solutions has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.4% per annum. Skyworks Solutions definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Our Thoughts On Skyworks Solutions' DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payout ratios are a good sign, we are less enthusiastic about the company's dividend record. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

The programs have grown in popularity since the 2020 death of George Floyd prompted the industry to rethink whether it can improve its services to underserved communities.""Homeownership is central to building wealth but has been out of reach for many minority families as a result of systemic inequalities in housing and finance,"" said Kevin Reen, head of Wells Fargo Home Lending, adding that down payments are among ""the biggest barriers to achieving homeownership.""The Wells Fargo homebuyer grants will start in eight metro areas: Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas, Washington, Baltimore, Atlanta, Charlotte and New York.Buyers who live or are buying a home in those markets can qualify for the grants if their income is 120% or less of the median income of the county the home is in. Recipients can use the funds only on down payments for a conventional fixed-rate mortgage from Wells Fargo.They can also combine them with other programs to get more assistance, including Wells Fargo programs that help buyers pay for closing costs on their purchase.The San Francisco lender is conducting the effort under its special-purpose credit program, a type of initiative regulators have encouraged to help expand credit to disadvantaged groups.The programs are allowed under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, though many lenders had long feared they'd be charged with favoring one group of people over another. But regulators have recently assured bankers that they can launch those programs without triggering concerns. In 2021, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the programs generally don't conflict with the Fair Housing Act. A broader group of bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, sent a similar message to banks last year.Story continuesThe programs are ""one method to address discrimination and bias in mortgage credit transactions,"" Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr said in a speech last month.Wells Fargo and other banks have launched programs in recent months as the regulatory environment became more clear.JPMorgan Chase said last year a pilot program for small businesses in majority-minority neighborhoods would soon be offered nationally. Citigroup and Bank of America have also launched programs to help boost minority homeownership.Additionally, regional banks such as U.S. Bancorp in Minneapolis and Cleveland-based KeyBank have started programs of their own.Wells Fargo has an existing special-purpose credit program initiative that has helped eligible Black homeowners refinance their homes at low interest rates.The program, which started last year, is aimed at homeowners who didn't take advantage of ultralow mortgage rates earlier in the pandemic. Wells Fargo subsidizes the rate differential since rates are higher now, along with one-time expenses such as closing costs. More than 3,200 customers have used the program, the bank said.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$46.27 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$43.72. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, Wells Fargo insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

I would like to turn the call over to Ugur Sahin.Ugur Sahin: Thank you, Victoria. A warm welcome to all the call participants. We appreciate your continued support. Today, I will summarize our second quarter 2023 highlights and priorities before I pass the call over to my team to provide some further details. Slide 5. Let me start reiterating our 2023 strategic priorities that we set at the beginning of the year and highlight our recent progress executing against that. We pursue our priority to expand and sustain our COVID-19 leadership with Pfizer by advancing our next-generation and combination vaccine candidates and by advancing key commonality features. During this quarter, we received recommendations from regulatory authorities and the World Health Organization on the composition of the adapted COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023-2024 fall season.Story continuesBased on these recommendations, we together with our partner Pfizer has submitted regulatory packages for Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies. We have also kicked off commercial launch activities for the Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Our second 2023 strategic priority is to accelerate our oncology pipeline and initiate multiple trials with registrational potential. Our new collaborations with DualityBio and OncoC4 complement our pipeline with multiple mid to late stage clinical programs that will help us to achieve this goal in the near term. In the second quarter at ASCO Annual Meeting, we and our respective collaboration partners presented three new clinical datasets that Ozlem will cover later.Further, jointly with our partner OncoC4, we began a pivotal Phase III trial evaluating the next-generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody candidate BNT316 gotistobart as a second-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Our third strategic goal is to initiate and accelerate clinical programs with high medical need in infectious diseases. We are expecting multiple data readouts for our mRNA-based vaccine candidate in the second half of this year. In summary, we continued our focus execution against strategic priorities in the second quarter and look forward to additional progress in all three of these areas in the remainder of this year. Slide 6. Starting with COVID-19, while variants of concern has emerged in all seasons in the past few years, we expect that in the fall and winter in line with other common respiratory diseases such as influenza and RSV, also that cost two of our stabilization (ph) will increase.Slide 7. In 2023, four years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is the highest level prevalence in the global population as a result of vaccinations and/or infection. Profiles of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are highly heterogeneous as individuals have been infected with different variants and/or vaccinated using a variety of vaccine platform. The substantial genetic and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike proteins continues with divergence of the evolution of trajectory from the original wildtype virus. Despite increasing gaps in the genomic surveillance globally, the available sequencing data indicates that the original drivers and other early variants such as alpha, beta, gamma, delta are no longer detected in humans.As of July 2023, the XBB.1 descendant lineages predominate globally, and they have further antigenic distance from previous variants. Clinical data have shown that currently approved COVID-19 vaccines provide a level of protection against this new variant. However, with the antigenic drift of current variance of concern, signs of waning protections have been observed starting two to four months after booster with last season before the five adapted vaccine, including against severe COVID-19. Due to the data antigenic distance of this variance of concern and the further immune escape, absolute vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization due to COVID-19 is reduced as time passes between vaccination and subsequent infection. In summary, this data support a rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine adapted to the most recent variance of concerns this fall.We plan to launch an Omicon XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 in vaccine this fall, subject to approval by regulatory authorities. Our goal is to maintain protection against severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization and death by providing a vaccine that is better matched to the currently circulating strength and that is designed to be more closely aligned to the newer evolving lineages. Slide 8. Let me remind you of the core principles of our overarching strategy. We pursue a multi-technology driven approach rooted in deep fundamental understanding of biology and immunobiology. We leverage the power of computational science and AI. Our acquisition of InstaDeep has expanded our capabilities in that regard. Together, we aim to become the global leader in applying cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technology and research to discover, design and develop next-generation immunotherapies at scale.We build novel platforms with the abilities to use multiple product candidates for our clinical pipeline including [indiscernible] that enable and accelerate individualization of treatment. To leverage synergistic mode of actions, we explore opportunities for combining modalities, both developed internally and access via collaboration partnerships. Last quarter, we announced that we initiated a collaboration with Duality Biologics to access two of their next-generation antibody drug conjugates. This quarter, we and Duality shared clinical data from one of these programs and expanded our collaboration to a third encouraging program from Duality Biologics pipeline. Slide 9. A disease consists of three main components: antibody, linker, payload.Each of these components has an impact on ADC's pharmacological and clinical properties. It is a precision medicine, allowing for targeted drug delivery, particularly to tumor cells with high specificity and potently induce cell death with the benefit of reduced off-target events. And the monoclonal antibody binds to the target expressed on the tumor cell. The ADC is internalized allowing for the release of the cytotoxins which leads to cell death. We continue to broaden our access to ADCs because we believe this technology has the potential to replace highly toxic chemotherapy regimens to become a new combination backbone for cancer immunotherapy. Advancements in this technology have resulted in its extended use for the treatment of solid tumors.ADCs can also synergize with various immunotherapy modalities including those in our current immunotherapy pipeline. Our growing ADC pipeline now includes ADCs directed against three distinct targets and is of interest for a broad range of cancer types. In the future, we plan to combine these ADCs with our appropriate pipeline programs to maximize the patient impact of this exciting modality. With that, I would like to thank you all for your confidence in our success and your continued support. I will now turn the call over to Ozlem.Ozlem Tureci: Thank you, Ugur. I'm delighted to speak with everyone today and to provide our pipeline update. Slide 11. Starting with our COVID-19 vaccine. We expect that as Sars-Cov-2 continues to evolve and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death continues, there will be persisting demand for vaccine boosting and vaccinations, especially for at-risk and immunocompromised groups. So Omicron XBB sub-lineages currently account for the majority of COVID-19 case globally and are energetically distant from prior circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including Omicron BA 4, 5, and the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Although, Omicron BA 4, 5 adapted bivalent vaccines provide some protection against a range of outcomes from XBB related COVID-19.Evidence suggests that vaccine better matched to currently circulating sub-lineages can have further improved protection against symptomatic disease and severe COVID-19. XBB lineage viruses have reduced neutralization in comparison to earlier Omicron lineages but have similar neutralization profiles to each other. Despite sequence of XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 differ in only two mutations highlighted here. In May, the EMA and other health authorities provided guidance highlighting that updated vaccines targeting Omicron XBB.1 sub-lineages may help to maintain protection against COVID-19 during the upcoming fall and winter season, when COVID-19 case rates and hospitalizations are expected to increase. Also the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biologicals Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, issued guidance recommending manufacture of an Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for the 2023 and 2024 fall and winter seasons.We and Pfizer submitted regulatory applications to EMT and to the FDA for our Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine for individuals six months of age and order. Following guidance from regulatory authorities on the requirements for strain changes, the applications include data suggesting that Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine may generate improved responses against circulating XBB sub-lineages compared to the current Omicron BA.4-5 adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Moving to Slide 12, we and our partner Pfizer tested potential effectiveness of an Omicron XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent vaccine as a primary series and booster in mice. Here you see the neutralizing antibody response in mice immunized with our Omicron BA.4-5 adapted bivalent vaccine as booster after two doses of the original vaccine.One group of mice again received BA.4-5 adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a fourth dose. And the other group received the new XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine as a fourth dose. You can see a four to five-fold increase of neutralization of several XBB related variants when dose four is XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent vaccine as compared to last season's bivalent vaccine, indicating that the XBB.1.5 variant adapted monovalent vaccine in the pre-vaccinated setting has the potential to induce broad cross-neutralizing antibody titers against multiple XBB sub-lineages. We made significant progress towards monovalent COVID-19 vaccine against Omicron XBB.1.5, with regulatory submissions to the US-FDA, EMA, and other regulatory authorities and we are well-prepared to launch an adapted COVID-19 vaccine if approved in early fall this year.Moving to our oncology pipeline. Let me put our second quarter pipeline advancements into the broader context of our clinical stage pipeline, which is depicted on Slide 13. In the second quarter, the initiation of our pivotal Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer marks the first landmark in our strategic collaboration with OncoC4. The randomized Phase 3 trial is evaluating BNT316 the pH sensitive, anti-CTLA4 antibody with distinctive mode of action and is expected to enroll approximately 600 patients with metastatic immunotherapy resistant non-small cell lung cancer. The trial initiation follows for FDA Fast-Track designation granted in 2022 and is based on Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy data for the monotherapy in metastatic immune checkpoint inhibitor, resistant non-small cell lung cancer.Further, we expanded our collaboration with Duality and added a third ADC to our oncology pipeline. DB-1305 is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for solid tumors. Then I have news from BNT116, our lung cancer antigen based FixVac candidate. The second trial with BNT116 has dosed its first patient end of July. Together with our partner Regeneron, we will evaluate BNT116 in combination with cemiplimab for the cemiplimab monotherapy alone in treatment naive patients with stage 3b, stage 3c, or stage 4 squamous on non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients with at least 50% PD-L1 expression in a randomized multi-center open-label Phase-2 study. The Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing with BNT116 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of BNT116 alone and in combination with cemiplimab in patients who have progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor treatment or are not eligible for chemotherapy and in combination with docetaxel in patients who have received prior PD-1 inhibitor therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy.We are planning to start several trials with our partners, imminently. Firstly, building on compelling Phase 1 data in patients with resectable PDAC in the adjuvant setting that we recently reported in Nature. The Phase 2 trial with autogene cevumeran, BNT122, our individualized cancer vaccine candidate is planned with our partner Genentech, evaluating the efficacy and safety of autogene cevumeran in combination with atezolizumab and modified FOLFIRINOX compared to modified FOLFIRINOX as standard of care alone. Second, another trial is planned to start with our second ADC developed by Duality Bio. BNT324 is a humanized antibody conjugated to a novel DNA topoisomerase-1 inhibitor via a cleavable linker. The Phase 1 part of the study will evaluate the safety in all comers and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose.In the Phase 2 dose expansion part, we aim to evaluate safety and efficacy in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. On the next couple of slides, I want to summarize the recently presented data from three of our programs at the ASCO Annual Meeting. On Slide 14, starting with BNT316/ONC-392 antibody targeting of CTLA4 works primarily by depleting regulatory T-cells and thus their suppression of tumor-specific immunity. Physiologically, CTLA4 recycles continuously between the cell surface and the endosomes. Interruption of this process by a binding antibody is associated with the development of autoimmunity. Autoimmunity and immune-related adverse events are a major limitation of approved anti-CTLA4 antibodies that disrupt CTLA4 recycling by promoting lysosomal degradation of this important immune checkpoint molecule.BNT316 in contrast dissociates from the CTLA4 molecule in the endosomes allows normal recycling of both the antibody and the CTLA4 molecule and thus is designed for stronger cancer therapeutic effect and less immune-related adverse effects. Preliminary data showed that BNT316 is well-tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities. The single agent recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be 10mg/kg without MTD being reached. Severe immune-related grade 3 adverse event rate in the combo dose escalation with pembrolizumab was 23%, which is considered lower than what was reported for comparable IO-IO combinations. The recommended Phase 2 dose for combination is 6mg/kg. Overall, BNT316 dosed as monotherapy and in combination was well-tolerated and the safety profile appears to allow higher dosing for a longer duration of treatment as compared, for example, to ipilimumab.Early efficacy data is monotherapy and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients and in combination with pembrolizumab in multiple solid tumors were promising. Slide 15, with our colleagues from OncoC4, we presented data from the Phase 1/2 study investigating BNT316 in 35 non-small cell lung cancer patients with metastatic lesion that progressed on immune checkpoint inhibition in previous slides. The majority of patients had an ECOG status of 1. The objective response rate was about 30% and disease control rate was 70%. Patients that responded to BNT316 had previously failed multiple lines of treatment, including several immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this cohort, BNT316 has shown managable safety and tolerability when dosed at 10mg/kg twice and followed with 6 mg/kg every three weeks.Immune related adverse events of Grade 3, 4 were observed in 34% of patients and included immune mediated colitis, ALT/AST increase, and immune hepatitis. Our findings support the further development of BNT316 in non-small cell lung cancer in the Phase 3 study PRESERVE 003. Slide 16, our second presentation at ASCO was together with our colleagues from Duality Bio and about our first clinical data for our BNT323, our next generation HER2 targeting ADC. BNT323 is comprised of HER2-targeting antibody covalently linked to the proprietary DNA topoisomerase-1 inhibitor via a cleavable linker. Approved ADCs have shown anti-tumor activity and clinical benefits in multiple types of cancer and we believe that mid-term ADCs as a modality will become a broadly used backbone for combos in oncology.More efficacious and safer anti HER2 ADCs, for example, regarding potential lung toxicity may add further clinical benefit. Preclinical data for BNT323 distracted significantly improved therapeutic window as compared to DS-8201A or T-DM1 analogs to approved HER2 ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansine, respectively. BNT323 has a high drug-to-antibody ratio. And when incubated with rat, monkey, and human plasma demonstrated outstanding plasma stability. In HER2 positive and HER2 negative mixed cell cultures, BNT323 inhibited the proliferation of both cell types, demonstrating its bystander effect. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of BNT323 in xenografted mouse models showed targeted delivery of the toxin into tumor tissue.In vivo studies in monkeys showed a superior stability of BNT323 and rapid systemic clearance of the toxin. Altogether, these properties result in maintenance of efficacy and reduction of systemic toxicity in animal models. Slide 17, the program has received Fast-Track designation from the FDA and is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The study is enrolling pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 targetable solid tumors. HER2 status is identified via IHC or ISH for expression level via NGS for HER2 amplification or HER2 mutation. The majority of patients had a HER2 expression by IHC of 2+ or 3+. We showed preliminary anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated HER2 expressing patients with a median of seven prior systemic treatments, including other anti HER2 ADCs, anti-HER2 antibody therapy, and anti-HER2 TKI therapy.Laboratory, Health, SciencePhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashIn HER2 positive breast cancer patients, the objective response rate is 50%, the disease control rate is 96%. In HER2 low breast cancer patients, objective response rate is 38%, the disease control rate is 84%. Anti-tumor activity of BNT323 was also observed in non-breast cancer tumor types such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Responses were observed in-patients treated with different dose levels and HER2 expression status. BNT323 was well-tolerated and all adverse events were manageable so far. Interstitial lung disease of Grade 1 occurred in two patients out of 85 patients. Expansion cohorts are ongoing in selected tumor patients treated at recombinant Phase 2 dose and we expect further data this year. Slide 18, finally, we presented data on our cell therapy product candidate BNT211.We developed a highly sensitive second generation CAR targeting CLDN6 with high specificity. The carcino-embryonic antigen CLDN6 is an ideal target for [indiscernible] as it is absent in healthy tissues, but highly expressed in many high medical need cancers. To improve CAR-T cell engraftment and persistence, we co-developed a CAR-T cell amplifying RNA vaccine of CARVac for short. The goal is to keep CAR-T cells at [indiscernible] particularly relevant. In animal studies, we have shown that the persistence and effector function of CAR-T cells can be further enhanced by repeated administration of CARVac, a nano-particulate RNA vaccine that encodes Claudin-6. CARVac is based on our uridine, nucleoside mRNA lipoplex vaccine technology and mediates body-wide RNA delivery to lymphoid compartments resident antigen presenting cells.In multiple preclinical models, the display of the translated natively folded CAR target protein on antigen presenting cells mediated in-vivo stimulation and controlled expansion of CAR-Ts cells, induced the memory T-cell phenotype, along with higher target sensitivity, and enabled tumor control even if sub-therapeutic CAR-T cell doses were administered. We are testing the safety, tolerability, and activity of the combination of Claudin-6 CAR-T cells and CARVac in a bifurcated dose escalation study with increasing dose levels of CAR-T cells and the fixed CARVac schedule in patients with various cancer types that occurred in six positive defined as more than 50% of tumor cells with 2+ to 3+ intensity. Dose escalation has been completed for CAR-T cells derived from a manual manufacturing process.And we have presented data with highly encouraging signs of clinical activity and manageable safety at various conferences in the past. Slide 19, a subsequent cohort of 19 patients have been treated with our CAR-T product manufactured with a scalable automated version of the process. No DLTs have been observed so far in Claudin-6 CAR-T cells as well as CARVac were well-tolerated, reflecting the safety profile detected in the first dose escalation levels. Objective response rate was 41% for our 17 available patients and 75% for eight patients treated at dose level two, namely 1 times 10 to the 8 CAR-T cells. Next to germ cell tumors, which dominated the first-dose escalation, we observed ovarian cancer patients responding. We are expecting an additional data read-out later this year.Once we have determined the recommended Phase 2 dose for BNT211, we plan to initiate a pivotal trial in germ cell tumors, which has already received Prime Designation by the EMA. Advancing our pipeline remains a key strategic priority for the year. This and next year, we plan to transform our pipeline as we advance multiple programs towards a pivotal stage. I will now pass the presentation to our CFO, Jens Holstein.Jens Holstein: Thank you, Ozlem, and a warm welcome to everyone, who dialed into today's call. Before we go into the financial details for the second quarter and the first half of 2023, I'll start with giving you an overview on some key financial figures, which you can find on the next slide. Our total revenues reached EUR1.4 billion for the first half of 2023 and are in line with our expectations, with Q2 being the expected weakest quarter in the year. Our COVID-19 vaccine revenues are as stated and expected before, heavily influenced by seasonal effects, especially now as we have summer in our biggest markets in the Northern Hemisphere. As we have outlined in earlier earnings calls, the revenue development for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to mimic a flu-like setting.I will go into more details concerning our financial guidance in the course of the call, but want to emphasize already now that acknowledging the uncertainties related to the seasonal effect, we reiterate our 2023 COVID-19 vaccine revenue guidance of around EUR5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. With EUR1.4 billion in revenues, we ended the first six months of 2023, with an operating result of EUR91.1 million and generated earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of EUR1.28. With respect to the company's financial position, we ended the second quarter of 2023 with EUR16.8 billion, comprising approximately EUR14.2 billion cash and cash equivalents as well as approximately EUR2.7 billion partly current and non-current security investments, which are part of our investment strategy.Subsequent to the end of the quarter in July 2023, we received EUR1.1 billion in cash from our collaboration partner Pfizer settling our gross profit share for the first quarter of 2023, alongside with EUR0.4 million received until early August in connection with the amendment COVID-19 vaccine Purchase Agreement with the European Commission. In connection with our acquisition of InstaDeep, which closed on July 31, approximately EUR450 million were invested in form of cash and shares, not including potential future milestones. Overall, with this strong cash position in the background, we are on track to launch our new variant adapted COVID-19 vaccine and intend to start multiple clinical trials across oncology and infectious disease pipeline, such as the ones with OncoC4 and Duality Biologics that Ugur just mentioned earlier.I'll be moving to our financial results for the second quarter of 2023 as shown on the next slide. Our total revenues reported reached EUR166.4 million for the second quarter compared to EUR3.2 billion for the comparative prior year period and decreased with the corresponding lower COVID-19 vaccine market demand. Write-off by our collaboration partner Pfizer, significantly reduced our gross profit share in the second quarter and hence negatively influenced our revenues for the three months ended June 2023. Let me move to cost of sales, which amounted to EUR162.9 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR764.6 million for the comparative prior year period. For the first six months of 2023, the cost of sales reached EUR258.9 million compared to EUR2.1 billion for the comparative prior year period.The changes in line with the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine itself. Research and development expenses reached EUR373.4 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR399.6 million for the comparative prior year period. For the first six months of 2023, research and development expenses amounted to EUR707.4 million compared to EUR685.4 million for the comparative prior year period. Our R&amp;D expenses are mainly influenced by progressing clinical studies for pipeline candidates. The development of variant adapted as well as next generation COVID-19 vaccines and the expansion of our R&amp;D headcount. General and administrative expenses amounted to EUR122.7 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to EUR130 million for the comparative prior year period.For the first six months of 2023, G&amp;A expenses reached EUR242.1 million compared to EUR220.8 million for the comparative prior year period. While in Q2, some cost savings have been achieved, G&amp;A expenses for the first six months were mainly influenced by increased expenses for IT services as well as expanding the G&amp;A headcount. Due to a loss making second quarter of 2023 and the tax effect of a reorganization of the intellectual property rights within the group, income taxes worth an amount of EUR221.8 million were realized compared to tax expenses of EUR647.3 million included for the comparative prior year period. In total, for the first six months of 2023, income taxes were realized with an amount of EUR16.3 million. Tax income compared to EUR2 billion tax expenses, accrued for the comparative prior year period.The derived effective income tax rate for the first six months of 2023 were approximately minus 5.5%, which is expected to change over the 2023 financial year to be in line with the updated estimated annual cash effective income tax rate of somewhere around 21% for the BioNTech group, an improvement that I will elaborate on in a minute. As mentioned at the beginning, due to mainly seasonal effects of our COVID business, we recognized a loss during the second quarter of 2023 amounting to EUR190.4 million, compared to EUR1.7 billion, net profit for the comparative prior year period. For the first six months of 2023, net profit reached EUR311.8 million compared to EUR5.4 billion for the comparative prior year period. Our loss per share for the second quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR0.79 compared to a diluted earnings per share of EUR6.44 for the comparative prior year period.For the first six months of 2023, our diluted earnings per share was EUR1.28 compared to EUR20.65 for the comparative prior year period. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to emphasize that we are updating the company's financial outlook for the 2023 financial year with respect to our planned full year R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses as well as our planned expenses and growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities, excluding effects caused by or driven from in-licensing arrangements, collaborations, or M&amp;A transactions. Please note that the following numbers reflect current base case projections and are calculated based on constant currency rate and do not include further transactions that could occur in the second half of 2023. As stated before, we reiterate our estimated COVID-19 vaccine revenues of around EUR5 billion for the full 2023 financial year.Our guidance is based on the expectation that the demand in our vaccine will pick-up in the year's third and fourth quarter along with our rollout of the adapted COVID-19 vaccine against the XBB 1.5. During the second quarter of 2023, the COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Agreement with the European Commission has been amended. The agreed re-phasing of deliveries annually through 2026 will play an important role in the future as revenues will be recognized over the expenditure. With the EC contract, giving us a level of clarity in terms of revenue expectations, the demand and vaccination rates in other territories as for example, the U.S. market remain uncertain regarding these metrics. Our collaboration partner Pfizer confirmed its plans to achieve its goals for their markets.Given their detailed plans to support an increase in vaccination rates in the U.S., we expect to achieve our revenue guidance range as previously mentioned. However, substantial uncertainties underlie the demand for COVID-19 vaccines in general as well as for our vaccine, due to the timing of its approval will have an impact on its demand. There has been no precedent on how COVID-19 vaccine rates will evolve after years of a pandemic where people have been vaccinated multiple times. We expect to learn from this for future years, but we assume that 2023 will be a very special one, given the mentioned circumstance. It is our aim to move our clinical programs forward as quickly and cost efficiently as possible towards becoming a multi-product company.To do so, we have implemented further measures to increase cost consciousness, which led to a company-wide cost optimization and hence reduction of our expected 2023 R&amp;D, SG&amp;A spend and capital expenditures. The increased flexibility at the expenditure level will help us navigate for the just described uncertainties while remaining focused on the development of the next wave of innovation in various fields and indications. And summarized for you on this slide, we'll update our R&amp;D spending for the rest of 2023 from between EUR2.4 billion and EUR2.6 billion to between EUR2 billion and EUR2.2 billion, including the R&amp;D development costs identified from our latest publicly announced M&amp;A activities. We also update our SG&amp;A expenses from the EUR650 million to EUR750 million now to between EUR600 million and EUR700 million and reduce our spending for growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities from between EUR500 million and EUR600 million to between EUR350 million and EUR450 million.As noted before, we have updated our group estimated annual cash effective income tax rate from around 27% to around 21%, excluding potential effects from share based payment settlement in the course of 2023. Following a reorganization of the intellectual property rights within the group, we recognize deferred tax effects in Germany and the U.S., previously unrecognized U.S., federal, and state deferred tax assets, including unused tax losses in unused tax credits have been evaluated and now recognized. The recognition of these deferred tax assets lead to a decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2023. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Strategy Officer, Ryan Richardson for an update on our strategic outlook for 2023 and concluding remarks.Thank you.Ryan Richardson: Thank you, Jens. I'll now provide a brief summary of the commercial outlook for our updated COVID-19 vaccine launch and provide an update on our acquisition of InstaDeep before concluding with our strategic outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond. I would like to touch on our key readiness activities that have put us in a strong position to execute on our planned launch this fall. On the back of the regulatory recommendation for an XBB.1.5 adapted monovalent vaccine, we and Pfizer have made more than 40 regulatory submissions in key geographies around the world. We are on track to begin vaccine distribution once regulatory approval is received with first shipments expected from September onwards. We believe Comirnaty is positioned to maintain its leading position in multiple key geographies.Most of the world will continue to be supplied under existing pandemic booster contracts. This includes our contract with the European Union, our largest contract, which was recently renegotiated to extend to a period over four years. In the United States, we expect our first major commercial market opening where we will leverage Pfizer's commercial capabilities. Turning to the next slide. This week, we announced that our acquisition of InstaDeep has closed following receipt of all required approvals. With the acquisition we add world-class AI and machine learning technologies and research capabilities to accelerate and enhance our broader strategic vision. The acquisition will bring over 290 data scientists, ML engineers, and tech professionals to our team, positioning us to lead in this disruptive new field.And combining InstaDeep's AI and ML expertise with our own research and development capabilities, we aim to develop novel therapeutic and vaccine product candidates with increased speed and efficiency. We also see opportunities to leverage these AI and ML capabilities outside of R&amp;D across other functions of BioNTech. This makes this a highly strategic acquisition with significant long-term transformational potential across our firm. We will operate InstaDeep as an independent technology subsidiary BioNTech. On the next slide, we show the three pillars of value creation that we expect from this transaction. The first is to apply cutting-edge AI and machine-learning technologies across our therapeutic and vaccine platforms. We plan to connect these AI-enabled discovery capabilities with automated lab infrastructure to enable high throughput drug discovery.While we do expect our overall AI investments to increase in the coming years, we do expect some mid-term cost efficiencies from the acquisition by internalizing our largest AI technology and services provider. Finally, we will continue to operate InstaDeep's third-party business, which delivers technology solutions and services to external customers in the technology sector and other industries. We are excited to kick off the next phase of our collaboration with the leadership and bright minds at InstaDeep and believe that together we can become a global leader in applying cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies to discover, design, and develop next-generation immunotherapy at scale. The next slide provides an overview of our expected pipeline news flow for 2023 and 2024.Some of these points have been covered, so I won't go through them all in detail here. With the collective efforts and dedication from our teams, we've achieved remarkable progress for several of our product candidates. At this year's ASCO congress, we presented data for three of our pipeline candidates. We're on track to share additional data updates across a range of technologies later this year. In June, we initiated our first Phase 3 trial in oncology. Additionally, we started the Phase 2 trial for one of our FixVac candidates in collaboration with Regeneron, focusing on first-line NSCLC. As Ozlem has elaborated, we anticipate initiating several further trials in the near future. On the next slide, I'll summarize the strategic outlook for the remainder of the year.We are on track to roll out our new variant adapted COVID-19 vaccine in the coming month. We also plan to initiate multiple registrational oncology clinical trials while expanding our infectious disease pipeline. With the InstaDeep acquisition now closed, we intend to rapidly scale up our activity in AI-enabled drug discovery and will continue to execute transactions to expand our innovation ecosystem and execute on our corporate development strategy to in license complementary assets. Before concluding and opening up the floor for questions, I'd like to reiterate that we will hold our Innovation Series event on November 7. We'll provide further details on the event in the coming weeks. With that, I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the floor for questions.See also 10 UK Dividend Growth Stocks to Consider and 10 Best Stocks to Buy for a Month. To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.5% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Fox Fox's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Fox's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 49.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendFox Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryThe dividend hasn't seen any major cuts in the past, but the company has only been paying a dividend for 4 years, which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. Since 2019, the dividend has gone from $0.46 total annually to $0.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.1% over that duration. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 7.0% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Fox will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Fox that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

The regulator said approval of an appeal could prevent the SEC and government from needing two trials. The SEC sued Ripple in 2020 on grounds that it was selling an unregistered security.

206,9be29ce2-9468-3393-abce-3fb4a061e203,IBM,2023-08-11,23 Most Gay Friendly Cities in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/23-most-gay-friendly-cities-200422987.html,1691697862,STORY,"['SCHW', 'IBM', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we discuss the 23 most gay friendly cities in the US. You can skip our detailed analysis of gay rights in the US and head directly to 10 Most Gay Friendly Cities in the US.There’s a significant population of gay individuals and couples in the US. A Census Bureau report shows that that there were nearly a million homosexual couple households in the US in 2017 and 51.7% of them belonged to female homosexual couples.The US has been relatively slower to recognize same-sex marriage. In 2015 a supreme court ruling legalized same-sex marriages in all US states. For comparison, the same-sex marriage has been legal in the Netherlands since the year 2000. However, sexual acts between people of the same-sex have been legal since 2003 in the US which was a direct result of the ruling of the famous case of Lawrence vs Texas.The supreme court made some critical rulings ensuring the LGBT people could freely marry in the same-sex and would not be discriminated against for employment, based on their sexual orientation, among others. However, despite constitutional legalization, many homosexual individuals continue to experience social discrimination in some parts of the country, especially in the relatively conservative and religious south.There are many aspects of social life where gay people face discrimination such as housing. According to American Progress, LGBT youth make up 5–10% of the American youth population but make up 20–40% of homeless youth. While some states have protection for the LGBT community in terms of housing, other states are still relatively behind the curve.The social dynamics seem to be working in favor of homosexuality in general. According to a Pew survey, there has been a rising acceptance of homosexuality in the US, with 72% Americans in favor of acceptance in the year 2019, up from 51% in the year 2002.However, current problems faced by the homosexual community has caused many to relocate within the country to more friendly states and cities. This has caused demographics to dramatically change in some parts of the country with gay people representing significant percentage of the population in these areas.Story continuesThere are interesting correlations between the gay population density as well as the cities’ diversity and and the general political leanings. To give you an example, the more diverse and liberal a city, the more gay people being part of their populations according to a paper published in the Journal of Sex Reserach. These cities are usually also far more industrialized which allows for inclusive economic opportunities regardless of race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. For example, companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) are known for their inclusive hiring of employees regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation. So liberal and more industrialized cities play in favor of the LGBT community, particularly homosexuals.The purpose of this article is to list the 23 most gay friendly cities in America.23 Most Gay Friendly Cities in the USPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyOur core axiom is that cities with the highest gay populations is an indirect indicator of the respective cities' friendliness towards them. So we have ranked cities based on number of same-sex couples per 1000 households in ascending order. We have used data from Williams Institute. It is a policy research institute with a focus on sexual orientation and gender identity. It is based at the Law School at University of California, Los Angeles.We have also mentioned the cities’ populations to give readers a general idea about the population of homosexuals around the US. The source for US cities’ population is from the US Census Bureau. We've additionally used another metric to broaden reader-perspective. It’s the 2022 scores from Human Rights Campaign’s Municipal Equality Index (MEI) for different cities. The MEI of Human Rights Campaign (HRC) assigns scores to different cities based on the levels of non-discriminatory legislations and social equality among many other equality metrics for LGBT community.Our methodology is based on city dynamics. Rankings may differ if the respective states' policies are factored in. Also read 20 Most Dangerous Countries for LGBTQ+ Americans.Let’s move down to the list of 23 gayest cities in the US.23.

208,dc635c01-e3dd-326b-9fcf-f32ae0cb25cd,IBM,2023-08-11,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130011275.html,1691672411,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share, indicating a change of +17.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.84 indicates a change of +4.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5%. The $61.48 billion and $64.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The underperformance could be attributed to a fall in the retail gasoline price and fuel contribution, partly offset by higher-than-expected petroleum product sales.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.6 billion fell 17.5% year over year and came below the consensus mark by $22 million.Merchandise sales, at $1 billion, rose 5.5% year over year and outperformed our estimate of $994 million. Revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4.5 billion, ahead of our estimate of $4.4 billion but down 21.8% from the second quarter of 2022.Murphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Murphy USA Inc. Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution fell 13.5% year over year to $365.8 million despite a slight margin improvement. This could be attributed to a drop in total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results), which came in at 29.5 cents per gallon, 15.5% lower than the second quarter of 2022.Retail fuel contribution increased 4.3% year over year to $334.7 million as margins, at 27 cents per gallon, edged up 1.9% from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 2.3% from the year-ago period to 1,238.8 million in the quarter under review but missed our projection of 1,241.9 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) dropped 1.1% from the second quarter of 2022 to 245.2 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.21 per gallon, down from $4.21 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 5.1% to $206.8 million on higher sales, which more than offset the marginal fall in unit margins, from 19.8% a year ago to 19.7% in the second quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 2.8% year over year, primarily on the back of 2.9% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 2.7% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were down 0.6% from the prior-year period, though merchandise sales increased 2.9% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Jun 30, Murphy USA — which opened seven new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,725 — had cash and cash equivalents of $92.9 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 70.4%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $95.1 million.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s second-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.87, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to lower expenses. The positives were partially offset by PSX’s declining refining margins worldwide.For the reported quarter, Phillips 66 generated $955 million of net cash from operations, down from $1.8 billion a year ago. PSX’s capital expenditure and investments totaled $551 million. It paid out dividends of $474 million in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $3 billion. Meanwhile, Phillips 66 reported total debt of $19.9 billion, reflecting a consolidated debt to capitalization of 39%.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The EPS of $5.40 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.08. This was on account of VLO’s increased renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in total costs of sales.At the end of the second quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.3 billion. Valero’s second-quarter capital investment was $458 million. Of the total, $382 million was allotted for sustaining the business.Finally, we have Marathon Petroleum MPC. It reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.32, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 on the back of lower costs and expenses. In the second quarter, MPC repurchased $3.1 billion of shares and a further $800 million worth of shares in July. The company currently has a remaining authorization of $6.3 billion.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $562 million on capital programs (43% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 48% on the Midstream segment) compared to $577 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, MPC had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 46.3%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CRBG, General Motors Co. GM, Ford Motor Co. F and Magna International Inc. MGA.Pick These Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your PortfolioValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Corebridge Financial, Inc., General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Magna International Inc. boast low P/CF ratios.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Corebridge Financial, which provides retirement solutions and insurance products, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 23.5% for three to five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.3%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corebridge Financial’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 23% and 45.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Corebridge Financial has a Value Score of A. The stock has decreased 10.9% in the past year.General Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.9% for three to five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.6%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ current financial year sales suggests growth of 9% from the year-ago period. General Motors has a Value Score of A.

General Motors: It certainly looks like an ideal time to invest in General Motors with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).After impressively beating second-quarter top and bottom line expectations in late July, General Motors’ stock still appears to be overlooked. General Motors’ annual earnings are now expected to be virtually flat this year and dip -5% in FY24 at $7.17 per share but this would still represent 46% EPS growth over the last five years.Even better, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher since the company’s Q2 report which is a strong indication that GM stock should have more upside ahead. Plus, General Motors stock trades at just 4.7X forward earnings with the rising EPS estimates supporting the notion that GM shares are cheap.Ford Motor: Along with General Motors, Ford’s stock is worthy of investors’ consideration at the moment and currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Ford also blasted Q2 expectations in late July with earnings projected to rise 9% this year at $2.05 per share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to drop -8% after what would be a tougher to compete-against year. However, FY24 EPS projections of $1.88 per share would represent a very stellar 358% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $0.41 a share.Furthermore, EPS estimates have remained higher over the last 30 days and Ford stock trades at 6.2X forward earnings.

Earnings of $1.60 per share crushed Q1 estimates of $0.99 a share by 61% with sales of $33.69 billion topping estimates of $33.56 billion.Annual earnings are anticipated to soar 33% in Honda’s current fiscal 2024 to $4.04 per share. Plus, FY25 earnings are expected to rise another 3%. Earnings estimates have remained higher and could continue to go up following Honda’s strong Q1 results. This also makes Honda stock look attractive at 7.9X forward earnings which is roughly on par with its own industry average and well below the benchmark.Bottom LineInvestors will not want to overlook these automakers as their growth stories and valuations are very attractive.

The company acquired failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, which is expected to be accretive to earnings. The deal adds almost $173 billion in loans and will increase market share among wealthy clients.Higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a decent loan demand will support net interest income (NII). Moreover, supported by solid earnings strength, the company will be able to sustain enhanced capital deployments.Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging.

The acquisition of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and placed at a better competitive position against Microsoft’s Teams product.However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects in the near-term.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Abbott Laboratories have declined -2.0% over the past six months against the Zacks Medical - Products industry’s decline of -2.9%. The company is facing steep year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales hurt growth. Further, the decision to exit the pediatric nutrition business in China might impede overall growth in the coming period.Nevertheless, Abbott is strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for advanced medical technologies. Within the EPD business, which is solely based in emerging markets. Within Core Diagnostics, Abbott is gaining market share following the end of the public health emergency, particularly in the United States and Europe region.Within Diabetes Care, Abbott is scaling up the production of Libre and gaining reimbursement approval in several countries.

I couldn’t be certain what the captain was dealing with,"" the co-pilot later told investigators.The plane's nose continued to pitch down, and the co-pilot saw through the windshield that they were breaking through the cloud cover.“I instantly recognized the severity of our situation,” he said. “I announced, ‘Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up' many times.” The plane’s ground proximity warning system sounded an alarm too.From more than 2,200 feet (670 meters), the Boeing 777 plunged more than 1,400 feet (427 meters) toward the Pacific Ocean before the pilots — who were not named in the report — were able to recover, according to the NTSB.The captain said he decided to continue on to San Francisco after the chief flight attendant told him that “everyone was OK” and there was no apparent damage to the plane. The rest of the trip was routine.There were 271 passengers and 10 crew members on board. The 55-year-old captain had nearly 20,000 hours of flying experience, a considerable amount. The co-pilot had 5,300 hours of flight time.Both are still flying for United, the airline said.“There's nothing more important than the safety of our crew and customers, which is why we’re drawing on the lessons learned from this flight to inform the training of all United pilots,” said United spokesman Joshua Freed. “Our pilots voluntarily reported this event and United fully cooperated with the independent investigation” to improve safety for the entire industry.Story continuesThe Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates airlines, said earlier this year that the United pilots reported the incident under a voluntary safety-reporting program. The FAA said it reviewed the incident “and took appropriate action.""The incident attracted little attention until an aviation publication, The Air Current, reported on its analysis of data gathered from the plane.The NTSB did not learn of the incident for two months, by which time information from the so-called black boxes had been recorded over.The United flight took place on the same day that 36 people were hurt, 11 of them seriously, when a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Phoenix hit severe turbulence as it approached Honolulu. The National Weather Service had issued an advisory for thunderstorms and unstable air in the area.___This report has been corrected to note that the flight took off from Maui, not Honolulu.]"

Since the fund launched, more than 60,000 United customers have contributed a total of more than $200,000.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. To date, United has invested in the future production of over five billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.1""While United can't decarbonize the airline industry alone, we can use our leadership and credibility in this space to rally others to join us,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen. ""Our new and inaugural participants demonstrate the impressive commitment within aviation and beyond to reduce our carbon footprint and combat the threat of climate change. As companies across the globe are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact from flying, the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund presents a unique opportunity - instead of fighting over the current limited supply of SAF, with our partners, we're working collaboratively to help scale the SAF industry itself, and to get an equity stake in groundbreaking technology while doing it.""Story continuesUnited will continue to recruit corporations across industries to join the fund and will prioritize investment in new technology, advanced fuel sources, and proven producers - all in an effort to help scale the supply of SAF. Partners also have the potential to gain preferential access to environmental attributes associated with United's future supply of SAF.SAF, which currently must be blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements for use within the aircraft, is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste. Through the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United intends to invest in a variety of SAF feedstocks and technologies. With the right policy incentives to produce SAF, United's efforts could help build a future of sustainable flight.UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM launched with more than $100 million in investments from United and its inaugural partners Air Canada, Boeing, GE Aerospace, JPMorgan Chase, and Honeywell. Through the fund, these partners and additional corporate participants will invest alongside United in SAF technology and production start-ups identified by United. In the past two years alone, United Airlines Ventures has already made investments in or signed purchase agreements with companies using a variety of ingredients and technologies to produce SAF, including feedstocks like ethanol, animal byproducts, forestry and crop waste, and municipal waste, as well as early-stage, promising technologies like synthetic biology and power to liquids, incorporating renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture processes. United Airlines Ventures has moved selected existing SAF investments into the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM to establish the fund's portfolio.Consumer Awareness and Call to ActionAs part of the fund launch, consumers booking through United for travel within or from the U.S. have an option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM before check-out. Customers have the choice to contribute $1, $3.50 or $7.00. Since the launch, more than 60,000 United customers have contributed for a total of more than $200,000.The default option for customer contributions is set at $3.50 to illustrate the potential impact of customer action at scale: if the 152 million people who flew on United in 2022 each contributed just $3.50 to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, that would be enough to design and build a SAF refinery capable of producing as much as 40 million gallons of alternative fuel annually.2United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis. In May 2023, United received validation of our 2035 near-term emissions reduction target from the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to reduce our carbon intensity 50% from a 2019 base year. This year, United became the first U.S. airline to show customers an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint in their search.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The Way. With U.S. hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., United operates the most comprehensive global route network among North American carriers and is now the largest airline in the world as measured by available seat miles.

While customers can earn 5% off their order if using the Target Red Card, they will not receive Starbuck rewards points.""Our guests have long told us Drive Up is a game-changer, adding convenience to their daily life, especially when they're short on time,” Mark Schindele, chief stores officer at Target, said in a statement. “Although Target first introduced Drive Up in 2018, this one-of-a-kind service with Starbucks, available only at Target, is the latest example of how we're innovating every day to meet the needs of our guests.""20-year partnershipTarget said that stores currently offering Drive Up with Starbucks report that the service is proving popular with iced brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso, birthday cake pop and iced caramel macchiato as the three top-selling items.Target said it is the first retailer to offer this service at this scale, which builds on a more than 20-year partnership with Starbucks and offers customers the convenience of curbside pickup while also growing customer loyalty.Earlier this summer, Target also enhanced its Drive Up service by allowing customers to make product returns curbside for free.As Kiplinger previously reported, Target started a pilot program involving curbside pickup for Starbucks items in 2022 and began working on the feature in 2021Curbside pickup became a mainstream option for shoppers during the pandemic, with retailers like the Gap, Kohls, Walmart and many grocery stores launching the feature for the first time in 2020, according to a Modern Retail report.Apple Shops Are Popping Up in Target StoresNew Target Stores Will Be HugeKiplinger's Retail Outlook: Consumers Cautious, But Still Spending]"

Well, big name retailers, including Walmart and Target, gearing up to report their quarterly results next week, and it certainly is a tricky year for retailers as they navigate what is becoming a more cautious consumer. So what names should you buy, and what should you sell? We want to bring in James Demmert. He's Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer, along with Brian Mulberry, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager. Great to have both of you.Brian, let me start with you. We talk about the fact that it's a tough environment here for retailers. More and more consumers-- we've seen this trend over the last couple of quarters. More consumers starting to trade down. Walmart is one of your picks. What gives Walmart the edge in this environment?Story continuesBRIAN MULBERRY: As you guys have been talking about, inflation has been a big impact on bottom lines across the board. Just simply the cost of doing business, labor and supply chain issues have made things difficult for a lot of these retailers. But Walmart has been a cash flow generating machine. And the more cash flow that you have, that you can reinvest in your own business without having to leverage right now is going to be a key difference as we go forward.I agree with a lot of the other comments made earlier today in that interest rates are likely just to stay higher for longer than the equity markets currently have priced in. Not that we have a huge disagreement about we might be at the top terminal rate or one more hike to go, but we don't see the rate cuts in the future. That just simply means the cost of doing business in the future continues to stay high.So these companies like Walmart, that continue to generate an enormous amount of cash flow, have that capital to reinvest in themselves organically and grow. And they've done so. They've made huge investments in their e-commerce segment, primarily to combat what they have in terms of direct competition with Amazon. And they're gearing up their home delivery services. And so they're using that cash flow to their advantage in this highly competitive sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So, James, let's pick up on that point. I mean, you know, Brian, looking essentially where consumers are going right now, especially with tighter wallets, talking about cash flow investments in e-commerce, is this a name that you would get in on? How are you looking at the retail space?JAMES DEMMERT: It is a name that we find attractive without question. And one of the few rules that we have, particularly in what I consider a stock picker's market, is the three most important things in retail which is brand management, brand itself, management, and as Brian mentioned, indebtedness.It's very important here that companies have very strong balance sheets and that brand awareness and really, really great management. And I think that's going to be a key issue as we go through the hurdles of stickier inflation and quite some time before the Fed cuts. So we've got a couple names beyond the Walmart that we find very attractive here.SEANA SMITH: And what are those, James?JAMES DEMMERT: The first is, back to our global style, a company like LVMH. Obviously, lifestyles of the rich and famous type of stock. But there again, the one-percenters tend to be pretty consistent through all kinds of economic climates. When we go back to our brand is important, these are probably some of the highest end brands in the world and well known and recognizable. Arnault is probably one of the best managers of a business, and we do buy businesses.And again, debt levels are important. So we want to make sure the company isn't over its skis, let's say, in indebtedness. So really the right mix. And here, you have the stock down about 8% from its high. Really love that as an opportunity to add to the position. Or if investors don't own it, here's a great time to do so.AKIKO FUJITA: James, really quickly. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the announcement that we got today of Capri and Tapestry because we were talking earlier about as much as those companies combined bring in brands under one umbrella, it's still tough to compete with a name like LVMH, which you're invested in.JAMES DEMMERT: I think it is. That's a very good question. And Etsy sort of falls into that same trap, where you've just got too many-- you don't have any brands of significance. You've just got a lot of brands. And I think that's going to be the differentiator for the successful companies over the next 12 months versus the others. So again, I would want to stick again with brand awareness, like a Tractor Supply, which we can talk about as well, has got that very significant presence, as in brand awareness. Really, really important.SEANA SMITH: All right, James, we'll talk about Tractor Supply in just a minute. But Brian, I want to get your thoughts here just on the luxury consumer given the fact that it sounds like you see a lot of the opportunity being at the other end of the market, the lower income market.BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, and it's certainly that we don't acknowledge the luxury brand. There has been a lot of durability there in spending from consumers. And we think a lot of that has to do with the fact most of those higher end, higher income individuals were able to take advantage of the low in the rate hike-- in the rate cycle and refinance usually what is their biggest debt, which is their mortgage. And that has cleaned up their balance sheet. And so their spending has been growing even more so than what you would see in the low to mid-income range.So there's absolutely a reason to have those types of companies in your portfolio. We think it absolutely makes a lot of sense. It doesn't mean that we don't like them. It just means that at this point, we're a touch more defensive, leaning a little bit more on free cash flow and operating income. And there's definitely going to be some consolidation, we think, in those brands that James was just talking about.AKIKO FUJITA: With that said, Brian, we started the conversation by talking about Walmart. There's another name that you actually surprisingly don't like, a direct competitor to Walmart. What's different here when you look at a name like Walmart versus Target?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Target really over the last couple of years has had a difficult time managing their inventory. And they now have a new problem where they just acknowledge that they have $500 million worth of shrink or theft coming out of the stores, and a lot of it is because they have so much on clearance and on sale that's really impacted their margins for a very long time coming out of COVID.And this affected a lot of people trying to get their actual goods landed in stores. And it had a ripple effect when you had a whole bunch of nonseasonable wares in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so they made a decision to try and clear out that inventory and not have to wait on it, but it has impacted their margins to a point where there's a little bit of a capitulation in confidence in the company, and that's starting to get reflected in their margins going forward as well.And so it's not that target is a bad company, they're just kind of stuck in a bad spiral, and they're really going to have to work hard to get out of that. Again, this puts pressure directly on those metrics that we like. Operating income, free cash flow, they've all been in pretty substantial decline over the last three or four quarters. And we don't see it improving until maybe three years from now that they can work themselves out of this particular hole.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Target shares off just about 12% so far this year. James, getting back to what you just said a moment ago, and that's Tractor Supply. You talked about the brand awareness, but this is also a stock that hasn't done much since the start of the year. What's the bull case here for Tractor Supply?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah. It's a stock like many of the stocks outside of the Super Seven tech that has gone a long way this year. And I think that the valuation should be the first thing that's attractive, right? PE, multiple versus growth. Then back to brand awareness. This is the leader in gardening, and even farm equipment, and all kinds of stuff that you'd like to do in the garden.And so one of the things and themes outside of brand awareness, which of course, they're the kingpin, is this incredible move by millennials to the outer parts, the more rural parts of the country and not just here in the United States. So Tractor Supply started in 1938. I mean, they are the brand. They're continuing to open new stores. So you have that expansion growth story.You've got brand awareness, as we talked about before. And wow, do they have high margins and extremely well managed business, as opposed to what Brian mentioned, the Target situation, which is sort of a mismanagement there. On the Tractor Supply, you've got excellent management, great valuation, and you've got that millennial push. They're opening stores. All the right mix of a company that yes, maybe hasn't done tremendously well so far this year but probably will in the back half of this year into 2024.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Brian, let's end on a positive note, sort of staying in the home improvement space. Home Depot, one of those stocks that you say you like. We've seen a bit of a transition in terms of what is driving revenue for Home Depot. We kind of went through the pandemic where there was this huge, huge push in DIY. Since then, it's kind of moved in a different direction. What are you liking what the company is doing right now?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Again, a lot of investments in where future revenue is going to come from at Home Depot. They moved away from that DIY segment and put a lot into their pro development. And these are the licensed contractors, the actual professionals that can come in and do projects for you. And that's been a big transition in their business. The last 20 years, they've been the DIY kings along with Lowe's. But now they've actually made substantial investments in where they see the future of revenue coming from.And there's a bit of a cycle in the consumer here where they absolutely did home improvements on their own. And then the value of their home went up so substantially, they started to sell it and trade up. And now it's coming back around to where people are going to want to have some projects and some improvements done. and Home Depot has by far and away made great investments in being ahead of that curve, so that they can supply the contractors with everything that they need to get those jobs done.And that's important right now because the contractors are making more money now than they ever have been because of the short supply of their skill set and skilled labor. And so being able to have a trusted partner where you can actually work very conveniently with your own personal representative online again in an e-commerce way, go pick up the materials that you need, it makes you more efficient. It makes you able to do more projects that's better for your bottom line and Home Depot. That's why we like them.AKIKO FUJITA: You've given us a lot to think about in the retail space both of you, James Demmert and Brian Mulberry. Good to talk to both of you. Really appreciate the time.]"

Target recalls 2.2 million products over burn and laceration risks,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-threshold-candle-recall-target-164933480.html,1691686173,STORY,['TGT'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — It's time to check your candle supply again. According to a Thursday notice from federal regulators, Target is recalling 2.2. million candles due to laceration and burn hazards.The recall impacts Threshold-branded glass jar candles sold in multiple sizes and various scents — including frosted vanilla cupcake, rose petal &amp; lotus, blue agave &amp; cactcus and pumpkin spice, among others.According to Thursday's notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the jars of these candles can break during use, risking burns and lacerations. Target has received 19 reports of candle jars breaking or cracking during use for this recall, the CPSC said, resulting in one minor injury.Consumers with the recalled Threshold products should “should immediately stop using” them, Thursday’s notice said. The candles can be returned to any Target store or by mail for a full refund.The products under recall can be identified by size, scent and item numbers listed on the CPSC website and Target’s recall page.The now-recalled 2.2 million candles were sold at Target stores nationwide and the Minneapolis-based retailer’s website from February 2020 through July 2023. Prices ranged from $3 to $12, the CPSC said.This isn’t the first time Threshold candles have been under recall. Back in May, Target recalled nearly 5 million Threshold candles over similar safety concerns. At the time of that recall, Target received 137 reports of the candles’ jars breaking or cracking during use and six injuries, including lacerations and severe burns.It’s unclear if the May recall is connected to this week's announcement, but Thursday's notice listed some different product scents and distribution dates. The Associated Press reached out to Target for comment on Thursday.Beyond Target, candles sold at other retailers have also been recalled this year — including Mainstays-branded products sold at Walmart. In February, Star Soap Star Candle Prayer recalled 1.2 million Mainstays Three-Wick Candles because the wicks burned too close to the edge, causing some jars to break.]"

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-intuitive-110038228.html,1691751638.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Let's talk about the popular Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$355 and falling to the lows of US$301. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$305 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What Is Intuitive Surgical Worth?Intuitive Surgical is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 75.12x is above its peer average of 35.21x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 75% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuitive Surgical. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ISRG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ISRG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ISRG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Intuitive Surgical from their most recent forecasts.

Photo: Courtesy Empire State Realty TrustA number of public real estate investment trusts (REITs) with heavy exposure to the office market beat estimates in second-quarter earnings with assists from outside capital, according to new analysis from Barclays (BCS).The Barclays research released Thursday morning looked at 18 REITs with “substantial exposure” to the office sector, 13 of which reported a year-over-year decline in occupancy. Eight of the REITs included in the analysis reported that net operating income (NOI) fell by more than 10 percent, “giving cause for concern, both for these specific REITs and for the broader office sector,” Barclays analysts Lea Overby and Anuj Jain wrote. “We expect that operating metrics across the wider office market are weaker than those reported by the office REITs, as these institutional owners likely have better access to diversified funding sources, including the corporate market,” the analysts wrote. The largest office REIT, BXP (formerly Boston Properties (BXP)), reported a decline in occupancy across its portfolio in the second quarter to 88.3 percent from 89.5 percent, but its overall results were “better than consensus,” thanks to a 5.5 percent NOI jump.  Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), the second-largest office REIT, whose primary focus is on the life sciences sector, saw a year-over-year occupancy dip from 94.6 percent to 93.6 percent. But, similar to BXP, it saw its NOI jump 3 percent to beat estimates.The REIT with the biggest occupancy improvement was Empire State Realty Trust, with a 3.1 percent jump to 86.6 percent. While some occupancy numbers were better than projected, three of the office REITs tracked by Barclays reported NOI fell by more than 10 percent year-over year in the second quarter. These REITs include Equity Commonwealth (down 14.8 percent), Paramount Group (a 13 percent decline) and JBG Smith (JBGS) (down 10.8 percent). Overby and Jain said these numbers give “cause for concern, both for these specific REITs and for the broader office sector.”Story continuesAndrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com. Trending Commercial Observer StoriesMargaritaville Resort in SoFlo Nabs $140MMoney Never Sleeps: Newmark Is Aiming for the Capital Markets CrownNew York City Offering Some Wiggle Room for Local Law 97 ComplianceApollo Lends $90M on Brooklyn Retail Property Anchored by Whole FoodsPassive House Construction Works Financially.

And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Ford, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Scott?Story continuesScott Thomas FordThank you for joining us this afternoon, and thank you, Clay. In a few moments, Chris Pledger, our CFO, will review our second quarter financial performance and preview our thinking on the second half of 2023.Calendar year '23 carries meaningful costs related to major equipment and systems upgrades and additional overhead expense required to prepare us for the next few years. These impacts are largely transitory in nature and best behind us rather than in front of us as we prepare to open our new Conway facility. At each decision point along the way over the past year, we chose securing our success in launching the new extract, an RTD plant in Conway over maximizing this year's earnings. But before I turn the call over to Chris for his update, allow me to spend a few minutes updating you on this new Conway facility. As followers of West know, Conway is our single most important and impactful project. Its successful completion and commercial production launch will radically alter the overall profitability and trajectory of the company. Our recent $119 million equity raise provides the funding necessary for the timely completion of the packaging lines originally envisioned and announced, a high-speed can line, a high-speed glass bottle line, multi-serve bottle line and BiB and bulk packaging capabilities. But importantly, this recent raise also funds the installation of a second and third can line and a state-of-the-art product development lab and pilot plant. Today, we are pleased to announce that the original can and glass bottle packaging lines are sold out. We have more customer demand than available capacity for our multi-serve line and we've begun discussions with prospective customers who we expect to speak for the available capacity of our 2 new can lines before they even come online.In addition to this material good news, our recent fundraising also enables us to invest in 1 to 3 new aseptic or ESL cold chain multi-serve bottle line, 2 to 3 years ahead of our original 5-year plan assumption. While we're still working out the details of this specific investment, we're confident that we have multiple paths available to us to bring this capability online much sooner than originally foreseen. These new multi-serve bottle lines, together with the glass bottle line, 3 can lines and 3 aseptic Bag-in-a-Box lines will enable us to produce a range of products, including ready-to-drink beverages, concentrate and our exciting new line of energy products for retail and foodservice customers as well as our branded CPG customers.So in simple terms, what does this mean to our EBITDA forecast and the timing thereof for the Conway facility once complete. We previously estimated this plant would be full in 2027 and that once full, would generate approximately $100 million in incremental annual EBITDA from the packaging lines previously announced. Due to the developments we are announcing today, we now estimate our once full annual EBITDA run rate will be closer to $125 million to $150 million. Just 12 months ago, when we went public, we laid out our intention to build a 500,000 square foot combined manufacturing and distribution facility that would house a collection of dry and extract-based coffee packaging equipment and serve as a distribution center. We then updated that plan, given the strong customer demand for our product by adding a separate stand-alone 500,000 square foot distribution center as a companion operation to the manufacturing plant and by increasing the RTD lines we would install in the original building.What was simply an idea to fill an industry niche has now been upsized multiple times over with the vast majority of those products, some 70% to 80% of the original and expanded capacity already spoken for by customers. This is 9 months before the first product ever rolls off the line. We are obviously very encouraged by these recent developments. The exponential upsizing of this project over the past year was brought about by customer demand for the types of products this facility will produce and the work of the most extraordinary team I've ever been a part of.Our sales and product development teams have worked tirelessly with customers and in our labs, the engineering, production, operations and construction crews are on the verge of completing not only 1 world-class 0.5 million-plus square foot facility, but 2 of them. Our procurement, accounting and support teams have worked nonstop to ensure the raw materials and neural networks are in place and appropriately scaled up before we even turn on the lights. And our core investors and lenders have stepped forward to provide the financial resources required for this rapid escalation.I believe we are on the verge of building a uniquely purposeful and profitable global business, and I'm not alone in that assessment. The Westrock Coffee leadership team has been enhanced by the arrival of some of the most seasoned professionals in the beverage creation and production industry. This includes more than a dozen new leaders each with more than 20 years of experience for key roles in project management, plant management, manufacturing accounting, quality assurance and quality control and in the engineering, installation and operation of the same equipment we are installing in Conway from major CPGs and product manufacturers such as Pepsi, Dairy Farmers of America, Dean, Yum!, General Mills, Land O'Lakes, et cetera, just to name a few. The impact this combined business has on millions of smallholder farmers and their families in 35 countries around the world is literally life changing. And our unending thanks goes to our customers who have selected us as their coffee, tea and extract partner and have stayed with us through the challenge of our very rapid scale-up. The employee group that delivers on this mission daily often without recognition or praise, the communities we live and work in, which have cheered for us incessantly and extended a helping hand over and over again, and our investors, who took a meaningful chance and supported us along this entire journey. All of these people deserve our thanks, our continued candor and financial success for themselves. Our aim is to deliver just exactly that over the next 3 to 5 years.At this point in time, I'll turn the call over to Chris and let him take you through a review of our current operations and financial results.Thomas Christopher PledgerThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Since this is the first opportunity we have to talk about our recent capital markets activity, I'll begin my remarks by providing some context for both our recent equity raise and credit agreement amendment. After that, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and end with an update on our 2023 outlook.As Scott mentioned, when we went public last August, we did so with the 2-part strategy. First, we wanted to expand our flavors, extracts and ingredients platform through the build-out of our Conway extract and RTD facility; and second, we wanted to expand internationally with our blue-chip customer base. Our go-public transaction was designed to provide us with all the capital we needed to jump start that plan. As we began 2023, a few things became apparent. First, customer demand for the products we plan to produce out of our Conway facility exceeded our expectations, both in terms of volume and in the variety of formats our customers wanted. Second, this customer demand and the opportunities it presented was growing faster than our ability to access the capital we needed to fund them under the terms of our existing credit facility. And third, the overall U.S. macroeconomic picture with higher inflation, higher interest rates and the turmoil in the banking sector, created uncertainty around expectations for consumer demand in 2023.Collectively, these factors led us to conclude we needed to build a fortress around our balance sheet to ensure we have the capital necessary to fund the expanded opportunities we were seeing out of our Conway extract and RTD facility and to take advantage of any other opportunities that arose along the way. To accomplish this goal, we look to our lending syndicate to adjust our covenant package, while at the same time, we sought to raise $100 million in equity we could use to keep leverage low, even through the now expanded build-out of the Conway facility. Despite the macroeconomic environment, we were able to successfully execute on both.First, we have a world-class lending syndicate who worked with us to develop a covenant package better suited for the opportunities we are trying to capitalize on in our Conway facility within the accelerated window in which they were being presented. We then were able to raise approximately $119 million through the sale of common stock at $10 per share or go-public price. We raised $69 million from 2 existing Westrock Coffee investors, the Herbert Hunt family and Brown Brothers Harriman, which we took as a strong vote of confidence in our team, our strategy and how we have gone about executing that strategy. We also raised $50 million from 2 new investors who are excited for the opportunity to partner with us as we grow our business. The expansion of our extracts and RTD business in Conway is the gateway to future EBITDA expansion and remains our top strategic priority and key enabler of future growth. The equity investments and credit agreement amendment form part of the capital plan that ensures the complete build-out of the now expanded Conway facility and allows us to remain active as we look for other opportunities to grow the business.Shifting to our second quarter results. Total company net sales for the second quarter were $224.7 million compared to $223.4 million for the second quarter of 2022. Consolidated top line momentum was driven by 11% sales growth in Beverage Solutions, which was partially offset by a 33% decrease in net sales in Sustainable Sourcing &amp; Traceability.Gross profit, excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, decreased $5.6 million to $34.7 million due to a combination of onetime costs associated with our ERP conversion, onetime costs associated with the rapid scale-up of our single-serve platform and higher coffee and production labor cost in Beverage Solutions compared to the prior year quarter.Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million compared to $13.3 million for the second quarter of 2022. On a segment basis, our Beverage Solutions segment contributed $189.7 million of net sales for the second quarter of 2023, which represents year-over-year growth of 11%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2023 was $11.7 million compared to $12.5 million for the prior year second quarter. Overall, our Beverage Solutions segment benefited from 51% growth in the sales of flavors, extracts and ingredient products year-over-year. And although we did not see the economic benefits of our growth in single-serve volume in our second quarter, we feel confident that the operational improvements are in place to drive improved financial performance from this platform in the back half of the year.Turning to our SS&amp;T segment. Sales net of intersegment revenue were $35 million during the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2022, which was driven by lower sales volume as global coffee roasters continue to roast through their buffer stock and we experienced an unfavorable sales mix. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $400,000 compared to positive $800,000 for the prior year second quarter. With respect to capital expenditures, during the second quarter, we deployed approximately $35 million of CapEx, primarily related to our Conway extract and RTD facility. And at quarter end, we had approximately $120 million of consolidated unrestricted cash and undrawn revolving credit commitments.Our consolidated net leverage ratio at June 30 was 4.9x based on LTM adjusted EBITDA. But if you take into account the aggregate gross proceeds from our equity raise, which closed earlier this month, our consolidated net leverage ratio at June 30 would have been 2.7x based on LTM adjusted EBITDA. We believe these investments provide sufficient liquidity to achieve our near-term growth targets and capital expenditure needs.Turning to our outlook for 2023. Today, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided in late June for adjusted EBITDA to reflect flat to up 10% growth over 2022. As we look to the back half of 2023, there are several headwinds that are now behind us. The first is our ERP conversion, which collectively cost us $4 million to $5 million in gross profit in the first half of the year. These costs will be out of our run rate for the second half of 2023.Secondly, the operational challenges of scaling up our single-serve platform and the related costs, which cost us approximately $4 million in the first half of 2023 are largely behind us. These costs will be out of our run rate in the second half of '23 as well. In addition, in the back half of 2023, we'll benefit from new sales coming online, improved operational efficiencies throughout our manufacturing operations and pricing improvements, which helped offset higher material and labor costs we experienced over the past 4 quarters.Finally, we expect to see improvement in our SS&amp;T segment as sales volume and sales mix returned to more normal levels. Just a reminder that this guidance is an estimate of what the company believes is realizable as of the date of this call, and actual results may vary from this guidance and the variations may be material.With that, I'll hand the call back over to Scott for a few closing remarks.Scott Thomas FordThanks, Chris. 14 years ago, we started a small coffee export operation in Rwanda in order to ensure that farmers in that region receive a fair market price for their crop. Many said it couldn't be done. That business ended up creating the world's first fully digitally traceable coffee supply chain, which paved the way for major consumer brands to demand digital price transparency all the way back to the farmer at origin. It literally changed pricing discussions for the entire global industry.We then launched a roasting business in the United States, and got into the single-serve cup manufacturing business when Keryx patents ran out. Many said we could not possibly be successful in such a highly technical venture against an operator with such manufacturing scale. Today, we are one of the leading providers of these products to some of the largest branded retailers in the world.We then purchased the largest provider of coffee and tea to restaurants and C-stores unluckily 3 weeks before COVID shut them down for almost a year. Many predicted we would certainly fail because several other similarly situated did. We survived that and took the nascent coffee extract business that was resident in that business and the core team that had created it and launched what will soon be the largest roast to extract to ready-to-drink plant in the country. And today, we are pleased to share that not only is that plant being considerably upsized, accelerated and is essentially fully funded but its capacity is largely sold out and under contract. I believe that completing the plant and producing and packaging the contracted product is well within the reach of this team now that the capital structure impediments have been fully removed.With that, I'd like to thank you for your interest in Westrock. And I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuSo Scott, I wanted to start off kind of picking up where you left off with the expansion of the Conway facility, the update to the long-term incremental EBITDA from that facility, I think you said $125 million to $150 million versus the original $100 million by 2027. First, is the time frame still the same by 2027 to get to that $125 million to $150 million.And then second, when you cited some of the equipment delays that are impacting this year, to what degree do those linger into next year? And how should we think about the bridge from '23 to that substantially higher EBITDA run rate?Scott Thomas FordYes. So first of all, the time frame is substantially the same. We're using the fifth year of the model, if you will, 2027 when we look at the up and running EBITDA. As we are currently looking at it right now, we will have a fairly hefty, very low debt balance sheet at that point in time. And so my guess is we won't just run it off flat but we -- and we will actually look to continue to invest CapEx to grow our EBITDA. But in the current model, where we are assuming that we go on and let the leverage largely completely unwind, that is apple-to-apple against what we originally forecast when we went public in our SPAC. And so we think that's the apple-to-apple comparison. So the lift, although essentially at the same time frame comes at a moment when we should experience fairly low leverage and is incremental because of the sales and the additional lines that we've been able to put in and get contracted over the last 12 months.As it goes to the equipment delays in single-serve -- I'm sorry...Benjamin Shelton BienvenuNo, you're going, right. I has kind of follow-up. Perfect.Scott Thomas FordYes. So that equipment is all in. We have rebuilt of the almost 20 different machines that we had that had to be installed or rebuilt, we are down to only 3 rebuilds left. That equipment is up and running. Our metrics have largely come back in the line with our experience before we went through the scale up without the equipment that didn't come in.We are very pleased with where we sit at that point. We have built inventory. We are ready for the fall. I -- you can always have some other problem, but the problem that we wrote through for a year where we had a material uptick in demand and the equipment that we had planned to have in to deliver it didn't come in, that is behind us.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. That's great to hear. My second question kind of pivots to the balance sheet a bit. Chris, I think you cited, if you want to call it, pro forma leverage of 2.7x at June 30 with the new investment that you've secured, would you expect to maintain the balance sheet at that level moving forward even as you ramp up the capital spend? And then if you could talk a little bit about why you chose to bring on additional equity investors versus scaling up the balance sheet in the backdrop that we have and why that makes the most sense?Thomas Christopher PledgerWell, I think for us in terms of -- I guess, from a leverage standpoint, I'll answer that one first. The 2.7 on a pro forma basis, I mean, that's going to grow a little bit. My guess is probably 100 basis points or so as we get into the into the teeth of the CapEx spend, which we kind of start now through the end of the first to second quarter of next year. But our goal is to keep leverage low throughout the process. And we were able to do that really in -- from a -- we started a credit agreement and an expansion of our covenant package and then went and raised the equity for 2 reasons.First of all, that we wanted to be able to -- we can use that, obviously, as we grow Conway, but the other thing is to make sure that from an equity perspective, that we've got the dry powder if we want to look at or as other things arise in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matt Smith from Stifel.Matthew Edward SmithScott, I wanted to follow up on your comments around the initial lines for Conway now essentially being fully under contract. Can you talk about how the mix of the business for those lines and the profitability of those contracts compared to your initial expectations as you began to contemplate the Conway project? And then if I could, as you look more into the future at the extract capabilities that will come online in the coming years, have your expectations changed for the mix of that business, the profitability of that business? Or they remain fairly consistent with your initial expectations?Scott Thomas FordYes, super question. When we actually spent time on with the Board this morning. The mix has come in, actually, I would say, better than we expected. We thought that it might be super highly concentrated. It looks like the way that we've landed. And most of this is now, I would say, probably we have room for one more contractual piece on our -- on 1 of the first 2 lines, and then we are down to just the small line available with space.And the spread there is we're probably dealing with 6 of the 10 largest CPG coffee ready-to-drink brands in the country on that set of contracts. So that's the mix expectation that came in a little broader than we thought. The MOQs on it are still very large because the players that are coming in are all large in the space on a relative basis. So we've been very pleased with that.As we look at the expected margins relative to the pricing we assumed when we went out, we were basically right on top of that, plus or minus 10% at an EBITDA level, not at a pricing, at a revenue level. So we're very pleased with that. That's a lot tighter than we actually had any reason to expect we could guess from the market.And then finally, as you look forward, this is, I think, the core driver of the business. And Matt, your question is kind of where we've been living, which is it's reminiscent to me of wireless data. We never got our wireless data -- I used to run a wireless business called Alltel, it doesn't matter now, but we never got our wireless data growth forecast high enough. We just never could guess how much people were going to shift to wireless data away from terrestrial-based wireline networks. And we were -- no matter how much we invested and how aggressive we were, we were always behind the curve. I have seen this curve before, and we are still behind it.We have literally $100 million of additional EBITDA in a pipeline that we are busily trying to find places to make the product to bring it through. We have caught the bus. And we are trying to actually get it to slow down a little, so that we can catch up with it to actually wrestle it down, if you will.Matthew Edward SmithThat's great. If I could follow up with a question around what you're seeing across the industry given the really robust demand that you're speaking of. Are you seeing other capacity plans that may impact just how strong the demand is for the Conway space?Scott Thomas FordI wouldn't want to get out hold myself out as a professional insightful analyst of what other people are doing. I've got all I can say grace over here. We're not seeing a tremendous amount of capacity being discussed. We have customers that are already asking us to go build another facility like the one we're building in Conway in another part of the country. I don't have any idea if that will pan out or not. We have other projects that we're looking at doing to diversify the physical location where we make products. We have other projects. If you look at the ESL line that I mentioned in my comments, where we may go do that in some other form or fashion in addition to the Conway plant. And so we have a, I would say, corporate development effort that is busy all the time trying to find homes for the products that people are trying to buy from us. And it comes from not the capacity of the can or the bottle line, Matt, this is the key thing. It comes from the extract. The extract that we make, the extracts that we match, the extracts that we can create for people is what brings the customer base through our doors. They start in our labs. They don't start with an RFP for putting stuff in a bottle. They start in the labs, and we co-develop a lot of these formulations.And then as we put them in a can or a bottle, they start to then want to be able to put them in all the various form -- packaging forms, if you will. And that experience is what we never guessed we would be -- that is the experience we're having with customers that are so far outrunning what we expected when we started this, that we've doubled the footprint. We're going to put 1 million square feet under production in less than 18 months, and it's woefully short of the products people are talking to us about making and then packaging for them.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sarang Vora from TAG.Sarang VoraGreat on equity raise and progress on the Conway and EBITDA estimates. Just taking a step back, can you help us understand how the facility is in the construction phase right now? Are you on track in terms of getting the equipment, hiring the talent for it because it's a massive project for you guys. So just curious as you have these milestones, like how are you tracking in terms of milestones? Anything that you are more mindful of or anything we should be worried about on -- related to the opening?Scott Thomas FordWell, we can always worry. But at this point in time, we are actually, thank to good Lord ahead of schedule and under budget, not on time, on budget. Now we have a long way to go, but we have equipment that is already being installed. The leadership team is already in place. We have set eyes on physically 90% of the equipment that is coming into Conway in the manufacturing hub where it's being manufactured. The last 10% will be knocked out over the next few weeks.Part of our crew has lived in an airplane around the world, making sure that we physically see it and talk to the engineers that are building it after our experience in the single-serve business where it was going to be here and then it wasn't. So we learned a lesson from that, and we've tried to -- with recency bias, we fixed the last thing that jumped up. Whether or not the weather holds, et cetera, on the distribution center, that's almost -- that's 90% under roof. That's the last thing that has to come under roof. I think we are on track.Now where it could go bumpy is every product that comes through here has to be -- first of all, it has to be created or matched, then it has to go through the commercialization process. Every product has to go through the regulatory process, every line that we turn on has to go through the regulatory process. And everyone wants someone else to go first, right, because these things are difficult to start up as everybody knows. So when we get towards the end of this year, we will give some view about what impact in EBITDA we expect in '24.The '25 number is actually looking really good in terms of where we should be because most people are planning on coming in and taking their full allocation on an annual basis in the back half of '24. Should that waiver? We could have a startup EBITDA transition issue, but I don't think we're going to have a physical start-up issue from where we sit today.Sarang VoraThat's great. And I have just one follow-up question for Chris. Gross margin as such has been -- this is more like a P&amp;L question, but gross margin has been declining past few quarters. And this ERP conversion and systems and equipment and stuff. Do we expect to see a turn in the back half of the year? I know you gave a few reasons why gross margin should be improving. But is it positive in the back half of the year in your estimate, just give...Thomas Christopher PledgerI do think you'll see a turnaround. I think we'll see a turnaround in gross margins. I think what you're seeing is if you go through and add back the specific onetimes that we talked about related to the ERP conversion, the cost of the single-serve platform, getting that where it needed to be and then some of the other costs that we've incurred kind of in the first half of the year that will be out of our run rate in the back half of the year. When you start looking at that, you start to see a shift in margin from the -- going the wrong way to go in the right way. And I think you'll see that in the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Todd Brooks from The Benchmark Company.Todd Morrison BrooksOn Conway, and Scott, you kind of started to get at this question in the previous answer, but I just want to understand. So at one point, this was a very phased project over 3 phases across that window into '27. And now it seems like given the scale of the opportunity and the fact that you've been able to bring this additional capital in, it's not really phased anymore. It's really, okay, (inaudible) 3 lines up, we're matching them with customer needs. What's the right way to think about the EBITDA recognition of the opportunity, the $125 million to $150 million? Is the main bolus of that in '25, '26 with the tag end in '27 and an initial piece of EBITDA in '24? Just -- if you can help us match how these lines are envisioned to come on now with this EBITDA opportunity, that would be a big help.Scott Thomas FordYes. I -- we will give you a really, I would say, a cogent view of that as we get towards the end of this year. But I would think you need to be on the maybe 10% in the first year, and then we will build it up 20% to 50% and then 50% to 75%, 75% to 100%, something like that is what we're expecting. And if we hit that, we actually end up in that 5-year plan essentially unlevered. And so we won't just stop there.But you are right, we have pulled all 3 phases where we were going to use the operation cash -- operating cash flow of the first 2 or 3 lines to build the third and fourth and fifth line, we went on and pulled them all forward. And that's why the $150 million number -- if you go back to some of the discussions we had as we were on the road and people said, how much could it make? That is the number, and those are the 3 phases.Todd Morrison BrooksOkay. Great. Second follow-up now. You guys dealt with ERP in the first half, you dealt with the single-serve issues in the first half. Are you getting to a place where you're feeling a little more front-footed and able to play some more offense versus defense? And how are you going to use that bandwidth to go out and [tag] opportunities to grow the business?Scott Thomas FordYes. Very much the mood has changed. We had established -- we established a really good beachhead in this business from scratch. And then we had a really tough set of battles that the group just stayed focused and thought through. I have not been in a better Board meeting since the day we sold Alltel to private equity in 2007 until today. When the Board went through all of the things that you're asking, plus 1,000 more about our run rate, about our team, about our bandwidth, about our options that are in front of us, about value-creating paths we could pursue. Today was the best Board meeting I've been in 16 years, and it reflects just exactly what you're asking.OperatorAt this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Scott Ford for closing remarks.Scott Thomas FordWell, I want to thank you. I know that this is a start-up venture and they're hard to follow, and they're lumpy, and that's always hard to model. And it's hard to keep up with the changes. But I believe we have turned the corner operationally on the core business. I believe we have upside in the Conway facility that is going to live up to its initial early hopes. And I believe we've got opportunities beyond that, that the balance sheet is going to allow us to pursue that are going to continue to let us leg this business up in a material way over the next several years. And we're excited, but we work here.But I want to thank you for staying with us and for all of the work that you guys do to try to stay up and communicate it back out. So thank you very much for your interest and your time. You guys have a great evening.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

We had expected adjusted operating profit and margin to be $84.3 million and 5.8%, respectively.Segmental DetailsInnerwear: The segment’s sales grew 3% year over year on gains from Full Potential strategy. The upside was driven by growth in the Basics business, greater space for back-to-school, better on-shelf availability and consumer-centric pricing philosophy. The segmental operating margin was 17.6%, up 440 bps.Activewear: Sales decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter’s level due to soft consumer demand and excess channel inventory. The company’s strategic brand-related actions continued to affect Champion sales in the U.S. The segmental operating margin contracted nearly 810 bps.International: Revenues in the International business declined 4% year over year. This included $18 million of unfavorable currency headwinds. We note that Innerwear growth across the Americas and Champion growth in Asia offset softness in Australia stemming from a tough macroeconomic environment. The segmental operating margin stood at 8%, down 520 bps.Other Financial DetailsThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $191.8 million, long-term debt of $3,504.3 million and total stockholders’ equity of almost $348 million.

The metric was expected to be $6.05-$6.20 billion earlier.Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is now likely to be in the $425-$475 million range, including a currency headwind expectation of roughly $5 million.

Results have gained from robust demand and brand strength. The company has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.RL has reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 for the fiscal first quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15. Also, the bottom line rose 24.5% year over year from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter.Net revenues grew 0.4% year over year to $1,496.5 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,482 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 1% from the prior-year quarter. The top line witnessed impacts of 80 basis points (bps) from adverse currency rates. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 15.8% in the past three months against the industry’s 1.4% decline.However, shares of RL declined more than 4% before the trading session on Aug 10. This is expected to have resulted from high interest rates, leading to muted U.S. luxury spending.Segmental DetailsNorth America: In the fiscal first quarter, the segment’s revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $632 million and came below our estimate of $635 million. Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel fell 6% year over year, wherein the same for brick-and-mortar stores moved down 8%, while digital commerce decreased 5%. Revenues from the North America wholesale business advanced 16% year over year.Europe: The segment’s revenues rose 8% year over year to $450 million, with a 7% improvement in currency-neutral revenues. The metric exceeded our estimate of $421 million. Comps for the retail channel in Europe were up 2%, whereas brick-and-mortar stores grew 1% year over year and digital sales witnessed an 8% rise. Revenues for the segment’s wholesale business fell 12% on a reported basis, while it grew 11% at cc.Asia: The segment’s revenues increased 13% year over year to $378 million on a reported basis and 18% on a currency-neutral basis. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $376 million. Comps in Asia were up 13%, backed by 14% growth in brick-and-mortar stores and an 11% increase in the digital business.Story continuesMarginsRalph Lauren's adjusted gross profit margin expanded 80 bps year over year on a reported basis but the metric expanded 130 bps on a cc basis to 69%. This was mainly driven by solid AUR growth across all regions, favorable channel and geographic mix, and reduced freight, which more than offset continued pressure from raw material costs and adverse currency.Adjusted operating expenses inched up 1% from the year-ago period to $830 million in the fiscal first quarter, driven by higher compensation, and rent &amp; occupancy costs, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 30 bps to 56% in the reported quarter.The company’s adjusted operating income was $200 million, up 5.3% year over year. The adjusted operating margin expanded 70 bps year over year to 13%.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Ralph Lauren Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFinancialsRalph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1,680 million, a total debt of $1,139 million and total shareholders’ equity of $2,441 million.

The directly operated stores included 215 Ralph Lauren and 345 Polo factory stores. The company operated 183 licensed stores globally as of the same date.OutlookManagement has issued its fiscal 2024 guidance based on the ongoing macroeconomic environment, muted consumer spending, inflationary pressures, foreign currency movement and the war in Ukraine.For fiscal 2024, RL anticipates year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits. This includes 20 bps of negative impacts of currency. The gross  margin is forecast to expand 100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR, favorable geographic mix and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation. The metric includes 30 bps of adverse impacts of foreign currency. The fiscal 2024 tax rate is likely to be 23-24%.For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. This includes approximately 100 basis points of positive foreign currency impact.The operating margin is predicted to be 9.5-10% on a reported basis and 9-9.5% in constant currency. The gross margin is expected to expand 40-60 bps, which will more than offset higher operating expenses. The metric is likely to witness 10 bps of adverse currency impacts.

236,acaa1568-c364-3ad7-b823-8ad90a6be6b7,ROST,2023-08-11,Ross Stores (ROST) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-rost-earnings-expected-140011528.html,1691676011,STORY,['ROST'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ross Stores (ROST) reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.6%.Revenues are expected to be $4.72 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ross Stores will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of +2.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ross Stores doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, TJX (TJX) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the quarter ended July 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $12.4 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for TJX has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.63%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MAR) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Marriott International's shares before the 16th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.52 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.08 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Marriott International has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current stock price of $208.39. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Marriott International Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Marriott International paid out just 18% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 22% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's positive to see that Marriott International's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Marriott International's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Marriott International has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineIs Marriott International worth buying for its dividend? Marriott International has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Marriott International looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Marriott International for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Marriott International and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Elsewhere, News Corp sounds off on its generative artificial intelligence plans, while the Supreme Court places a temporary block on OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma's $6 billion bankruptcy settlement.1. Futures mixed ahead of producer price dataU.S. stock futures were mixed Friday, as traders digested cooler-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data and looked ahead to the release of a monthly measure of producer price growth later in the session.By 05:21 ET (09:21 GMT), the Dow futures contract added 32 points or 0.09%, S&amp;P 500 futures were mostly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 19 points or 0.12%.Underpinning sentiment heading into the last day of trading this week was Thursday's U.S. consumer price index, which showed that annual headline inflation in the world's largest economy rose by less than expected in July. On a monthly basis, the reading increased by 0.2% for a second straight month, bolstering projections that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from its long-running campaign of interest rate hikes.More detail will likely be added to the inflation picture today with the publication of the producer price index for last month. Economists estimate that the figure, which gauges the selling prices received by domestic producers, accelerated to 0.7% annually and 0.2% monthly in July. The core number, which removes food and energy, is seen picking up the pace slightly to 0.2% month-on-month, but slowing marginally to 2.3% year-on-year.2. News Corp eyes AIMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) saw revenue fall by almost a tenth in the latest quarter, dragging the owner of the Wall Street Journal and the Sunday Times down to a three-month loss.The decline was mitigated, however, by the company's Dow Jones division. The publisher of Market Watch and Barron's posted segment earnings of $133 million, a jump of 25% and the unit's best profit since joining News Corp.Story continuesMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson outlined the group's wider plans to adjust to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence. Calling it a ""challenge"" to the maintenance of publishers' intellectual property, Thomson said News Corp is in active negotiations to set a value for its content and IP.But Thomson maintained that generative AI still represents a ""remarkable opportunity"" to build fresh revenue sources and slash costs.News Corp shares were little changed in premarket U.S. trading Friday.3. Supreme Court halts Purdue Pharma opioid settlementThe U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the bankruptcy proceedings of Purdue Pharma, casting doubt over whether members of the Sackler family that owns the company can be shielded from any future claims related to the U.S. opioid epidemic.Earlier this year, a lower court approved a deal that would have shielded the Sacklers from potential lawsuits in return for a one-off payment of $6B to victims of the crisis.The Justice Department subsequently asked that the settlement be delayed, claiming that it improperly removes any future liability from third parties for contributing to the crisis. The Supreme Court has now agreed to hear oral arguments in December.Purdue, the maker of opioid painkiller OxyContin, would need the agreement to exit bankruptcy. The company has rebuffed the DoJ's request, arguing that it would take ""billions of dollars"" out of opioid recovery programs and eventually make ""meaningful recovery"" for victims more difficult.4. UBS ends Credit Suisse deal's state backstopUBS (SIX:UBSG) announced on Friday that it no longer needed government backing worth CHF 9B, or just over $10B, that was put in place to protect the Swiss banking giant from losses linked to its takeover of rival Credit Suisse.The rescue had included an agreement from the state to shield UBS from CHF 9B in losses from the arrangement, as long as it guaranteed to take a hit of CHF 5B.UBS also halted a CHF 100B liquidity backstop that was offered by the Swiss National Bank. The aid was first established during a crisis in March that rocked the country's banking sector and eventually led to the state-sponsored tie-up between UBS and Credit Suisse.Following a ""comprehensive assessment"" of Credit Suisse's non-core assets, UBS said it had concluded that it was not necessary to maintain these liquidity support measures. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, fully repaid a CHF 50B emergency loan from the Swiss government first, UBS added.Swiss-listed shares in UBS climbed Friday.5. Crude hovers around flatlineOil prices were choppy Friday, but stayed mostly around the flatline, with traders trying to judge U.S. inflation data, concerns about a stuttering economic recovery in top crude importer China, and optimistic demand forecasts from OPEC.Thursday’s U.S. CPI release saw the dollar strengthening, hurting the crude market as it makes the commodity more expensive for buyers holding foreign currencies.Growing fears over China’s economy also weighed on oil markets, but this was counterbalanced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirming on Thursday that it still expects world oil demand to rise by 2.25 million barrels per day in 2024, compared with the growth of 2.44 million barrels per day this year.By 05:22 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $82.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract dipped 0.5% to $86.01.Related ArticlesPPI ahead, News Corp's AI plans - what's moving marketsChina to replace $140 billion LGFV debt with local bonds - Bloomberg NewsTake Five: Are we there yet?]"

A quarter ago, it was expected that this publishing company whose flagship is The Wall Street Journal would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.09, delivering a surprise of 50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.News Corp. , which belongs to the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry, posted revenues of $2.43 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.67 billion.

251,031b8eb6-e75b-369c-ae68-da4f9ca06df3,SNA,2023-08-11,Investors in Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) have seen favorable returns of 92% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-snap-nyse-sna-seen-135438159.html,1691675678,STORY,['SNA'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. Just take a look at Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), which is up 78%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 26% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 23% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Snap-on While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Snap-on was able to grow its EPS at 21% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This observation indicates that the market's attitude to the business hasn't changed all that much. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Snap-on has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Snap-on the TSR over the last 3 years was 92%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Snap-on shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over one year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Snap-on better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Snap-on   you should know about.Of course Snap-on may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 High-Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $10.Dividend stocks offer advantages beyond just income generation, benefiting both regular investors and those seeking a steady stream of earnings. Dividend equities are added to portfolios for a maximum hedge against inflation due to their consistent cash flow and value growth. Moreover, dividend stocks outperformed non-dividend stocks historically, as shown by S&amp;P 500 data between 1973 and 2022, where dividend stocks provided double the returns of non-payers.Dividends also offer flexibility as investors can choose to receive them as cash or reinvest them. When reinvesting dividends, the power of compounding boosts profits significantly. Over the last century, dividends have made up roughly 41% of the S&amp;P 500's overall gains. While the numbers may appear appealing, making profits from dividend stocks can be a bit challenging. It's wiser to choose quality companies with a strong history of increasing dividends rather than focusing solely on high yields. Dividend yield refers to the ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends annually in relation to its stock price. High dividend yields can sometimes be a red flag for investors because they might indicate potential issues with a company such as unsustainable dividends, market perception, and limited growth potential.  It could also suggest that the company is paying out a large portion of its earnings as dividends, leaving less for reinvestment in growth or other financial needs.Also read: Dividend Growth Stocks: 25 AristocratsThat said, not all high-yield dividend stocks are the same. In certain industries like utilities and real estate, higher yields are normal and healthy due to their business models. Investors need to consider a company's business approach and the sustainability of its dividends when making investment decisions. Some companies with higher-than-average yields, such as Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS), have strong histories of paying dividends and solid financial standings.

(“Verizon”) received notice of a “mini-tender” offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation (“TRC Capital”) and recommends that its stockholders reject the unsolicited offer. Pursuant to the offer, which is dated August 2, 2023, TRC Capital is offering to purchase up to 3 million shares of Verizon common stock at $31.95 per share (the “Offer Price”). The Offer Price is approximately 4.43% lower than the closing price of Verizon common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 1, 2023, the last trading day prior to the date of the offer. Verizon is not associated with TRC Capital or its “mini-tender” offer.According to guidance on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) website, mini-tender offers “have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard” and investors “may end up selling their securities at below-market prices.” Verizon stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a price below the current market price of Verizon common stock.Mini-tender offers seek less than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding shares. This lets the offering company avoid many disclosure and procedural requirements that the SEC requires for tender offers.Verizon urges investors to obtain current market quotes for their shares of common stock, consult with their financial advisors and exercise caution with TRC Capital’s offer. Stockholders who already tendered their shares may withdraw them by providing the written notice described in the TRC Capital offering documents before the expiration of the offer and at other times described in the offering.Verizon requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to TRC Capital’s offer for shares of Verizon common stock.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services.

This means Capri's brands — Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors — will join Tapestry's existing luxury brand portfolio, which consists of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman.The mega dollars spent in this deal aim to expand the US-based fashion company's global reach, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said on a conference call. The merger is expected to close in 2024.But Tapestry bringing on more brands of a similar caliber received a mixed reaction from Wall Street. Tapestry stock plunged nearly 16% as of the market close on Thursday while shares of Capri Holdings skyrocketed 55%.According to one industry veteran, the deal may not be a smart move on the part of Tapestry.""When I think of the six brands that are in the combined Capri-Tapestry, there is not one that I would define as a power brand,"" Pauline Brown, former LVMH Chairman of North America and author of ""Aesthetic Intelligence,"" told Yahoo Finance. ""It's a little bit like if you have two boats, and both boats are floating, but they each have a little bit of a leak. You put them together, [and] it doesn't make the two boats — now sort of connected — any more robust on the high seas.""On the price tag of the deal, Brown added that Tapestry paid ""a healthy multiple on a company that I just don't think was that healthy.""Tapestry looks overseas to scaleFor others on the Street, however, the deal made a lot of sense.In an interview with Yahoo Finance last fall, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat broke down the company's three-year growth strategy, called ""Future Speed."" One of the four pillars embarked on ""powering global growth.""""We've proven to have the ability and the agility to move with the customers,"" Crevoiserat said at the time. ""The consumer is moving fast, and we've engineered our organization to be able to respond to those changes and be closer to that consumer.""Story continuesThe Capri merger seems to further that strategy.BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) that the announcement was ""an interesting diversification.""""It's an attempt now at expanding the scale and creating a version of ... the same European powerhouses [in the US],"" he added, similar to Kering and LVMH.Greg Portell, a lead partner at Kearney Global Markets, also expressed confidence in the deal. Portell noted that ""scale matters in retail"" and ""retailers have realized that a portfolio of brands expands those points of connection with consumers.""Back in 2017, Coach changed its name to Tapestry after it acquired both Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade. Portell stated this deal goes further in providing ""a clear platform for growth"" while scaling Tapestry's business too.""The challenge for multi-brand companies — retail or consumer product goods — is to maintain brand identity and creative integrity while still getting the efficiency of scale in the back office,"" Portell said. ""Tapestry has a track record of making that work which gives confidence in the acquisition thesis.""Handbags are pictured through a window of a Coach store in Pasadena, California, January 26, 2015.

Well, big name retailers, including Walmart and Target, gearing up to report their quarterly results next week, and it certainly is a tricky year for retailers as they navigate what is becoming a more cautious consumer. So what names should you buy, and what should you sell? We want to bring in James Demmert. He's Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer, along with Brian Mulberry, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager. Great to have both of you.Brian, let me start with you. We talk about the fact that it's a tough environment here for retailers. More and more consumers-- we've seen this trend over the last couple of quarters. More consumers starting to trade down. Walmart is one of your picks. What gives Walmart the edge in this environment?Story continuesBRIAN MULBERRY: As you guys have been talking about, inflation has been a big impact on bottom lines across the board. Just simply the cost of doing business, labor and supply chain issues have made things difficult for a lot of these retailers. But Walmart has been a cash flow generating machine. And the more cash flow that you have, that you can reinvest in your own business without having to leverage right now is going to be a key difference as we go forward.I agree with a lot of the other comments made earlier today in that interest rates are likely just to stay higher for longer than the equity markets currently have priced in. Not that we have a huge disagreement about we might be at the top terminal rate or one more hike to go, but we don't see the rate cuts in the future. That just simply means the cost of doing business in the future continues to stay high.So these companies like Walmart, that continue to generate an enormous amount of cash flow, have that capital to reinvest in themselves organically and grow. And they've done so. They've made huge investments in their e-commerce segment, primarily to combat what they have in terms of direct competition with Amazon. And they're gearing up their home delivery services. And so they're using that cash flow to their advantage in this highly competitive sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So, James, let's pick up on that point. I mean, you know, Brian, looking essentially where consumers are going right now, especially with tighter wallets, talking about cash flow investments in e-commerce, is this a name that you would get in on? How are you looking at the retail space?JAMES DEMMERT: It is a name that we find attractive without question. And one of the few rules that we have, particularly in what I consider a stock picker's market, is the three most important things in retail which is brand management, brand itself, management, and as Brian mentioned, indebtedness.It's very important here that companies have very strong balance sheets and that brand awareness and really, really great management. And I think that's going to be a key issue as we go through the hurdles of stickier inflation and quite some time before the Fed cuts. So we've got a couple names beyond the Walmart that we find very attractive here.SEANA SMITH: And what are those, James?JAMES DEMMERT: The first is, back to our global style, a company like LVMH. Obviously, lifestyles of the rich and famous type of stock. But there again, the one-percenters tend to be pretty consistent through all kinds of economic climates. When we go back to our brand is important, these are probably some of the highest end brands in the world and well known and recognizable. Arnault is probably one of the best managers of a business, and we do buy businesses.And again, debt levels are important. So we want to make sure the company isn't over its skis, let's say, in indebtedness. So really the right mix. And here, you have the stock down about 8% from its high. Really love that as an opportunity to add to the position. Or if investors don't own it, here's a great time to do so.AKIKO FUJITA: James, really quickly. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the announcement that we got today of Capri and Tapestry because we were talking earlier about as much as those companies combined bring in brands under one umbrella, it's still tough to compete with a name like LVMH, which you're invested in.JAMES DEMMERT: I think it is. That's a very good question. And Etsy sort of falls into that same trap, where you've just got too many-- you don't have any brands of significance. You've just got a lot of brands. And I think that's going to be the differentiator for the successful companies over the next 12 months versus the others. So again, I would want to stick again with brand awareness, like a Tractor Supply, which we can talk about as well, has got that very significant presence, as in brand awareness. Really, really important.SEANA SMITH: All right, James, we'll talk about Tractor Supply in just a minute. But Brian, I want to get your thoughts here just on the luxury consumer given the fact that it sounds like you see a lot of the opportunity being at the other end of the market, the lower income market.BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, and it's certainly that we don't acknowledge the luxury brand. There has been a lot of durability there in spending from consumers. And we think a lot of that has to do with the fact most of those higher end, higher income individuals were able to take advantage of the low in the rate hike-- in the rate cycle and refinance usually what is their biggest debt, which is their mortgage. And that has cleaned up their balance sheet. And so their spending has been growing even more so than what you would see in the low to mid-income range.So there's absolutely a reason to have those types of companies in your portfolio. We think it absolutely makes a lot of sense. It doesn't mean that we don't like them. It just means that at this point, we're a touch more defensive, leaning a little bit more on free cash flow and operating income. And there's definitely going to be some consolidation, we think, in those brands that James was just talking about.AKIKO FUJITA: With that said, Brian, we started the conversation by talking about Walmart. There's another name that you actually surprisingly don't like, a direct competitor to Walmart. What's different here when you look at a name like Walmart versus Target?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Target really over the last couple of years has had a difficult time managing their inventory. And they now have a new problem where they just acknowledge that they have $500 million worth of shrink or theft coming out of the stores, and a lot of it is because they have so much on clearance and on sale that's really impacted their margins for a very long time coming out of COVID.And this affected a lot of people trying to get their actual goods landed in stores. And it had a ripple effect when you had a whole bunch of nonseasonable wares in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so they made a decision to try and clear out that inventory and not have to wait on it, but it has impacted their margins to a point where there's a little bit of a capitulation in confidence in the company, and that's starting to get reflected in their margins going forward as well.And so it's not that target is a bad company, they're just kind of stuck in a bad spiral, and they're really going to have to work hard to get out of that. Again, this puts pressure directly on those metrics that we like. Operating income, free cash flow, they've all been in pretty substantial decline over the last three or four quarters. And we don't see it improving until maybe three years from now that they can work themselves out of this particular hole.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Target shares off just about 12% so far this year. James, getting back to what you just said a moment ago, and that's Tractor Supply. You talked about the brand awareness, but this is also a stock that hasn't done much since the start of the year. What's the bull case here for Tractor Supply?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah. It's a stock like many of the stocks outside of the Super Seven tech that has gone a long way this year. And I think that the valuation should be the first thing that's attractive, right? PE, multiple versus growth. Then back to brand awareness. This is the leader in gardening, and even farm equipment, and all kinds of stuff that you'd like to do in the garden.And so one of the things and themes outside of brand awareness, which of course, they're the kingpin, is this incredible move by millennials to the outer parts, the more rural parts of the country and not just here in the United States. So Tractor Supply started in 1938. I mean, they are the brand. They're continuing to open new stores. So you have that expansion growth story.You've got brand awareness, as we talked about before. And wow, do they have high margins and extremely well managed business, as opposed to what Brian mentioned, the Target situation, which is sort of a mismanagement there. On the Tractor Supply, you've got excellent management, great valuation, and you've got that millennial push. They're opening stores. All the right mix of a company that yes, maybe hasn't done tremendously well so far this year but probably will in the back half of this year into 2024.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Brian, let's end on a positive note, sort of staying in the home improvement space. Home Depot, one of those stocks that you say you like. We've seen a bit of a transition in terms of what is driving revenue for Home Depot. We kind of went through the pandemic where there was this huge, huge push in DIY. Since then, it's kind of moved in a different direction. What are you liking what the company is doing right now?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Again, a lot of investments in where future revenue is going to come from at Home Depot. They moved away from that DIY segment and put a lot into their pro development. And these are the licensed contractors, the actual professionals that can come in and do projects for you. And that's been a big transition in their business. The last 20 years, they've been the DIY kings along with Lowe's. But now they've actually made substantial investments in where they see the future of revenue coming from.And there's a bit of a cycle in the consumer here where they absolutely did home improvements on their own. And then the value of their home went up so substantially, they started to sell it and trade up. And now it's coming back around to where people are going to want to have some projects and some improvements done. and Home Depot has by far and away made great investments in being ahead of that curve, so that they can supply the contractors with everything that they need to get those jobs done.And that's important right now because the contractors are making more money now than they ever have been because of the short supply of their skill set and skilled labor. And so being able to have a trusted partner where you can actually work very conveniently with your own personal representative online again in an e-commerce way, go pick up the materials that you need, it makes you more efficient. It makes you able to do more projects that's better for your bottom line and Home Depot. That's why we like them.AKIKO FUJITA: You've given us a lot to think about in the retail space both of you, James Demmert and Brian Mulberry. Good to talk to both of you. Really appreciate the time.]"

Capri Holdings shares rose on news of the deal. Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at the deal and its impact on both companies.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tapestry reaching a big deal here to buy Capri Holdings for $8.5 billion. We're seeing a massive reaction in Capri stock, up just about 55% right now, while the fashion giant saying that this is going to help expand their global reach. The transaction will see Tapestry, which is the owner of Coach, Stuart Weitzman, and Kate Spade gain control of Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo.And, Akiko, when we take a look at what's been happening within the retail space, specifically within the luxury space, we have seen this pattern of consolidation. We know they are up against some stiff competition. LVMH has long-- has been viewed, I think, fair to say in recent years as the winner, as the leader, I should say, within this space. How much is this materially going to change, though, Tapestry's business going forward? I think a lot of people are starting to question that just given the brands that they have under this umbrella and how much it still resonates or how little maybe it's resonating with consumers these days.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Seana, that's something we were talking about this morning, right? I mean, if you look at the portfolio of brands that are under Tapestry and Capri Holdings versus LVMH, it still, still pales in comparison to what LVMH has. Having said that, it is interesting timing in all of this. When you think about consumers increasingly pulling back on discretionary spending, what would the announcement today allows these two big retail names, American names, we should say, really, to pull resources together in a big way?A number of things the companies have announced, that the two groups combined generate $12 billion in revenue. The merger will result in $200 million in savings. We're talking about in operations as well as supply chain costs over the course of 3 years. And then this really does increase the opportunity in terms of direct-to-consumer opportunities for these brands.Story continuesSo strategically, it makes sense. You know, if the question is, does this allow them to compete with the likes of LVMH in a big way, it feels like there's still a ways off.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it feels like they are very far ways off. And it also took the street by surprise-- a little bit by surprise. We're getting some analysts reaction today. BMO Capital Markets Simeon Siegel, he was out saying that this deal was a surprise. He does view it as a positive for Capri shareholders. Remember, this is a stock that was off just about 40% so far this year ahead of this deal.But he was saying it's a little bit surprising given the similarity, the brand similarity-- Akiko, you just mentioned two US American brands here-- and also, the momentum, the current strategy, potential execution issues, which could arise and likely to arise with the combination of these two well-known names. So I think the future of it and also just given the timing like you were saying with consumers thinking twice before spending on discretionary products makes some people just second-guess, I guess, what exactly the catalyst will be for these two names in the short-term.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, having said that, when you combine these two forces, it does mean something for the brand. If you look at Capri Holdings, for example, they get more exposure to the Asian markets.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.AKIKO FUJITA: You look at somebody like Tapestry, more exposure to EMEA. So we'll still have to see some of those brands, you know, their footprints expand and see how consumers respond. But yes, to your point, you know, luxury brands, just like a lot of brands, certainly going to get hit because consumers are becoming increasingly conservative with their wallets. That space is certainly going to take a hit as a result of that.]"

On Thursday, it dished out $8.5 billion to buy Capri, the owner of fashion brands Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo.The goal is to create “a new powerful global luxury house,” Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said in a statement. Experts say the acquisition is an effort to mitigate the effects of slowed consumer spending amid inflation and rising interest rates.Today’s mega-merger is still dwarfed by the sector’s largest-ever deal. In October 2020, LVMH purchased the iconic jewelry company Tiffany &amp; Co. for nearly $16 billion.LVMH is a French luxury group formed from the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton, champagne and spirits company Moët &amp; Chandon, and cognac manufacturer Hennessy. The company owns 75 brands across six sectors, including fashion houses Christian Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Fendi, and Stella McCartney; jewelry company Bulgari; cosmetics retailer Sephora; as well as vodka distillery Belvedere; and champagne winery Dom Pérignon.The company boasts a $462 billion market cap, and the man behind the curtain is French business magnate Arnault.The (second) richest man in the worldArnault, 74, became chairman and CEO of LVMH in 1989 after spending $2.6 billion buying up a stake in order to become the company’s largest shareholder and oust the former chief executive, Henry Racamier.Arnault has a net worth of $226.2 billion, according to Forbes, and his wealth is largely tied to LVMH shares, including a 97.5% stake in Dior. He and tech tycoon Musk have been vying to be the world’s richest person for over a year now.Story continuesMusk moved up to No. 1 in June with a net worth of $228.8 billion, bumping Arnault down to No. 2 after holding the title for five months, according to Forbes.But the French billionaire is doing just fine. LVMH announced at the end of July it would become a premium sponsor of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, committing €150 million, or $166 million, to the Olympic and Paralympic games, Bloomberg reported.Recovering from the popped luxury retail bubbleWith inflation and rising interest rates, American consumer spending has slowed significantly from the buying craze of the pandemic years. From 2020 to 2022, low interest rates boosted consumer spending, creating an “everything bubble.” The luxury retail market was one of many to explode.Now, shoppers’ appetite for discretionary items like electronics, furniture, and apparel has diminished, and luxury brands are feeling the effects.European luxury stocks fell $32.3 billion in May as investors anticipated the impact of a softening U.S. economy. LVMH shares lost over $50 billion shortly after reaching a record-breaking $500 billion market cap. (This downturn is in part why Musk surpassed Arnault as the wealthiest person in the world.)Tapestry’s acquisition of Capri is a move to both wield greater influence in the European-dominated market and mitigate the effects of the spending slump.“Luxury is facing something of a slowdown, especially in the North American market, where consumers, even at the higher-income end, are starting to curtail spending,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, told the Associated Press. “This has put pressure on Tapestry and Capri, both of which are now looking to international markets to bolster growth.”The Tapestry and Capri acquisition is expected to close next year. Both boards have approved the deal, but it still awaits approval from Capri shareholders, who will receive $57 per share in cash, a nearly 65% premium from its closing price of $34.61 on Wednesday.Tapestry, founded in 1941, has a market cap of $8.2 billion. Capri has a market cap of $6.3 billion. The two companies generated a combined $12 billion in global sales and a nearly $2 billion adjusted operating profit in the 2022 fiscal year, according to a release.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The company intends to follow up patients in the study for 24 months following completion of the enrollment. It expects to file primary data from the study to support a Premarket Approval application to the FDA after six months.Price PerformanceShares of Merit Medical have lost 1.8% year to date against the industry’s growth of 16.4%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 18.5% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSignificance of the StudyThe WAVE study is comparing WRAPSODY to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as a potential treatment for stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion (blockage) of blood vessels in the venous outflow circuit in patients undergoing hemodialysis.A long-term vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis is achieved with the creation and maintenance of AVF/AVG in blood vessels. However, stenosis/occlusion in the blood vessel used for AVF/AVG can prevent delivery of hemodialysis that may lead to life-threatening consequences. The WRAPSODY device is being developed to help physicians treat patients with stenosis/occlusion.The currently available treatment options to maintain vascular access in hemodialysis patients have inadequate response. WRAPSODY, on the other hand, has the potential to provide better maintenance of AVF/AVG due to its unique cell-impermeable stent covering.The WRAPSODY device has already achieved CE-mark in Europe and is also available in Brazil. While the device is not available commercially in the United States, it is being used in the country under an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global dialysis market was valued at $91,205.0 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $129,756.8 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 4.7%. Factors like an increase in number of diabetic and hypertension patients, a rise in the number of end-stage renal disease patients and a preference over kidney transplantation are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the successful development of WRAPSODY is expected to provide a significant boost to Merit Medical’s business in the niche space.Notable DevelopmentsIn July, Merit Medical announced second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an encouraging year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company witnessed revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories in its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also recorded. Expansion of gross margin buoys optimism.In June, MMSI completed the acquisition of a portfolio of dialysis catheter products and the BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System from AngioDynamics. Management believes that these acquisitions will likely strengthen its position in the dialysis and biopsy markets, besides expanding its specialty dialysis device offering.In March, the company announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.

High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.Travelers’ commercial businesses continue to perform well on the back of stability in the markets where it operates as well as the execution of its strategies. For 2023, the insurer expects renewal premium change to be modestly at a higher level throughout the remainder of 2023. In domestic homeowners and other, TRV expects renewal premium change to remain at an elevated level through the end of the year.Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive the metric higher. Given improved rate environment, Travelers raised outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million for the second half of the year, to an estimated $570 million in the third quarter and then to around $590 million in the fourth quarter.TRV maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. TRV aims to generate increased earnings and capital, maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy. Balance sheet strength driven by scale, profitability and cash flow support it to invest more than $1 billion annually on technology.The property &amp; casualty insurer returned $633 million of capital to shareholders in the second quarter, consisting share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years.

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.5% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Fox Fox's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Fox's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 49.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendFox Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryThe dividend hasn't seen any major cuts in the past, but the company has only been paying a dividend for 4 years, which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. Since 2019, the dividend has gone from $0.46 total annually to $0.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.1% over that duration. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 7.0% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Fox will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Fox that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

An In-Depth Valuation AnalysisUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Considering these factors, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) appears to be modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesIs Fox Corp (FOXA) Modestly Undervalued?

281,71d98765-d669-3830-9a80-cbebfb116aa4,CHRW,2023-08-11,The Returns At C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-c-h-robinson-worldwide-142940548.html,1691677780,STORY,['CHRW'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for C.H. Robinson Worldwide, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$800m ÷ (US$5.4b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, C.H. Robinson Worldwide has an ROCE of 30%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide roceIn the above chart we have measured C.H. Robinson Worldwide's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering C.H. Robinson Worldwide here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThings have been pretty stable at C.H. Robinson Worldwide, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So while the current operations are delivering respectable returns, unless capital employed increases we'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why C.H. Robinson Worldwide is paying out 50% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesAnother point to note, we noticed the company has increased current liabilities over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 51% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than30% because total capital employed would be higher.The 30% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 51% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. Additionally, this high level of current liabilities isn't ideal because it means the company's suppliers (or short-term creditors) are effectively funding a large portion of the business.The Bottom Line On C.H. Robinson Worldwide's ROCEIn summary, C.H. Robinson Worldwide isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 16% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for C.H. Robinson Worldwide  that we think you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

And Iger says he already has a secret recipe for success.Investors may have missed this revelation during Disney’s fiscal Q3 earnings call Wednesday, with much of the attention focused on the Disney+ price hikes and Iger’s comments about cracking down on password sharing.Iger laid out a series of steps Disney is taking to make its direct-to-consumer, or streaming, business profitable and more successful. They include rethinking how many original titles Disney makes, rolling out new technology to improve the user experience, and ramping up advertising efforts.The plan also includes unifying Disney's various streaming properties in the U.S. into a ""one-app experience."" And for that, Iger said, Disney already has a blueprint: “It's a formula for success,"" Iger said, ""that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+.""The Star offering?If you live in the U.S. the name probably doesn’t mean much. Star is Disney’s replacement for Hulu outside the U.S., and it hasn’t often been a topic of conversation in earnings calls.A television broadcaster in China and India that Disney inherited with its 2019 purchase of 21st Century Fox, Star became a pillar of Disney's streaming empire almost by accident. When then-CEO Bob Chapek decided that Hulu didn’t have a recognizable brand outside the U.S., the company turned to Star, making it the general entertainment section of the Disney+ interface in international markets.Disney rolled out Star in waves beginning in 2021, and it's now available in more than 70 countries. It hosts content from Disney properties, including ABC, FX and Freeform, as well as some third party content depending on the country.The marriage of Star and Disney+ embodies Iger's vision of pairing general entertainment content (the television-style programming of Star) with Disney's acclaimed brands and franchises (Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and of course, classic Walt Disney fare). For users in most international markets, this was a forced marriage. The addition of Star to Disney+ was not optional, and it came with a price increase. In Europe, users went from paying €6.99 ($7.70) per month to €8.99 ($9.90) per month when Star launched.Story continuesDisney doesn’t disclose Star statistics, so it is unclear how many users actually watch content on the service. But it doesn’t seem to have dissuaded users. The company’s international Disney+ offering, which now has 59.7 million users, has never seen a quarter-over-quarter dip in subscribers in the two years since it started reporting the count. Disney's domestic streaming business, on the other hand, has shed subscribers twice.Disney’s international offering has also had a higher growth rate than its domestic one. In the U.S., Disney+ subscribers are up 7% from the start of 2022. Internationally, the count is up 45%. It is yet to be shown if the launch of Star caused the growth, but it clearly didn’t result in a decline.The Star integration on Disney+ represents what a lot of industry experts are calling the future—the ability to watch multiple streaming services on one platform. According to a 2022 Nielsen report, 64% of consumers want more bundling options. Disney recently announced it will create a single app offering both Disney+ and Hulu for users who purchased the bundle, which looks a lot like what Disney did with Star two years ago.The Star model could also hint at what Iger has in mind for ESPN, the Disney-owned sports network. During Wednesday's call, Iger said the company was exploring various ways to remake ESPN into a stronger player in the streaming market, with potential distribution and content partnerships. If Iger follows the Star playbook for ESPN, that could mean pairing the network's top-tier sports programming with some type of complimentary content.Having streaming content in one online location will result in “higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers,” Iger said on Wednesday’s call. In other words, it will make Iger's Disney a streaming star.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This comes as theme park competitor Disney's (DIS) CEO Bob Iger addressed ""softer"" demand than what was expected in the entertainment company's theme park segment. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Brooke DiPalma, and Pras Subramanian take a temperature check of the travel bookings for theme parks.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: And guys, I have my eye on the amusement parks today and specifically that overall space. Looking at Six Flags earnings coming out this morning, I think the stock closed down about 5%, as they didn't quite meet Street expectations. As you can see there, revenue coming in at $443 million. The Street has been looking for $457 million. And then adjusted EPS also coming in a bit under what Wall Street had expected.Interesting though, revenues still up from last year. Attendance still up from last year. But sort of an interesting overall dynamic playing out with parks. And then you think about what Bob Iger said on Disney's earnings call last night about parks. And I want to play a bite for you guys of what Iger had to say last night.BOB IGER: We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also, as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state.JOSH SCHAFER: Pras, this just stuck out to me because it's something we've talked about when we were talking about the lowering attendance numbers we had seen at Disney, right? And Disney didn't fully address it. Iger obviously addressing it there last night. And you just wonder, is all of that coming back? Is the visitation going to fully come back? Or did we sort of hit that COVID peak, and now we're kind of past COVID peak demand? And maybe the revenge travel is just going away a little bit?Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I think it's definitely-- that's definitely a big piece of it. You know, we spoke about how higher temperatures in Florida may be affecting tenants, but then you had heard Bob Iger talking about the anniversary last year. That was a big year for them. It's going to naturally curtail up. But also, they are seeing some weakness there.With Six Flags, in particular, I was reading about how, you mentioned, revenue up, but spend down. They're seeing a lot of their flash pass or their season pass users come in, not the people that are spending on day passes. So that's hurting them. It's seeing a more cost conscious consumer coming in to still want to go out but not spend a lot of money. And I think this is part of that post-pandemic revenge travel, revenge fun, whatever you want to call it, going back a bit. And people were saying, hey, I need to spend a little less money.BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Consumers certainly pulling back here, especially on these sort of extravagant adventures that they were going on post-COVID and attendance coming in, you know, increase year-over-year, but coming in short of expectations there.And really, what we're seeing across the board is, I'll be honest, I didn't realize how expensive these tickets were. For Six Flags, it's like $35 to $70. For a standard theme day park pass at Disney $109 to $189. I mean, for a family of four, you're talking upwards of $500. That's not something that the everyday American necessarily put out and do as we're continuing to see this value conscious consumer here in the US.And also, as you mentioned, Six Flags saying that they had a challenging weather environment in the second quarter with unusually high rainfall. But it's, you know, how much can you blame the weather on, you know, I've been to the park in the wet weather. I'll be honest. And so, you know, it's definitely a challenging environment overall.JOSH SCHAFER: You do wonder with the heat, though, too, specifically what they were saying in Florida. That stands out to me, because I don't think it's going anywhere. And in the long run, if we continue to keep having hotter and hotter summers, how do you sort of counteract that when you are an amusement park? Because personally, if it's 100 degrees--BROOKE DIPALMA: I'm not going.JOSH SCHAFER: I'm not going.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Maybe the water park, but I'm not going on an actual roller coaster--BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Blizzard Beach might be seeing an increase in attendance, but not the Magic Kingdom.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Exactly. I mean, maybe you cut prices for-- I mean, I know they do have dynamic pricing, but maybe you cut even more. That's probably not where they want to go.]"

Yeti (YETI) stock is up about 17 percent as the company's second-quarter earnings beat on the bottom line. Disney (DIS) shares rise as the company announced it will be increasing the prices of its streaming services and cracking down on password sharing. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video Transcript- All right. Let's take a look at some of the individual movers of the day. First up, Alibaba closing the trading session higher. We're still looking at a gain of just about 4.5% revenue. Topping expectations as its core e-commerce division returned to growth for the first time in a year.And Akiko, when we talk about the Chinese market, the recovery, lack thereof, that we're seeing this, I think this stronger than expected report caught a lot of analysts off guard and the degree that they were able to beat some of these expectations, the magnitude of that beat. But e-commerce unit focusing on the lower cost items to attract more buyers. And at least for right now, looks like that strategy from Alibaba is working.- Yeah. The backdrop of this quarter certainly adding to the enthusiasm we're seeing from investors and the numbers that came through from Alibaba. To your point, the company able to return in growth in this way at a time when we have seen growth pull back when you look at the overall economy over in China.What's going to be interesting to me though is how investors continue to value this company as they spin off those assets. Of course, Alibaba about to break off into six different pillars here because of that crackdown that we have seen over in China. So they are seeing a big bump today, but it's going to be interesting to see where that stock is valued increasingly as we see that transformation for Alibaba.Well, shares of Yeti closing the day higher after reporting mixed earnings for the second quarter, topping expectations on the bottom line. The company raising the lower end of their full year adjusted net sales outlook and increased their 2023 adjusted EPS outlook. That stock up more than 17% today, Seana.Story continues- Yeah. Certainly raising a lot of excitement around this report. And just to give you a better idea of how excited some of these analysts were, Jefferies was out with a note this morning saying that the second quarter shows fundamentals have bottomed, and they're saying buy shares right now. They were very encouraged by these results, raising their price target to $60 this year. Reiterating their buy rating. So $60 this year, about $14 higher from where Yeti closed today.Gross margin expansion inventories were also down big. They were declining about 34% on a year over year basis. So Jefferies saying that Yeti is well positioned to tap into some of that growth. And also, they see Yeti maintaining some of that healthy cash flow ahead.When it comes to some of the other reaction that we got from the streets, city, saying it was a solid second quarter. Baird encouraged by the balance sheet. So Wall Street, very satisfied with these results. Whether or not this momentum continues, given the fact that it's obviously a consumer facing brand and consumers pulling back on their spending, it could potentially be a rough couple of months for Yeti.All right. Let's take a look at Disney, the top performer by far in the Dow today, closing in the green, up nearly 5% after announcing subscription prices are going to be rising for its streaming services. This coming as CEO Bob Iger also said that the company is going to address password-sharing, potentially cracking down on that.Initially, I mean, it was a mixed report, and we did see mixed reaction right after these results. But some of the developments, like the price increases that came on the call. Also more of a focus, Akiko, on the narrower than expected losses in the streaming side of its business. Certainly reasons for the street and for investors to be encouraged about Disney and the potential direction here going forward.- Yeah. $512 billion loss is what we're talking about in terms of the streaming operation. You think about where that is from the point of launch for Disney Plus back in 2019. $11 billion loss or more than $11 billion. So Disney obviously making these efforts to really cut costs that's been a big priority for them. So the street liking at least the company not only increasing the subscription but also cracking down on password-sharing. And you could argue Netflix kind of did the dirty work, right? They were able to push this forward. They have had success. Now Disney Plus following. We'll see where that goes moving forward.- Yeah. We'll see whether or not they see sort of a negative reaction in terms of the churn and subscribers maybe cutting some of their subscriptions. But again, if they're raising the average revenue per user, then it's a win, at least in Disney's eyes.]"

The grant award, made possible by the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), will support the launch of a new Chicago building performance Hub, a collaboration by ComEd, Elevate, Illinois Green Alliance and state and local partners to advance more sustainable building practices across Illinois.The building performance Hub will provide advisory services to building owners and contractors, supporting them on compliance with advanced energy codes and building policies, such as building electrification. ComEd will serve as a technical advisor on the project, investing $500,000 to stand up programs over the next three years.""The DOE grant award reinforces the already strong collaboration between ComEd and our partners across the region who are committed to lowering harmful greenhouse gas emissions across our communities,"" said Gil C. Quiniones, CEO of ComEd. ""This work is critical to the clean energy transition in northern Illinois and throughout the state, and the new Building Performance Hub will play a key role in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and creating a cleaner future for all.""As Illinois communities work to lower carbon emissions, the Hub will play a key role in supporting compliance with current and future building efficiency and electrification codes and requirements. Through the Hub, building owners and developers can leverage a network of support and resources, with training and advisory services available to help make meeting advanced decarbonization goals more cost-effective. The Hub will provide training on new electrification measures, such as heat pumps, and will connect diverse contractors to a pipeline of building projects.Story continues""We want to make the benefits of the clean energy economy accessible to everyone, and that’s really what the Hub is going to focus on,"" said Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate. ""Right now there’s an unprecedented amount of climate standards and funding available – we need to make sure people have the support they need to access these opportunities.""Also through the Hub, building stakeholders can access support on effectively leveraging available resources, such as layering utility energy efficiency incentives with the Inflation Reduction Act’s record level of funding to support building electrification.""The Hub will reach a diverse cross-section of building professionals in Illinois with the education and training to make improving building performance easy and cost effective,"" said Brian Imus, Executive Director of Illinois Green. ""The focus is on technical and actionable resources that will ensure our region can meet aggressive climate action goals within the building sector while building an inclusive green economy.""The grant was made available by the IIJA, the bipartisan federal infrastructure plan dedicated to boosting resilient infrastructure and supporting and equitable clean energy transition in America. The new Building Performance Hub received funding as part of a $90 million competitive grant opportunity by the DOE to help communities implement updated energy codes for buildings, with a goal of lowering both greenhouse gas emissions and the cost of energy bills for customers across the country.Today, buildings account for nearly 74 percent of US electricity consumption, and a third of greenhouse gas emissions nationally. Efforts to lower carbon emissions and transition to more energy efficient technologies are a hallmark of the state's landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which calls for a significant reduction in carbon emissions by 2050; as well as the City of Chicago’s Climate Action Plan, which calls for residential decarbonization targets and updated building codes guiding new construction.""Buildings represent the largest source of Chicago's GHG emissions and Mayor Johnson is committed to equitably transitioning our buildings to a cleaner, healthier future,"" said Angela Tovar, the City of Chicago's Chief Sustainability Officer. ""We can only achieve the ambitious goals of our Climate Action Plan through exciting partnerships like this Building Performance Hub. Equitable decarbonization means connecting Chicagoans to financial and technical resources that provide support at every step along the way.""New investments in a building performance Hub build on ComEd’s ongoing work to help customers lower reliance on fossil fuels through the use of more efficient energy technologies. In addition to the award-winning energy efficiency programs, which have helped families and businesses in our communities save more than $8 billion on their energy bills since 2008, ComEd is supporting customers in the move toward electrification. A new partnership with Elevate and other partners in the region is also working to convert low-income homes to energy-saving, all-electric heating and cooling systems and appliances. The program is already demonstrating how customers can save on home electrification, with potentially hundreds of dollars saved annually on overall energy bills, while significantly lowering energy usage.""The Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, designated the Illinois Finance Authority as the Climate Bank and made it our mission to accelerate the investment of private capital into clean energy projects in a way that reflects the geographic, racial, ethnic, and income-level diversity of Illinois,"" said Chris Meister, Illinois Finance Authority/Climate Bank Executive Director, ""As the Climate Bank, we are intensely focused on obtaining and deploying federal funds to meet our CEJA mission and the Hub will help our State do so. We thank Governor Pritzker for helping the Climate Bank participate as a necessary financial partner in the Hub which will help fill financial and knowledge gaps for disadvantaged businesses who wish to participate in the Illinois clean energy economy.""Additionally, ComEd is removing barriers to electric vehicles (EVs) and other electric technologies. A recently finalized $231 million investment will expand transportation and residential electrification programs for customers through 2025, with a focus on removing barriers to EVs, fleet electrification and creating a network of charging stations. To help customers unlock the benefits of clean transportation, ComEd offers customers an EV Toolkit, a one-stop-shop with information about the savings, benefits and incentives associated with switching to an EV.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

(NYSE:HP) For Its Upcoming Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-considering-helmerich-payne-inc-100608703.html,1691748368,STORY,['HP'],"[Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Helmerich &amp; Payne's shares before the 16th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.71 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Helmerich &amp; Payne has a trailing yield of approximately 4.0% on its current stock price of $42.75. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Helmerich &amp; Payne can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Helmerich &amp; Payne's payout ratio is modest, at just 26% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Helmerich &amp; Payne generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 48% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Helmerich &amp; Payne's 5.0% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Helmerich &amp; Payne has lifted its dividend by approximately 20% a year on average.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Helmerich &amp; Payne for the upcoming dividend? Helmerich &amp; Payne has comfortably low cash and profit payout ratios, which may mean the dividend is sustainable even in the face of a sharp decline in earnings per share. Still, we consider declining earnings to be a warning sign. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Helmerich &amp; Payne from a dividend perspective.Curious what other investors think of Helmerich &amp; Payne? See what analysts are forecasting, with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Factory gate prices also extended declines in July in the No. 2 economy, raising concerns about fuel demand in a country that also happens to be the world's biggest oil buyer.“After an impressive couple of days of gains, crude prices are softening as energy traders await to see what happens with some of the supply side risks,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.OPEC, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, released an August outlook that was almost picture-perfect for the oil bull — projecting a rosy demand outlook through 2024 and super tight immediate supplies thanks to Saudi production cuts.OPEC raised its 2024 global economic-growth forecast to 2.6% from 2.5%, while leaving 2024 world oil demand growth forecast unchanged at 2.25 million barrels per day.“Clearly, if this is true, there’s no reason for the Saudis to continue reducing production at the pace they’ve been doing, let alone warn about deeper impending cuts,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “The Saudi actions clearly demonstrate their fear that global oil demand is not as hunky-dory as OPEC makes it out to be in its latest monthly report.”Latest energy data from China showed crude oil imports fell 2.412M barrels per day month-on-month to a sixth-month low of 10.429M barrels daily as stockpiling wanes in the world’s largest oil importer.The United States is also prohibiting some investment in China in sensitive technologies like computer chips and requires government notification in other tech sectors.Meanwhile, India’s oil demand for July clocked in at 4.7M barrels daily, weaker than Wall Street’s expectations of 4.83M barrels per day.

301,94f359d8-2514-3575-ba7f-ffe9843bfce6,JNPR,2023-08-11,Growth driven by AI innovation in market: Juniper Networks CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/growth-driven-ai-innovation-market-145930269.html,1691679570,VIDEO,"['CSCO', 'JNPR']","[Juniper Networks and Cisco (CSCO) are two of the giants of networking infrastructure sector, often competing head-to-head in the space. Juniper (JNPR) has recently pushed into the AI space with its new AI platform. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the AI platform, the state of the industry, Q2 results, and company outlook.The Juniper Mist AI Platform ""oversees the entire enterprise network"" and it ""essentially takes all of the manual labor associated with running the network on a day-to-day basis"" and moves it to AI, which frees up time for network operators to work on much more innovative projects.Regarding company growth, Rahim said, ""The enterprise segment is now our largest and fastest growing segment in the business ... this is primarily driven by our AI innovation and differentiation in the market.""Video Transcript- Call it the eternal networking infrastructure battle. Cisco versus Juniper. Whether it comes to routing, cloud support, security, and anything around the internet of things, IoT, they're two of the giants of the space. Cisco has long been the biggest name for many. But Juniper has been knocking on the door for some time now. It's also making strides in the AI realm with its mixed platform. Results at the end of last month weren't quite as upbeat as investors would have hoped for.However, its third quarter revenue outlook below estimates on lower spending by cloud clients there. So does it still see itself as the keeper of global network? Big question there. Joining us now, we've got Rami Rahim, who is the Juniper Networks CEO. Thank you so much for taking the time here today.First, perhaps you could take us into this outlook here and just the demand environment that you're witnessing right now.RAMI RAHIM: Certainly, yes. So, you know, are seeing right now, you know, very good outlook for our business and for the year. We did have to moderate expectations for our cloud provider business, primarily because of the fact that cloud providers have consumed and purchased an unprecedented volume of products over the last couple of years. And they have to go through this period of digestion to essentially deploy these products.Story continuesWe're very optimistic that eventually, the cloud provider business will return. Our Q2 results were great results. We had record enterprise revenue, growing at 40% year over year. The enterprise segment is now our largest and fastest growing segment in the business. New logos are growing at 30% year over year or more. And this is primarily driven by our AI innovation and differentiation in the market.- Rami, I guess what I'm trying to understand here, because obviously not just-- you all have reported we've had a lot of companies thus far in tech and networking report. In terms of where the spending is, where the willingness to spend is at this point on the part of clients, to your point, the cloud spending has kind of happened, and so we're in a bit of a lull in that area. So where are we in that sort of tech spending cycle overall?RAMI RAHIM: Absolutely. Right now, our enterprise business is seeing incredible results. And the outlook looks very good as well. And we look at this by not just the revenue results that we're posting on a quarter of a quarter basis. But also just things like quarter growth, which continues to happen even in the face of very difficult compares to last year. As I mentioned, artificial intelligence is something that we've been investing in and innovating in now for the last four years. And we have had a front row seat observing the value that it can bring to consumers, to enterprises around the world.So for example, we're reducing the number of trouble tickets at a global software company by over 90%, reducing the number of IT store visits at a global retailer by over 85%. This was resulted in really healthy growth and an outlook for our enterprise business not just for the rest of this year, but for the years to come.- And you mentioned your AI offering. We mentioned MIST AI. Can explain to us exactly what that is and how it works?RAMI RAHIM: Absolutely. You know, I actually think we have a clear and defensible leadership in artificial intelligence operations today. What MIST does is that it oversees the entire enterprise network, whether you're a retailer, a healthcare provider, a carpeted enterprise, a college campus. And it essentially takes all of the manual labor associated with running this network on a day-to-day basis and moves it to machines, to robots. Essentially, artificial intelligence. Freeing up the time of network operators to do much more useful, much more interesting things, like advancing the strategy, innovating, and things of that nature.This is why I believe we're seeing such incredible trends in the enterprise business. I mean, we're in a mode of taking share in the enterprise space as a result of AI. And now, this enterprise is our largest and fastest growing business for that reason.- Are you seeing any moderation in the size of enterprise contracts?RAMI RAHIM: Not really. In fact, if you look at the number of large deal, which we measure as sort of million dollar plus deals, that continues to grow at a healthy clip. Our AI driven campus and branch business in the Q2 period grew at over 100%, or roughly 100% year over year. That includes large contracts and many small long tail contracts as well.- Rami, thank you so much. Rami Rahim is Juniper Networks CEO. Thanks so much for walking us through what's going on with you guys. Appreciate it.]"

Focus on providing bundled offerings and on-demand programming content that cater to changing consumer behavior bodes well for streaming players.Despite stiff competition, Cable Television industry players are benefiting from the spike in COVID-led demand for high-speed broadband. Strong demand for WiFi devices and wireless Internet has been a growth factor. Increased consumption of media due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns and shelter-at-home guidelines has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Comcast, Charter Communications, Rogers Communication and Liberty Global.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Cable Television industry primarily comprises companies that provide integrated data, video and voice services. Industry participants offer pay-TV services, including Internet-based streaming content. These companies provide equipment such as satellite dishes, digital set-top receivers and remote controls. Typically, cable companies either build their network backbone or lease physical access to the network backbone from telecommunication companies.These companies purchase licenses to provide subscribers access to cable television channels owned by programmers and distributed over the network backbone. Cable companies also sell advertising spots on their channels. The industry requires a high capital expenditure on infrastructure to enhance its services. The industry is highly regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.Story continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Cable IndustrySkinny Bundles, Original Content Driving Growth: Cable television’s ability to generate ad revenues outside traditional TV platforms, such as websites and any digitally-consumed platform, provides increased scope for target-based advertising. Nevertheless, consumers’ unfavorable disposition, particularly toward advertising, has hit industry participants hard.The growing consumer preference for digital and subscription services instead of linear pay-TV and rental or outright purchase has compelled industry players to alter their business models. Cable television companies are now offering a variety of alternative packages, including skinny bundles, which are delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings. These companies are also innovating in terms of original content to be competitive against streaming service providers.High-Speed Internet Demand Key Catalyst: The growing demand for high-speed Internet, including broadband, has aided cable television industry participants like Comcast and Charter. Improving Internet speed is fueling the demand for high-quality video and the trend of binge viewing.Further, a strengthening broadband ecosystem in international markets, along with the proliferation of smart TVs, is anticipated to drive growth. Also, the surging work-from-home trend and online-learning practice owing to coronavirus-induced quarantines and lockdowns have boosted Internet usage, thus supporting industry participants.Cord Cutting and Matured PayTV Industry Hurting Prospects: The cable television industry is witnessing the rapid evolution of distribution platforms as well as embracing new players and advanced technologies. Declining profits of residential video services due to rising programming costs and retransmission fees have made survival difficult for traditional companies.Additionally, the heightened need for on-demand content has led to the mushrooming of streaming service providers, making it particularly tricky for traditional cable television companies to maintain a viewer base. Furthermore, the traditional pay-TV industry is maturing with widespread consolidation. Moreover, residential voice service revenues are declining on the rising shift to wireless voice services.Softness in Advertising Demand Impeding Business Growth: Persistent inflation and higher interest rates are having a detrimental effect on ad spending. Besides, the challenge with TV ads is that marketers have difficulty getting actionable metrics and insights such as attribution data. At this time, marketers must look for outside-the-box solutions to extract conversion data from offline media. TV has taken a secondary role in most marketing strategies due to the growing influence of digital marketing.Many marketers are increasing ad spending on digital mediums due to their unmatched ability to deliver personalized messages that are easy to measure. Cable TV players are set to face competition for ad dollars from streaming service providers like Netflix and Disney, which are raising prices and introducing cheaper ad-supported packages now that their subscriber growth has slowed.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Cable Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

305,aaa70818-7d40-3d66-ae60-f96ad67e7cb7,DVN,2023-08-11,These 4 Measures Indicate That Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-measures-indicate-devon-energy-140012530.html,1691676012,STORY,['DVN'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Much Debt Does Devon Energy Carry?As you can see below, Devon Energy had US$6.41b of debt, at June 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$372.0m in cash leading to net debt of about US$6.04b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Devon Energy's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Devon Energy had liabilities of US$2.67b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$9.54b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$372.0m as well as receivables valued at US$1.52b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$10.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Devon Energy has a huge market capitalization of US$32.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Devon Energy has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.68. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 20.6 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, Devon Energy saw its EBIT drop by 5.5% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Devon Energy can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. In the last three years, Devon Energy's free cash flow amounted to 47% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Our ViewWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Devon Energy was the fact that it seems able to cover its interest expense with its EBIT confidently. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to grow its EBIT. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Devon Energy is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Devon Energy  you should be aware of, and 2 of them can't be ignored.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Fee-paying assets under management reflects the assets from which we earn management and advisory fees. Our vehicles typically earn management and advisory fees based on committed capital, and in certain cases, net invested capital, depending on the fee terms. Management and advisory fees based on committed capital are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation.

Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.Ownership LimitationsP10’s Certificate of Incorporation contains certain provisions for the protection of tax benefits relating to P10’s net operating losses.

The S&amp;P 400 Semiconductor index lost 27 of its value last year. Although the growth index hasn’t regained the highs it hit, investors welcome the 18% gain the top semiconductor stocks achieved over the first seven months of 2023.But there are headwinds still for the industry. Personal computing and gaming continue their rough slog forward. Consumer spending in each declined in the first half of the year. International Data Corp (IDC) says PC shipments tumbled 13% in the second quarter compared to last year. It’s the sixth straight quarter of contraction for PCs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArtificial intelligence is certainly one bright spot for chipmakers, but much of the rest of the industry is hit or miss. Competition is also intensifying in each of the segments as companies gravitate towards the money-making centers.Because the semiconductor industry is cyclical and the end of the down cycle could be approaching. Loading up on chip stocks now could be one of the shrewdest investment decisions you make this year.Intel (INTC)a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor StocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the biggest names in chips is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Its stock was hammered in 2022, losing half its value. It’s doing much better this year with shares up 35% year to date as sales and earnings have been stronger than many expected.Intel’s outlook for next quarter is also upbeat. Adjusted earnings of $0.20 per share are below last year’s $0.59 per share but represent the chipmaker’s stabilizing situation. Revenue forecasts are also ahead of expectations. There are a few reasons the clouds are parting for Intel. The chipmaker’s cost-cutting program is seeing results. It has reduced costs by $3 billion this year. That led Intel’s gross margins to rise to 40% and operating margins jumped to 3.5%.Intel is also investing heavily in AI. Its Gaudi platform is helping to contribute to a $1 billion pipeline opportunity through 2024.Story continuesIntel insists it can complete its turnaround by 2026. It believes it will regain much of the ground lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This makes it one of those top semiconductor stocks.“Ultimately, we will get back to process parity and leadership,” CFO David Zinsner told analysts.At 2.5 times sales, Intel is trading at levels not seen in the past decade making it a great time to load up on this semiconductor stock.Micron Technology (MU)In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.. Semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockMemory maker Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) is making up for lost time. As the leading producer of DRAM and NAND flash memory, it also was hit hard by the industry downturn. It lost 46% of its value in 2022. This year is much better with shares gains of 36%. Yet it still sits well below the all-time highs it exited 2021 at. Micron, though, is poised to make up that lost ground and more.Micron is embracing AI in a big way. It also just leapfrogged into the industry forefront.Last week the chipmaker announced it delivered the first stacked high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that packed 24 GB of memory into eight layers of DRAM, with bandwidth over 1.2 terabytes per second and a pin speed of over 9.2 gigabytes per second.SK Hynix (OTCMKTS:HXSCL) has long been the leader in stacked HBM memory. Earlier this year it had announced it was able to put 24 GB of memory into 12 layers of DRAM with a speed of 6.4 GB/s. Micron offers the same capacity in a smaller footprint. Moreover, it’s looking to put 36 GB of capacity into a 12-layer stack in the first quarter of 2024.Because AI is a memory hog, this development puts Micron squarely in the lead. It provides the industry with greater efficiency and lower power consumption.Mordor Intelligence estimates the HBM market is a $2 billion opportunity today. It will grow at a 25% compounded annual rate through 2028. AI is only one of the forces driving this market higher. Look for Micron to reap the rewards of its investment in the space.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. undervalued semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) went from hero to zero after Warren Buffett dove into the chipmaker head first and then uncharacteristically bailed out on the stock.Buffett amassed so many shares it catapulted into a top 10 holding at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B). Yet just as quickly, Buffett sold off the stock. Taiwan Semiconductor bounced back this year like the rest of the industry. Shares are up 28% in 2023, but they’re still 20% below their 2022 peak. It is confronting slowing end markets, delays in planned foundry construction, and capital expenditures at the low end of prior forecasts. Despite its gains, Taiwan Semiconductor is cheap. Trading at 15 times trailing earnings, the chipmaker is at levels not seen since 2016. All in all, it’s one of those top semiconductor stocks to buy.As noted earlier, the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Taiwan Semi is still leaps and bounds ahead of competitors such as Intel. When the industry recovers the company can quickly bounce back to form. For example, its automotive and digital consumer electronics segments grew smartly for the quarter. Auto sales grew 3% to account for 8% of revenue while DCE jumped 25% to account for 3% of the total.It’s not going to lose customers during the downturn. It’s just a matter of time before business bounces back.

They now charge 30 rupees ($0.40) extra for the cheese slice in most sandwiches, but are offering a free ""cheezy"" sauce instead.Rising prices for ingredients, including dairy products, have put global fast food chains in India under pressure to trim costs while keeping customers satisfied.Domino's promotion price for its cheapest pizza is just 60 U.S. cents in India, where its franchisee has publicly flagged concerns over a 40% surge in the price of cheese during the financial year that ended in March.Many Subway and McDonald's outlets in India have also removed tomatoes from their menus in recent weeks citing quality issues after prices surged around 450% to record highs.India has resorted to importing tomatoes from Nepal to ease the shortage.The cheese sauce now available for free at Subway India was ""developed for qualitative reasons alone"", said Everstone Group's Culinary Brands, which manages the supply chain for all 800 outlets and is the master franchisee for around 200.The qualitative change clearly isn't to everyone's taste.Subway has ""replaced the cheese slice with liquid cheese blend ... You just lost a loyal customer,"" one unimpressed customer, Sumit Arora, wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.A Subway store manager in New Delhi told Reuters the new cheese sauce costs 400 rupees/kilogram. Market prices show cheese slices typically cost around 700 rupees/kilogram.Story continuesA cheese slice, said Culinary Brands' marketing head Mayur Hola, ""can be added on at a small cost"". ""Ingredient costs are not something we comment on ... this is simply an upgrade to make our subs better.""Asked about the Subway move, Karan Taurani, a consumer discretionary analyst at India’s Elara Capital, said elevated cheese, grain and vegetable prices have pushed restaurants to come up with ""innovative"" strategies.""It is a way of putting inflationary pressure on the customer rather than going for a blanket price hike,” he said.A Subway sandwich costs around 200-300 rupees ($2.4 to $3.6) in India, and if a customer adds the cheese slice - which was once free - will now cost up to 15% higher.Spokespersons for Subway didn't respond to a request for comment.India's central bank this week raised its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to 5.4%, citing pressures from food prices.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World.Fast Food Industry: An OverviewFast food provides a quick, tasty meal at a good value. Ever since the introduction of fast food, there has been a consistent rise in demand. Like all other industries, the pandemic posed challenges for the fast food industry. People were social distancing, and the dine-out culture took a hit. However, the fast food industry has been recovering from the impact. In many cases, fast food chains have bounced back even stronger. The fast recovery of the industry can be attributed largely to how quickly the restaurants adapted to the dynamic environment during the pandemic. On March 27, Forbes reported that in the US, 30% of restaurants used online ordering and payment while 26% introduced delivery and takeout services, and 41% of the customers said they were more likely to use these services in 2023, compared to 2019. On January 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that in the US, in 2022, 85% of all orders were taken to go. Many restaurants switched to paperless menus as well. According to a report by IMARC Group, the fast-food industry was valued at $243.9 billion in 2022 and is estimated to grow to $319.7 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 4.7%.  According to a report by Precedence Research, North America dominated the fast food market in 2021 with a revenue share of 28%. The large share in the global market of this region can be attributed to dual-working households and high household incomes. The United States has the highest fast food consumption in the world. The fast food industry in the United States accounts for almost one-third of the overall global fast food market. Mexico has been predicted to have the highest CAGR from 2021 to 2028 which can be attributed to lifestyle changes and increased tourism. According to a report by Zion Market Research, the fast food industry has various segments, including end-user, product type, and region; the end user is further segmented into quick-service restaurants, fast-casual restaurants, and others.Story continuesGlobalization, industrialization, and urbanization have all combined to amplify the demand for fast-food restaurants. Fast food restaurants assemble and sell precooked food, the main factor in their quick service. Despite the rapid recovery from the pandemic and increased consumer spending capacity, fast food restaurants still face challenges like inflation. Food prices are constantly rising, also causing the prices of the end products to increase. On March 8, Bloomberg published an article saying that 60% of the restaurants in the US mentioned that they are understaffed and labor woes are impacting restaurant chains including Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ). According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the food industry is expected to have the highest employment upsurge from 2021 to 2031, adding 1.3 million jobs, mainly to fill the large vacancies created by layoffs during the pandemic.Recent Tech Advancements Fast-food restaurants are incorporating new technological advancements to maximize their efficiency. Many restaurants have started using AI Chatbots to take orders at the drive-thru. On July 10, Bloomberg reported that chatbots can reduce restaurant labor requirements by 40 hours a week. The introduction of AI could significantly impact how the labor market will look like in a few years, as the fast food industry is the fourth largest industry in the US and makes up 8% of all jobs. The trend towards cloud kitchens is also increasing. Fast food restaurants are turning towards automation in production as well. On August 2, Reuters reported that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will roll out an automated coffee-making machine in 10% of its stores by 2024. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) introduced a robot prototype that cuts and peels avocados, reducing prep time by 50%, and a double-sided grill that cooks 70% faster than the normal ones. According to a report by the National Restaurant Association, 58% of restaurant operators are turning towards automation and technology to cater to the looming labor shortages. Tech advancements could potentially change how the fast-food industry will look in a few years. Noteworthy Names In The Fast Food IndustryDespite the possibility of a global recession, the restaurant industry is booming and earnings are showing constant growth. Some of the largest players in the fast food restaurant industry include Restaurant Brands International Inc.(NYSE:QSR), McDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD), and Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ). McDonald's Corporation(NYSE:MCD) is one of the most valuable food companies in the world. Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) has recently reported high earnings despite inflation. Domino's makes pizza taste familiar to consumers by incorporating local flavors into the menu. Domino's Pizza, Inc.(NYSE:DPZ) sells the 49-rupee ($0.60) pizza in India, which is the cheapest pizza in the world. On July 24, the company reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $3.08 and beat EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $1.02 billion. Here are some comments from the Q2 earnings call regarding how the company plans on increasing its profitability in the long term:""First, pricing. During the second quarter, the average price increase across our US system was 3.9%. We expect average pricing to be similar in the third quarter before moderating in the fourth quarter to approximately 2%, when we left the carryout Mix &amp; Match pricing change from October 2022. Second, cost efficiencies as we continue to drive margin recovery. We drove improvement in our operating income margin, which grew by 240 basis points versus Q2 2022. This was despite foreign exchange rates having a 15 basis points negative year-over-year impact on operating income margin during the quarter.We now expect full-year operating income margins in 2023 to reach or exceed 2019 levels. Third, positive same store sales growth excluding foreign currency impact in our US and international businesses for the third consecutive quarter drove operating income improvement. Now for our financial results for the quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.8% due to positive sales comps and global net store growth. US retail sales increased 1.7%. International retail sales, excluding the negative impact of currency, grew 10.1%. During Q2, same store sales for the US business increased 0.1%. The increase in US same store sales was driven by a higher average ticket, including the pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by order count declines.Our carryout business remained strong in Q2, with same store sales plus 5.6%, rolling over a plus 14.6% performance in 2022. The US delivery business continues to be challenged. Q2 delivery same store sales declined 3.5%, rolling over a minus 11.7% in Q2 2022. We expect Q3 same store sales trends in our delivery business to be challenged, similar to Q2. However, we expect a slight improvement in trend in Q4 as our updated loyalty program begins to roll out, followed by a considerable improvement in 2024 as a result of transaction growth from our Uber Eats partnership and other initiatives Russell has shared with you. Shifting to unit count. We added 27 net new stores in the US with 30 store openings and three closures, bringing our US system store count to 6,735 stores at the end of the quarter and our four quarter net store growth rate in the US to 1.8%.""20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World TMON/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the most popular restaurants in the world, we initially extracted the names of the top 50 fast food restaurants from Technomic's Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report. The list was based on the highest-grossing restaurants in the US. As we pointed out above, the US is the country with the highest fast food consumption in the world which is why we have used this report to form our initial list. We then looked up the number of countries each of these restaurants exists in and ranked the restaurants in ascending order of the number of countries they were present in. This information was gathered from the official sites of each restaurant. The ranking is based on the hypothesis that a restaurant is more popular if it operates in more countries. We have used the number of overall locations for the restaurants operating in the same number of countries as a tiebreaker. 20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The World20.

(NYSE:UPS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, for US$10m worth of shares, at about US$190 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$180. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.United Parcel Service insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does United Parcel Service Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. United Parcel Service insiders own about US$116m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded United Parcel Service shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of United Parcel Service, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - United Parcel Service has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

Unions might,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-workers-keeling-over-extreme-120021208.html,1691668821,STORY,['UPS'],"[In the summer of 2022, UPS driver Esteban Chavez Jr. died from what his family maintains was heatstroke suffered while delivering packages in Pasadena. In June, Postal Service letter carrier Eugene Gates Jr. collapsed during his route and later died at a hospital.Farmworker Efraín López García died last month after working the fields in South Florida. Also last month, a utility lineman collapsed and died in Marshall, Texas, after working in a heat and humidity environment equivalent to 100 degrees.Those are dispatches from the battle against the punishing heat that has enveloped much of the United States this summer. It's a battle in which men and women with no choice but to work outdoors are on the front lines. In many occupations and many parts of the country, they're likely to be taking serious casualties.Employers have a legal and moral responsibility not to assign work in high heat conditions without protections in place for workers where they could be literally worked to death.U.S. Dept. of LaborFigures for this summer and last haven't yet been published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but its reckoning for 2021 and the previous 10 years is horrifying enough: 436 workplace deaths over that 11-year period, including 36 in 2021.The figures are almost certainly underestimated, because heat-related workplace deaths are often attributed to some other cause — cardiac conditions or accidents, for example. The toll is almost certain to be higher this year because of the unprecedented severity of the summer heat wave.The crisis didn't come as a surprise. In February, the attorneys general of California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania asked the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue an emergency standard for heat exposure by May 1.They projected (accurately) that heat this summer would outmatch the last two summers, and pointed out that tens of millions of workers, half of whom were people of color, worked in conditions that ""put them at grave danger of injury, illness or death from heat exposure.""Story continuesThey said OSHA mandates should encompass access to water, shade and rest periods whenever the temperature exceeded 80 degrees. OSHA turned them down, responding that emergency standards would entangle the agency in litigation from industry lobbies, distracting from its efforts to craft a permanent regulation and probably resulting in ""no tangible results for workers.""Read more: Column: The carnage from the rollback of child labor laws is just startingStill, President Biden recognized the urgency of action by announcing several steps on July 27 to protect workers. Among them, he directed acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a heat hazard alert aimed at reemphasizing to employers the existing right of workers to be protected from heat sickness. ""Employers have a legal and moral responsibility,"" the alert says, ""not to assign work in high heat conditions without protections in place for workers where they could be literally worked to death.""They include requirements that employers provide adequate cool water, rest breaks and shade or a cool rest area for employees; give new or returning employees the chance to acclimatize — that is, to become used to working in hot temperatures; and train employees to recognize the symptoms of heat sickness. Su's agency is also vowing to step up enforcement of safety rules on construction sites and farms, the most heatstroke-prone locations.Biden's directive aimed to fill a vacuum: No federal law specifically imposes heat safety standards for workplaces. Five states do: California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Minnesota.California was the first state in the nation to implement heat standards for workers, in 2006. They require access to fresh water at all times and mandate shade when the temperature climbs past 80 degrees. Agricultural workers must be granted one cool-down rest period of at least 10 minutes every two hours when the temperature exceeds 95 degrees.The missing element in California's rules is coverage for indoor workers, such as those employed in vast inland warehouses that often have no cooling equipment other than fans, which merely move the stifling heat around. The state Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been working on rules for indoor workplaces since 2017; the latest draft, which requires that they be cooled to less than 87 degrees, will be subject to public comment through Aug. 22.The California rules are enforced by the chronically underfunded and understaffed Cal/OSHA, which has a lot on its plate. Its jurisdiction includes not only industrial workplaces but amusement rides, elevators, mines, tunnels and asbestos and carcinogen monitoring.Read more: Column: A Teamsters strike against UPS could remake the union movement for the betterThat hasn't stopped employers from grousing about the state regulations. The Construction Industry Safety Coalition has called the state's rules ""confusing and ineffective,"" though its complaints sound a bit overwrought.The builders were especially irked by a state rule that sources of drinking water be ""located as close as practicable to the areas where employees are working."" That's a ""subjective standard,"" the construction lobbyists complained, yet Cal/OSHA ""regularly cites employers"" for failing to meet it.In his July 27 announcement, Biden referred to a heat-safety rulemaking procedure launched in 2021 by the federal OSHA. But there lies the rub, because Big Business lobbies have done everything in their power to challenge the OSHA process and ensure that whatever standard finally emerges will be shot through with loopholes and diluted into insignificance.The power of those lobbies was made unmistakably clear in Texas on June 16, when Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill nullifying city and county ordinances mandating water and shade breaks for outdoor workers.Among them were ordinances enacted in Dallas and Austin requiring 10-minute breaks every four hours for construction workers. The new state law, which goes into effect Sept. 1, also prohibits municipalities from enacting any such ordinances in the future. The utility worker in Marshall died six days after Abbott signed the law.You've heard all the arguments that Big Business has mustered against the OSHA rule-making before. They're no different from the arguments raised against any new regulation: One-size-fits-all rules never work, they're too expensive, they're ""onerous,"" they duplicate rules we already have, they require years of further study, etc., etc., etc.Then there's this all-purpose defense employers cite against any and all workplace regulations: We care deeply about our workers, so what's the problem? Or as the American Farm Bureau Federation puts it, ""Farmers and ranchers value the agricultural workforce.""Read more: Column: Wage growth doesn't drive inflation. So why is the Fed out to crush workers? Never mind that government figures show that farming, and its associated occupations in fishing and forestry, had the second-highest toll in heat deaths in 2017-20, exceeded only by the construction trades. (Says the Construction Industry Safety Coalition: ""Workplace safety and health is a priority for all members of the Coalition, and each is committed to helping create safer construction job sites for workers."")The business argument, as embodied in statements by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry lobbies, is that heat regulations are fine, as long as employers don't have to pay the costs, the regulations don't interfere with their ability to drive employees as hard as they can and the government is forced to waste years on extensive studies to support any new rules.Think I'm kidding? Look at the eight-page comment about the proposed federal heat rule submitted to OSHA in January 2022 by Marc Freedman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Freedman started by asserting that the factors contributing to heat injuries and heat sickness are ""so varied, so often unpredictable and so often unknown to employers"" that determining when a rule should apply is almost impossible.He asks, when is ""hot"" really ""hot""? He writes, ""There is no data of which we are aware that indicates at what point ... the risk of such illness becomes significant."" He quotes from a 2020 OSHA hearing in which a U.S. Postal Service lawyer got an expert to acknowledge that it was impossible to say exactly how many workers out of 1,000 would be sickened by laboring in 100-degree heat.""From the data I've seen,"" the expert said, ""it's more likely that employees will become sick on a 100-degree day compared to an 80-degree day. But I can't give you an exact number.""To the chamber, this pretty much showed that there's no point in writing a heat-safety rule because one can't be crafted to meet an ""objective"" standard — at least not unless OSHA is required to ""commission or request additional studies"" — which obviously would delay a rule for years.Then there's the cost argument. ""For many of our members,"" Freedman wrote, ""measures such as acclimatization and work-rest cycles threaten to directly and substantially impair their employees' productivity and therefore their employers' economic viability."" It's a harsh choice, isn't it: Work till you drop, or go on the unemployment line.Is there any relief for the working man or woman from the heat? The record shows that government is a thin reed to lean on — but also that one remedy for heat-related injury and illness is unionization. A study published earlier this year by researchers at the universities of Connecticut and North Carolina found that in 2017 through 2020, more than 80% of exertion-related worker fatalities (a category that includes heat-related deaths) were among nonunionized workers.Indeed, it was the Teamsters union that forced United Parcel Service to agree to install air conditioning in its sweltering delivery trucks, as part of the contract reached last month. Even in that case, the agreement took years of negotiations and an imminent strike threat to achieve — leaving the question of how many more workers will have to succumb to the heat before the rest of Big Business wakes up to its responsibilities.Get the latest from Michael HiltzikCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.Sign me up.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

(NYSE:RMD) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-buy-resmed-inc-nyse-100650290.html,1691748410,STORY,['RMD'],"[Readers hoping to buy ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, ResMed investors that purchase the stock on or after the 16th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.48 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.92 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, ResMed has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current stock price of $177.13. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether ResMed can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for ResMed If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately ResMed's payout ratio is modest, at just 29% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 46% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see ResMed's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 23% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. ResMed has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs ResMed an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that ResMed is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about ResMed, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.Ever wonder what the future holds for ResMed?

Well, big name retailers, including Walmart and Target, gearing up to report their quarterly results next week, and it certainly is a tricky year for retailers as they navigate what is becoming a more cautious consumer. So what names should you buy, and what should you sell? We want to bring in James Demmert. He's Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer, along with Brian Mulberry, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager. Great to have both of you.Brian, let me start with you. We talk about the fact that it's a tough environment here for retailers. More and more consumers-- we've seen this trend over the last couple of quarters. More consumers starting to trade down. Walmart is one of your picks. What gives Walmart the edge in this environment?Story continuesBRIAN MULBERRY: As you guys have been talking about, inflation has been a big impact on bottom lines across the board. Just simply the cost of doing business, labor and supply chain issues have made things difficult for a lot of these retailers. But Walmart has been a cash flow generating machine. And the more cash flow that you have, that you can reinvest in your own business without having to leverage right now is going to be a key difference as we go forward.I agree with a lot of the other comments made earlier today in that interest rates are likely just to stay higher for longer than the equity markets currently have priced in. Not that we have a huge disagreement about we might be at the top terminal rate or one more hike to go, but we don't see the rate cuts in the future. That just simply means the cost of doing business in the future continues to stay high.So these companies like Walmart, that continue to generate an enormous amount of cash flow, have that capital to reinvest in themselves organically and grow. And they've done so. They've made huge investments in their e-commerce segment, primarily to combat what they have in terms of direct competition with Amazon. And they're gearing up their home delivery services. And so they're using that cash flow to their advantage in this highly competitive sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So, James, let's pick up on that point. I mean, you know, Brian, looking essentially where consumers are going right now, especially with tighter wallets, talking about cash flow investments in e-commerce, is this a name that you would get in on? How are you looking at the retail space?JAMES DEMMERT: It is a name that we find attractive without question. And one of the few rules that we have, particularly in what I consider a stock picker's market, is the three most important things in retail which is brand management, brand itself, management, and as Brian mentioned, indebtedness.It's very important here that companies have very strong balance sheets and that brand awareness and really, really great management. And I think that's going to be a key issue as we go through the hurdles of stickier inflation and quite some time before the Fed cuts. So we've got a couple names beyond the Walmart that we find very attractive here.SEANA SMITH: And what are those, James?JAMES DEMMERT: The first is, back to our global style, a company like LVMH. Obviously, lifestyles of the rich and famous type of stock. But there again, the one-percenters tend to be pretty consistent through all kinds of economic climates. When we go back to our brand is important, these are probably some of the highest end brands in the world and well known and recognizable. Arnault is probably one of the best managers of a business, and we do buy businesses.And again, debt levels are important. So we want to make sure the company isn't over its skis, let's say, in indebtedness. So really the right mix. And here, you have the stock down about 8% from its high. Really love that as an opportunity to add to the position. Or if investors don't own it, here's a great time to do so.AKIKO FUJITA: James, really quickly. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the announcement that we got today of Capri and Tapestry because we were talking earlier about as much as those companies combined bring in brands under one umbrella, it's still tough to compete with a name like LVMH, which you're invested in.JAMES DEMMERT: I think it is. That's a very good question. And Etsy sort of falls into that same trap, where you've just got too many-- you don't have any brands of significance. You've just got a lot of brands. And I think that's going to be the differentiator for the successful companies over the next 12 months versus the others. So again, I would want to stick again with brand awareness, like a Tractor Supply, which we can talk about as well, has got that very significant presence, as in brand awareness. Really, really important.SEANA SMITH: All right, James, we'll talk about Tractor Supply in just a minute. But Brian, I want to get your thoughts here just on the luxury consumer given the fact that it sounds like you see a lot of the opportunity being at the other end of the market, the lower income market.BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, and it's certainly that we don't acknowledge the luxury brand. There has been a lot of durability there in spending from consumers. And we think a lot of that has to do with the fact most of those higher end, higher income individuals were able to take advantage of the low in the rate hike-- in the rate cycle and refinance usually what is their biggest debt, which is their mortgage. And that has cleaned up their balance sheet. And so their spending has been growing even more so than what you would see in the low to mid-income range.So there's absolutely a reason to have those types of companies in your portfolio. We think it absolutely makes a lot of sense. It doesn't mean that we don't like them. It just means that at this point, we're a touch more defensive, leaning a little bit more on free cash flow and operating income. And there's definitely going to be some consolidation, we think, in those brands that James was just talking about.AKIKO FUJITA: With that said, Brian, we started the conversation by talking about Walmart. There's another name that you actually surprisingly don't like, a direct competitor to Walmart. What's different here when you look at a name like Walmart versus Target?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Target really over the last couple of years has had a difficult time managing their inventory. And they now have a new problem where they just acknowledge that they have $500 million worth of shrink or theft coming out of the stores, and a lot of it is because they have so much on clearance and on sale that's really impacted their margins for a very long time coming out of COVID.And this affected a lot of people trying to get their actual goods landed in stores. And it had a ripple effect when you had a whole bunch of nonseasonable wares in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so they made a decision to try and clear out that inventory and not have to wait on it, but it has impacted their margins to a point where there's a little bit of a capitulation in confidence in the company, and that's starting to get reflected in their margins going forward as well.And so it's not that target is a bad company, they're just kind of stuck in a bad spiral, and they're really going to have to work hard to get out of that. Again, this puts pressure directly on those metrics that we like. Operating income, free cash flow, they've all been in pretty substantial decline over the last three or four quarters. And we don't see it improving until maybe three years from now that they can work themselves out of this particular hole.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Target shares off just about 12% so far this year. James, getting back to what you just said a moment ago, and that's Tractor Supply. You talked about the brand awareness, but this is also a stock that hasn't done much since the start of the year. What's the bull case here for Tractor Supply?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah. It's a stock like many of the stocks outside of the Super Seven tech that has gone a long way this year. And I think that the valuation should be the first thing that's attractive, right? PE, multiple versus growth. Then back to brand awareness. This is the leader in gardening, and even farm equipment, and all kinds of stuff that you'd like to do in the garden.And so one of the things and themes outside of brand awareness, which of course, they're the kingpin, is this incredible move by millennials to the outer parts, the more rural parts of the country and not just here in the United States. So Tractor Supply started in 1938. I mean, they are the brand. They're continuing to open new stores. So you have that expansion growth story.You've got brand awareness, as we talked about before. And wow, do they have high margins and extremely well managed business, as opposed to what Brian mentioned, the Target situation, which is sort of a mismanagement there. On the Tractor Supply, you've got excellent management, great valuation, and you've got that millennial push. They're opening stores. All the right mix of a company that yes, maybe hasn't done tremendously well so far this year but probably will in the back half of this year into 2024.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Brian, let's end on a positive note, sort of staying in the home improvement space. Home Depot, one of those stocks that you say you like. We've seen a bit of a transition in terms of what is driving revenue for Home Depot. We kind of went through the pandemic where there was this huge, huge push in DIY. Since then, it's kind of moved in a different direction. What are you liking what the company is doing right now?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Again, a lot of investments in where future revenue is going to come from at Home Depot. They moved away from that DIY segment and put a lot into their pro development. And these are the licensed contractors, the actual professionals that can come in and do projects for you. And that's been a big transition in their business. The last 20 years, they've been the DIY kings along with Lowe's. But now they've actually made substantial investments in where they see the future of revenue coming from.And there's a bit of a cycle in the consumer here where they absolutely did home improvements on their own. And then the value of their home went up so substantially, they started to sell it and trade up. And now it's coming back around to where people are going to want to have some projects and some improvements done. and Home Depot has by far and away made great investments in being ahead of that curve, so that they can supply the contractors with everything that they need to get those jobs done.And that's important right now because the contractors are making more money now than they ever have been because of the short supply of their skill set and skilled labor. And so being able to have a trusted partner where you can actually work very conveniently with your own personal representative online again in an e-commerce way, go pick up the materials that you need, it makes you more efficient. It makes you able to do more projects that's better for your bottom line and Home Depot. That's why we like them.AKIKO FUJITA: You've given us a lot to think about in the retail space both of you, James Demmert and Brian Mulberry. Good to talk to both of you. Really appreciate the time.]"

(Nasdaq: MDLZ), the company with iconic snack brands Cadbury, The Natural Confectionery Company, Pascall and others, today joined forces with leaders in the packaging supply chain to further advance a circular economy for plastic packaging in Australia. Together with Amcor, a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging solutions, the company is investing in advanced recycling technology pioneer Licella.The investments announced today will help Licella progress construction of one of the first advanced recycling facilities in Australia. Licella will use its innovative Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (Cat-HTR™) technology to recycle end-of-life plastic back into a crude oil substitute suitable to produce new food-grade plastic packaging.Cat-HTR™ is an advanced hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology, which uses hot, pressurized water to continuously recycle end-of-life plastic that would otherwise be sent to landfill. The new Australian facility, called Advanced Recycling Victoria (ARV), is anticipated to initially process about 20,000 tons per year of end-of-life plastic, with plans to scale up to 120,000 tons per year. Through Amcor, Mondelēz International expects to have access to recycled content from this site to meet much of its Australian soft plastic packaging needs, significantly reducing its need for virgin plastic in Australia.With sustainability as the fourth pillar of Mondelēz International’s long-term business strategy, the company’s sustainability initiatives are designed to drive growth and create value for its many stakeholders. Recognizing the environmental challenges associated with packaging waste, the company strives to work with partners across the value chain to help support a circular economy for packaging waste. Through its ‘Light and Right’ packaging strategy, Mondelēz International aims to remove unnecessary packaging and simplify packaging materials across the business.Story continues“While plastic plays an important part in the security, quality, protection and preservation of food products, there is a gap in sustainable local recycling solutions,” says Christine Montenegro McGrath, Senior Vice President and Chief Global Impact and Sustainability Officer at Mondelēz International.“Our packaging strategy is focused on using better packaging and helping to build better systems,” said McGrath. “This investment brings together multiple stakeholders in the supply chain to scale the infrastructure and technology needed to help create a more sustainable future for plastics and is part of our longer-term focus on working toward our goal of net-zero packaging waste by supporting circular economies.”CEO of Licella, Dr Len Humphreys, says leadership from industry is needed to help bring Australia closer to more sustainable plastic waste solutions that deliver both economic and environmental benefits.“This is the leading technology of its kind globally, and it was developed here in Australia. This investment will help advance our Australian facility at a time when demand for sustainable plastic solutions, that also help provide food-grade recycled content, is growing exponentially,” Humphreys said.Amcor delivers a number of packaging solutions containing more sustainable materials, including recycled content, says Frank Lehmann, Vice President of Corporate Venturing and Open Innovation at Amcor. “Amcor is continually seeking opportunities to invest in new technologies that will bring long-term benefits to our customers, consumers and the planet. We recognize our products can play a vital role in the circular economy, and partnerships like this enhance our ability to deliver innovative solutions for our customers, like Mondelēz International,” said Lehmann.Mike Cash, President of Amcor Flexibles Asia Pacific, added, “Amcor will be able to meet increasing customer demand for recycled content in the region with this investment, as well as take another step closer to achieving our target of 30% recycled content across Amcor’s portfolio by 2030.”About Mondelēz InternationalMondelēz International, Inc.

The hub, to be located on the King Ranch in Kleberg County, is expected to include the world’s first DAC plant designed to remove up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year.The selection enables 1PointFive to enter award negotiations with OCED and work in partnership to establish the South Texas DAC Hub. OCED funding will support 1PointFive’s development of the DAC Hub through the advancement of planning, detailed design, environmental permitting and procurement of long-lead equipment.“We appreciate the U.S. Department of Energy’s leadership to advance Direct Air Capture and look forward to our partnership to deploy this vital carbon removal technology at climate-relevant scale and establish the United States and 1PointFive as global leaders in demonstrating the commercial viability of DAC,” said President and CEO Vicki Hollub. “We believe this selection validates our readiness, technical maturity and the ability to use Oxy’s expertise in large projects and carbon management to move the technology forward so it can reach its full potential.”1PointFive’s lease agreement for the South Texas DAC Hub with King Ranch covers approximately 106,000 acres of pore space estimated to accommodate up to 3 billion metric tons of CO2 in saline formations. 1PointFive estimates that the Hub has the potential to remove and store up to 30 million metric tons of CO2 per year through DAC.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Textron (TXT) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TXT for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Textron's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Textron's main business drivers.Textron Inc., incorporated in 1923, is a global multi-industry company that manufactures aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools. It also offers solutions and services for aircraft, fastening systems, and industrial products and components. Its products include commercial and military helicopters, light- and mid-size business jets, plastic fuel tanks, automotive trim products, golf carts and utility vehicles, turf-car equipment, industrial pumps and gears, engineered fastening systems and solutions, and other industrial products. It is also a commercial finance company in select markets. Textron is known globally for its most recognizable and valuable brand names, such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee.Textron operates through five segments – Bell, Textron Systems, Textron Aviation, Industrial and Finance.The Bell segment includes Bell Helicopter. Bell Helicopter primarily supplies helicopters and supports corporate and governmental entities.  Segment revenues in 2022 were $3,091 million, contributing 24% to the top line.The Textron Systems unit is a provider of integrated fastening systems solutions, which include fasteners, engineered assemblies and automation equipment.  Segment revenues in 2022 were $1,172 million, contributing 9.1% to the top line.Textron Aviation’s principal markets are general aviation aircraft, business jets and commercial transportation. Segment revenues in 2022 were $5,073 million, contributing 39.4% to the top line.The Industrial segment manufactures and sells miscellaneous industrial products, such as golf carts, off- road utility vehicles, plastic fuel systems, and industrial pumps and gears. Segment revenues in 2022 were $3,465 million, accounting for 26.9% of the top line.Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) is a commercial finance business with operations in aircraft finance, asset-based lending and structured finance. Segment revenues in 2022 were $16 million, constituting 0.1% of the top line.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Textron ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in August 2013 would be worth $2,788.93, or a gain of 178.89%, as of August 10, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 164.14% and the price of gold went up 40.15% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for TXT too.Textron continues to enjoy strong order flows for its commercial and defense products across all its businesses. This, in turn, strengthens Textron’s revenue-generating capacity and expands its global footprint. The company expects a ramp-up of its commercial deliveries, which should further boost substantially its top line results. A solid product pipeline  and introduction of new products is expected to boost the its future operating results significantly. It is innovating new products like Bell 360 Invictus to capture more shares in the defense market. Textron also boasts a solid solvency position in the short term. Its shares have outperformed its industry in the past year. Yet, its businesses continue to be hurt by supply-chain shortage. Cost increases due to sanctions imposed on Russian companies may impact its earnings.The stock has jumped 14.03% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 4 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's howWorried about the economy? Here are the best shock-proof assets for your portfolio. (They’re all outside of the stock market.)Super-rich Americans are snatching up prime real estate abroad as US housing slumps — but here's a sharp way to invest without having to move overseasIn other words, the best businesses are the ones that can continuously reinvest and thereby multiply their profits. Buffett’s portfolio is full of these high-quality, rapidly expanding businesses.Here are the top three examples that highlight the power of compounding growth.HP Inc. (HPQ)Buffett has been steadily building up a massive stake in a legacy consumer tech company that Wall Street has overlooked. HP Inc. rarely gets mentioned as a tech giant. It’s not on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence or augmented reality. But it certainly looks like an undervalued and lucrative business.HP has a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 25.4%, enough to double its investments within three years thanks to the effect of compound growth. It meets Buffett’s definition of a “great business,” which is probably why he’s been buying a sizable position in the company over the past year.According to Berkshire Hathaway’s most recent 13-F filing, the company owns 12% of all outstanding HP shares. It’s the ninth largest holding in the portfolio.Read more: Warren Buffett gets gloomy: America's 'incredible period' is coming to an end. Here's what nervous investors can do right nowStory continuesApple (AAPL)Buffett’s largest holding, by a wide margin, is the iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California. Apple represents 46.44% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio as of mid-2023. That’s partly because Buffett has been raising his stake in the company and partly because the stock is up by more than 50% year-to-date.Buffett’s confidence in Apple is justified by the underlying financials. Apple has sustained a double-digit return on capital for several years and is currently operating at a ROIC of 32.5%.The continued popularity of the iPhone, lucrative margins in the software business and new products like the Apple Vision Pro headset could sustain this pace of growth.Coca Cola (KO)America’s most famous beverage maker has been in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for decades. Buffett started accumulating Coca Cola stock in 1988. By last year, he could boast of having earned over $700 million in dividends from his stake.After all these years, KO is still the fourth largest holding in the portfolio, accounting for 7.6% of assets. That’s probably because Coke hasn’t lost its market-leading position in global soft drinks over the years. It’s still a highly profitable business with ROIC of 16%.The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio above 25, which is arguably justified for a company with such a stellar track record of dividend growth.Few other companies represent Buffett’s investment style better than Coke. Investors looking for a safe bet should probably add this classic Buffett stock to their watch list.What to read next‘It makes an enormous difference’: Warren Buffett says this simple ‘trick’ is the key to earning a generous retirement nest eggHere are 7 amazing 1-week vacations you can do for around $1,000Blackrock’s CEO says art is a ‘serious asset class’ — here’s how you can own a piece of a Pablo PicassoThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Security firms and companies have raised concerns, however, that it could result in intellectual property and strategy leaks.Anecdotal examples of people using ChatGPT to help with their day-to-day work include drafting emails, summarising documents and doing preliminary research.Some 28% of respondents to the online poll on artificial intelligence (AI) between July 11 and 17 said they regularly use ChatGPT at work, while only 22% said their employers explicitly allowed such external tools.The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,625 adults across the United States had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points.Some 10% of those polled said their bosses explicitly banned external AI tools, while about 25% did not know if their company permitted use of the technology.ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app in history after its launch in November. It has created both excitement and alarm, bringing its developer OpenAI into conflict with regulators, particularly in Europe, where the company's mass data-collecting has drawn criticism from privacy watchdogs.Human reviewers from other companies may read any of the generated chats, and researchers found that similar artificial intelligence AI could reproduce data it absorbed during training, creating a potential risk for proprietary information.""People do not understand how the data is used when they use generative AI services,"" said Ben King, VP of customer trust at corporate security firm Okta.""For businesses this is critical, because users don't have a contract with many AIs - because they are a free service - so corporates won't have run the risk through their usual assessment process,"" King said.Story continuesOpenAI declined to comment when asked about the implications of individual employees using ChatGPT, but highlighted a recent company blog post assuring corporate partners that their data would not be used to train the chatbot further, unless they gave explicit permission.When people use Google's Bard it collects data such as text, location, and other usage information. The company allows users to delete past activity from their accounts and request that content fed into the AI be removed. Alphabet-owned Google declined to comment when asked for further detail.Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.'HARMLESS TASKS'A U.S.-based employee of Tinder said workers at the dating app used ChatGPT for ""harmless tasks"" like writing emails even though the company does not officially allow it.""It's regular emails. Very non-consequential, like making funny calendar invites for team events, farewell emails when someone is leaving ... We also use it for general research,"" said the employee, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak with reporters.The employee said Tinder has a ""no ChatGPT rule"" but that employees still use it in a ""generic way that doesn't reveal anything about us being at Tinder"".Reuters was not able independently confirm how employees at Tinder were using ChatGPT. Tinder said it provided ""regular guidance to employees on best security and data practices"".In May, Samsung Electronics banned staff globally from using ChatGPT and similar AI tools after discovering an employee had uploaded sensitive code to the platform.""We are reviewing measures to create a secure environment for generative AI usage that enhances employees' productivity and efficiency,"" Samsung said in a statement on Aug. 3.""However, until these measures are ready, we are temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through company devices.""Reuters reported in June that Alphabet had cautioned employees about how they use chatbots including Google's Bard, at the same time as it markets the programme globally.Google said although Bard can make undesired code suggestions, it helps programmers. It also said it aimed to be transparent about the limitations of its technology.BLANKET BANSSome companies told Reuters they are embracing ChatGPT and similar platforms, while keeping security in mind.""We've started testing and learning about how AI can enhance operational effectiveness,"" said a Coca-Cola spokesperson in Atlanta, Georgia, adding that data stays within its firewall.""Internally, we recently launched our enterprise version of Coca-Cola ChatGPT for productivity,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Coca-Cola plans to use AI to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its teams.Tate &amp; Lyle Chief Financial Officer Dawn Allen, meanwhile, told Reuters that the global ingredients maker was trialing ChatGPT, having ""found a way to use it in a safe way"".""We've got different teams deciding how they want to use it through a series of experiments. Should we use it in investor relations? Should we use it in knowledge management? How can we use it to carry out tasks more efficiently?""Some employees say they cannot access the platform on their company computers at all.""It's completely banned on the office network, like it doesn't work,"" said a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.P&amp;G declined to comment. Reuters was not able independently to confirm whether employees at P&amp;G were unable to use ChatGPT.Paul Lewis, chief information security officer at cyber security firm Nominet, said firms were right to be wary.""Everybody gets the benefit of that increased capability, but the information isn't completely secure and it can be engineered out,"" he said, citing ""malicious prompts"" that can be used to get AI chatbots to disclose information.""A blanket ban isn't warranted yet, but we need to tread carefully,"" Lewis said.

Well, big name retailers, including Walmart and Target, gearing up to report their quarterly results next week, and it certainly is a tricky year for retailers as they navigate what is becoming a more cautious consumer. So what names should you buy, and what should you sell? We want to bring in James Demmert. He's Main Street Research Chief Investment Officer, along with Brian Mulberry, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager. Great to have both of you.Brian, let me start with you. We talk about the fact that it's a tough environment here for retailers. More and more consumers-- we've seen this trend over the last couple of quarters. More consumers starting to trade down. Walmart is one of your picks. What gives Walmart the edge in this environment?Story continuesBRIAN MULBERRY: As you guys have been talking about, inflation has been a big impact on bottom lines across the board. Just simply the cost of doing business, labor and supply chain issues have made things difficult for a lot of these retailers. But Walmart has been a cash flow generating machine. And the more cash flow that you have, that you can reinvest in your own business without having to leverage right now is going to be a key difference as we go forward.I agree with a lot of the other comments made earlier today in that interest rates are likely just to stay higher for longer than the equity markets currently have priced in. Not that we have a huge disagreement about we might be at the top terminal rate or one more hike to go, but we don't see the rate cuts in the future. That just simply means the cost of doing business in the future continues to stay high.So these companies like Walmart, that continue to generate an enormous amount of cash flow, have that capital to reinvest in themselves organically and grow. And they've done so. They've made huge investments in their e-commerce segment, primarily to combat what they have in terms of direct competition with Amazon. And they're gearing up their home delivery services. And so they're using that cash flow to their advantage in this highly competitive sector.AKIKO FUJITA: So, James, let's pick up on that point. I mean, you know, Brian, looking essentially where consumers are going right now, especially with tighter wallets, talking about cash flow investments in e-commerce, is this a name that you would get in on? How are you looking at the retail space?JAMES DEMMERT: It is a name that we find attractive without question. And one of the few rules that we have, particularly in what I consider a stock picker's market, is the three most important things in retail which is brand management, brand itself, management, and as Brian mentioned, indebtedness.It's very important here that companies have very strong balance sheets and that brand awareness and really, really great management. And I think that's going to be a key issue as we go through the hurdles of stickier inflation and quite some time before the Fed cuts. So we've got a couple names beyond the Walmart that we find very attractive here.SEANA SMITH: And what are those, James?JAMES DEMMERT: The first is, back to our global style, a company like LVMH. Obviously, lifestyles of the rich and famous type of stock. But there again, the one-percenters tend to be pretty consistent through all kinds of economic climates. When we go back to our brand is important, these are probably some of the highest end brands in the world and well known and recognizable. Arnault is probably one of the best managers of a business, and we do buy businesses.And again, debt levels are important. So we want to make sure the company isn't over its skis, let's say, in indebtedness. So really the right mix. And here, you have the stock down about 8% from its high. Really love that as an opportunity to add to the position. Or if investors don't own it, here's a great time to do so.AKIKO FUJITA: James, really quickly. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the announcement that we got today of Capri and Tapestry because we were talking earlier about as much as those companies combined bring in brands under one umbrella, it's still tough to compete with a name like LVMH, which you're invested in.JAMES DEMMERT: I think it is. That's a very good question. And Etsy sort of falls into that same trap, where you've just got too many-- you don't have any brands of significance. You've just got a lot of brands. And I think that's going to be the differentiator for the successful companies over the next 12 months versus the others. So again, I would want to stick again with brand awareness, like a Tractor Supply, which we can talk about as well, has got that very significant presence, as in brand awareness. Really, really important.SEANA SMITH: All right, James, we'll talk about Tractor Supply in just a minute. But Brian, I want to get your thoughts here just on the luxury consumer given the fact that it sounds like you see a lot of the opportunity being at the other end of the market, the lower income market.BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, and it's certainly that we don't acknowledge the luxury brand. There has been a lot of durability there in spending from consumers. And we think a lot of that has to do with the fact most of those higher end, higher income individuals were able to take advantage of the low in the rate hike-- in the rate cycle and refinance usually what is their biggest debt, which is their mortgage. And that has cleaned up their balance sheet. And so their spending has been growing even more so than what you would see in the low to mid-income range.So there's absolutely a reason to have those types of companies in your portfolio. We think it absolutely makes a lot of sense. It doesn't mean that we don't like them. It just means that at this point, we're a touch more defensive, leaning a little bit more on free cash flow and operating income. And there's definitely going to be some consolidation, we think, in those brands that James was just talking about.AKIKO FUJITA: With that said, Brian, we started the conversation by talking about Walmart. There's another name that you actually surprisingly don't like, a direct competitor to Walmart. What's different here when you look at a name like Walmart versus Target?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Target really over the last couple of years has had a difficult time managing their inventory. And they now have a new problem where they just acknowledge that they have $500 million worth of shrink or theft coming out of the stores, and a lot of it is because they have so much on clearance and on sale that's really impacted their margins for a very long time coming out of COVID.And this affected a lot of people trying to get their actual goods landed in stores. And it had a ripple effect when you had a whole bunch of nonseasonable wares in the wrong place at the wrong time. And so they made a decision to try and clear out that inventory and not have to wait on it, but it has impacted their margins to a point where there's a little bit of a capitulation in confidence in the company, and that's starting to get reflected in their margins going forward as well.And so it's not that target is a bad company, they're just kind of stuck in a bad spiral, and they're really going to have to work hard to get out of that. Again, this puts pressure directly on those metrics that we like. Operating income, free cash flow, they've all been in pretty substantial decline over the last three or four quarters. And we don't see it improving until maybe three years from now that they can work themselves out of this particular hole.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Target shares off just about 12% so far this year. James, getting back to what you just said a moment ago, and that's Tractor Supply. You talked about the brand awareness, but this is also a stock that hasn't done much since the start of the year. What's the bull case here for Tractor Supply?JAMES DEMMERT: Yeah. It's a stock like many of the stocks outside of the Super Seven tech that has gone a long way this year. And I think that the valuation should be the first thing that's attractive, right? PE, multiple versus growth. Then back to brand awareness. This is the leader in gardening, and even farm equipment, and all kinds of stuff that you'd like to do in the garden.And so one of the things and themes outside of brand awareness, which of course, they're the kingpin, is this incredible move by millennials to the outer parts, the more rural parts of the country and not just here in the United States. So Tractor Supply started in 1938. I mean, they are the brand. They're continuing to open new stores. So you have that expansion growth story.You've got brand awareness, as we talked about before. And wow, do they have high margins and extremely well managed business, as opposed to what Brian mentioned, the Target situation, which is sort of a mismanagement there. On the Tractor Supply, you've got excellent management, great valuation, and you've got that millennial push. They're opening stores. All the right mix of a company that yes, maybe hasn't done tremendously well so far this year but probably will in the back half of this year into 2024.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Brian, let's end on a positive note, sort of staying in the home improvement space. Home Depot, one of those stocks that you say you like. We've seen a bit of a transition in terms of what is driving revenue for Home Depot. We kind of went through the pandemic where there was this huge, huge push in DIY. Since then, it's kind of moved in a different direction. What are you liking what the company is doing right now?BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah. Again, a lot of investments in where future revenue is going to come from at Home Depot. They moved away from that DIY segment and put a lot into their pro development. And these are the licensed contractors, the actual professionals that can come in and do projects for you. And that's been a big transition in their business. The last 20 years, they've been the DIY kings along with Lowe's. But now they've actually made substantial investments in where they see the future of revenue coming from.And there's a bit of a cycle in the consumer here where they absolutely did home improvements on their own. And then the value of their home went up so substantially, they started to sell it and trade up. And now it's coming back around to where people are going to want to have some projects and some improvements done. and Home Depot has by far and away made great investments in being ahead of that curve, so that they can supply the contractors with everything that they need to get those jobs done.And that's important right now because the contractors are making more money now than they ever have been because of the short supply of their skill set and skilled labor. And so being able to have a trusted partner where you can actually work very conveniently with your own personal representative online again in an e-commerce way, go pick up the materials that you need, it makes you more efficient. It makes you able to do more projects that's better for your bottom line and Home Depot. That's why we like them.AKIKO FUJITA: You've given us a lot to think about in the retail space both of you, James Demmert and Brian Mulberry. Good to talk to both of you. Really appreciate the time.]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, both Cemex and Vulcan Materials are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.83, while VMC has a forward P/E of 33.45. We also note that CX has a PEG ratio of 0.63. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. VMC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56.Another notable valuation metric for CX is its P/B ratio of 0.92. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, VMC has a P/B of 4.11.Based on these metrics and many more, CX holds a Value grade of A, while VMC has a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth CX and VMC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

353,ab214289-66e8-3970-b577-0677c935f213,VLO,2023-08-11,"With 83% ownership in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/83-ownership-valero-energy-corporation-110047192.html,1691751647,STORY,['VLO'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Valero Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 20 shareholders own 50% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 7.4% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 22% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Valero Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Valero Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Valero Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Valero Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$227m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Valero Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Valero Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on UnitedHealth Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$30b ÷ (US$280b - US$113b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.7% generated by the Healthcare industry. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 81% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesAnother thing to note, UnitedHealth Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 40%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.The Bottom LineThe main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 107% return they've received over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Like most companies, UnitedHealth Group does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.While UnitedHealth Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

REG seems well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium open-air shopping centers. Also, its focus on building a high-quality portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers and an encouraging development pipeline bode well.The company recently posted strong second-quarter 2023 results, aided by healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent. Moreover, management revised its expectations for 2023 NAREIT funds from operations (FFO) per share to the range of $4.11-$4.15 from $4.07-$4.15 guided earlier.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Jacksonville, FL-based Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has moved marginally upward over the past two months to $4.12.Shares of REG have gained 12.3% in the past three months compared with the industry's growth of 6.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes Regency Centers a Solid Pick?Healthy Operating Fundamentals: Regency’s high-quality open-air shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near the urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. With the continuation of the post-pandemic migration trend and the hybrid work setup, demand for Regency’s properties is likely to remain robust, boosting occupancy levels and its cash flows.In the second quarter of 2023, Regency executed roughly 2 million square feet of comparable new and renewal leases at a blended cash rent spread of 11.7%. Its same-property portfolio was 95.2% leased as of Jun 30, 2023, reflecting an expansion of 70 basis points (bps) year over year. Also, same-property base rent improved 4.7%, aiding same-property net operating income growth of 3.8%.Focus on Grocery-Anchored Shopping Centers: REG’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. Its portfolio comprises 80% of the grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.Also, REG enjoys a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers, assuring stable revenues for the company. As of Jun 30, 2023, grocery tenants accounted for 19% of its annual base rent.Acquisitions &amp; Development: To bolster its external growth, REG has been focusing on making strategic acquisitions and developments in the key markets of the United States. Notably, in May 2023, it entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns and operates retail properties in the suburban New York metropolitan area, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $1.4 billion. The merger, expected to close mid-to-late August 2023, will likely enhance Regency's geographic diversification, tenant mix, growth prospects and balance sheet strength.Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2022, its in-process development and redevelopment projects estimated net project costs of around $410 million at the company’s share. So far, it has incurred 44% of the cost. Management anticipates incurring $130 million of development and redevelopment spend for 2023.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Regency maintains a healthy balance-sheet position and had $1.2 billion of immediate liquidity as of Jun 30, 2023. Also, its investment grade credit ratings of BBB+ (Stable Outlook) and Baa1 (Positive Outlook) S&amp;P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, REG is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.In addition, REG’s current cash flow growth is projected at 21.54% compared with the 14.01% estimated for the industry.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Regency remains committed to that. Since 2014, this retail REIT has steadily increased its dividend payments and continued with its payments even during the pandemic. For the 2014-2022 time period, the company’s dividend has witnessed a CAGR of 3.8%. Also, REG has increased its dividend four times in the last five years. Check Regency Centers’ dividend history here.Given its solid operating platform and solid balance sheet strength, it is likely to maintain its dividend payout in the forthcoming quarters.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

Security firms and companies have raised concerns, however, that it could result in intellectual property and strategy leaks.Anecdotal examples of people using ChatGPT to help with their day-to-day work include drafting emails, summarising documents and doing preliminary research.Some 28% of respondents to the online poll on artificial intelligence (AI) between July 11 and 17 said they regularly use ChatGPT at work, while only 22% said their employers explicitly allowed such external tools.The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,625 adults across the United States had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points.Some 10% of those polled said their bosses explicitly banned external AI tools, while about 25% did not know if their company permitted use of the technology.ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app in history after its launch in November. It has created both excitement and alarm, bringing its developer OpenAI into conflict with regulators, particularly in Europe, where the company's mass data-collecting has drawn criticism from privacy watchdogs.Human reviewers from other companies may read any of the generated chats, and researchers found that similar artificial intelligence AI could reproduce data it absorbed during training, creating a potential risk for proprietary information.""People do not understand how the data is used when they use generative AI services,"" said Ben King, VP of customer trust at corporate security firm Okta.""For businesses this is critical, because users don't have a contract with many AIs - because they are a free service - so corporates won't have run the risk through their usual assessment process,"" King said.Story continuesOpenAI declined to comment when asked about the implications of individual employees using ChatGPT, but highlighted a recent company blog post assuring corporate partners that their data would not be used to train the chatbot further, unless they gave explicit permission.When people use Google's Bard it collects data such as text, location, and other usage information. The company allows users to delete past activity from their accounts and request that content fed into the AI be removed. Alphabet-owned Google declined to comment when asked for further detail.Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.'HARMLESS TASKS'A U.S.-based employee of Tinder said workers at the dating app used ChatGPT for ""harmless tasks"" like writing emails even though the company does not officially allow it.""It's regular emails. Very non-consequential, like making funny calendar invites for team events, farewell emails when someone is leaving ... We also use it for general research,"" said the employee, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak with reporters.The employee said Tinder has a ""no ChatGPT rule"" but that employees still use it in a ""generic way that doesn't reveal anything about us being at Tinder"".Reuters was not able independently confirm how employees at Tinder were using ChatGPT. Tinder said it provided ""regular guidance to employees on best security and data practices"".In May, Samsung Electronics banned staff globally from using ChatGPT and similar AI tools after discovering an employee had uploaded sensitive code to the platform.""We are reviewing measures to create a secure environment for generative AI usage that enhances employees' productivity and efficiency,"" Samsung said in a statement on Aug. 3.""However, until these measures are ready, we are temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through company devices.""Reuters reported in June that Alphabet had cautioned employees about how they use chatbots including Google's Bard, at the same time as it markets the programme globally.Google said although Bard can make undesired code suggestions, it helps programmers. It also said it aimed to be transparent about the limitations of its technology.BLANKET BANSSome companies told Reuters they are embracing ChatGPT and similar platforms, while keeping security in mind.""We've started testing and learning about how AI can enhance operational effectiveness,"" said a Coca-Cola spokesperson in Atlanta, Georgia, adding that data stays within its firewall.""Internally, we recently launched our enterprise version of Coca-Cola ChatGPT for productivity,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Coca-Cola plans to use AI to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its teams.Tate &amp; Lyle Chief Financial Officer Dawn Allen, meanwhile, told Reuters that the global ingredients maker was trialing ChatGPT, having ""found a way to use it in a safe way"".""We've got different teams deciding how they want to use it through a series of experiments. Should we use it in investor relations? Should we use it in knowledge management? How can we use it to carry out tasks more efficiently?""Some employees say they cannot access the platform on their company computers at all.""It's completely banned on the office network, like it doesn't work,"" said a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press.P&amp;G declined to comment. Reuters was not able independently to confirm whether employees at P&amp;G were unable to use ChatGPT.Paul Lewis, chief information security officer at cyber security firm Nominet, said firms were right to be wary.""Everybody gets the benefit of that increased capability, but the information isn't completely secure and it can be engineered out,"" he said, citing ""malicious prompts"" that can be used to get AI chatbots to disclose information.""A blanket ban isn't warranted yet, but we need to tread carefully,"" Lewis said.

""This contest is a way to inspire people, through the universal, human art of storytelling, to reimagine their narrative, resolve any struggles and, ultimately feel more comfortable having more robust financial conversations that advance their financial goals.""Conversations about money are typically driven by people's perceptions of their own personal finances and experiences growing up. A new survey of 3,000 Millennial and Gen Z Americans conducted by YouGov and commissioned by Principal Foundation, reveals that like social media, conversations about money are usually only showing one aspect of personal finance, avoiding more comprehensive and candid conversations.Story continuesMillennials and Gen Z are most comfortable sharing information related to salary or income. Less is being shared about topics, such as savings, debt, and investments.72% will talk about salary/income.60% will talk about savings or debt.54% will talk about mortgage or rent.49% will talk about investments.Millennials and Gen Z have underlying fears of being judged about their money habits.More than 40% fear being judged for their habits or earning level.Nearly one-third do not want it to create social tension with friends or family.30% do not want to seem materialistic or like they are bragging.Financial habits witnessed growing up can lead to anxiety and control issues around money later in life.More than half of Millennials and Gen Z continue with the same financial habits they witnessed growing up.40% agree that the financial situation they grew up in has led to issues controlling their spending.52% agree the financial situation they grew up in led to worries about having enough money even when they are financially stable.Millennials and Gen Z underutilize financial products such as retirement accounts, investment accounts, and protection products due to disinterest or reasons other than lack of funds.Only 33% report having retirement savings or life insurance.38% report not having retirement savings due to disinterest or reasons other than lack of funds.50% report not having investment accounts due to disinterest or reasons other than lack of funds.Women are more likely to share financial information with their partners than men.73% of women will share information about salary or income compared to 65% of men.60% of women will share information about debt compared to 54% of men.57% of women will share information about mortgage or rent compared to 47% of men.By reading stories presenting diverse financial situations, views and approaches to personal finance, this story initiative is designed to encourage people to reconsider their own situations and habits, engage in more candid conversations with those they trust, and develop more robust plans to attain the financial security they seek.Entering the contest is free, and 30 finalists will be selected by an esteemed panel of literary authors and experts including Mahogany L. Browne, Ava Chin, Novella Ford, Sidik Fofana, Xochitl Gonzalez, Alvin Hall, Erika L.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusBased in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 5.18%. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.22% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.52% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12.36%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.92 per share, with earnings expected to increase 11.07% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The dividend yield is 0.9% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. View our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Before making this announcement, Sherwin-Williams was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 24.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 24%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendSherwin-Williams Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.52 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.42. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Sherwin-Williams Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Sherwin-Williams has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 6.9% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Sherwin-Williams' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Sherwin-Williams Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Sherwin-Williams might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy. Please go ahead.Susan Gille: Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and on the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Board Chair and CEO; Lisa Barton, President and COO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following prepared remarks by John, Lisa and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's second quarter 2023 financial results. This release as well as an earnings presentation that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements.Those forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.John Larsen: Thank you, Susan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results were on track with expectations, and we have made solid progress towards achieving the consistent full year growth that our share owners have come to expect from our company. As we continue our long-standing track record of consistent execution, we have several areas of progress to highlight that will also serve to reinforce our strong investment thesis. Our focus on 2023 began well before the start of the year. As we shared last quarter, we took actions in the latter half of 2022 to advance our resource plans and added additional focus on cost management and resilience. We are pleased with the positive results from those efforts.Story continuesThe results are clearly shown through the advancement of key regulatory filings, great progress we've made on our major capital projects, and our expectation to reduce 2023 O&amp;M compared to 2022. And we continued our focus to derisk 2023 in the early part of this year by successfully mitigating rising interest rates through our convertible debt offering and interest rate hedging. In addition, we have seen strong core operations year-to-date. I am incredibly proud of the great progress our team has made in the first half of this year. We have seen remarkable advancements across all fronts including our focused efforts on operating a safe and resilient energy grid, our commitment to advancing clean energy and our unwavering dedication to delivering exceptional service to our customers and communities.In a moment, I will turn the call over to Lisa Barton, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to share more details on our investment and operating progress. And Robert will close the call with more updates relating to our financials and regulatory progress. But before I do that, I'll highlight a couple of key themes from this quarter. We continue to make exceptional progress advancing our investments that make our energy network efficient, reliable and resilient. We remain a leader in the renewable energy sector currently ranking nationally as the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind assets. We are continuously investing in a more diverse generation portfolio, prioritizing both value and reliability in our energy supply. A great example of this is our recently approved 175 megawatts of battery storage projects, which will complement our solar investments at Wood and Grand Counties in Wisconsin.We continue to excel in power quality and reliability as recognized by J.D. Power. Our ongoing efforts and results are centered around enhancing the resilience of our energy grid through the undergrounding of our distribution system. We continue to achieve new levels of efficiency in this area and have undergrounded more than 25% of our distribution system, further solidifying our commitment to a more robust and secure infrastructure. We are actively pursuing the exploration of cutting-edge technologies to establish energy storage capabilities, highlighted by our advancement of a first in the United States long-duration storage system at our Columbia Energy Center site. As we anticipate the retirement of the Columbia coal-fired energy center in 2026, we are committed to leveraging the existing infrastructure and interconnections at this site to promote resilience.The project has generated significant excitement within our organization, serving as a prime illustration of our commitment to pursue federal funding and embrace innovation to contribute to a sustainable future. We remain agile and proactive in identifying and capitalizing on financing opportunities that arise both at the federal and state level. Simply stated, we continue to execute our forward-thinking strategy and are consistently delivering financial and operating results. Our strong results are made possible by our dedicated employees. Every day, they work tirelessly to fulfill our purpose, which is to serve our customers and build stronger communities. Their exceptional contributions throughout the past year have been truly incredible.I want to thank and recognize them for everything they do. We eagerly anticipate another year of strong financial and operational performance and we deeply value your ongoing interest in our company. As a result of our team's efforts, our strong investment thesis remains. Our first half 2023 results are on plan. We have reaffirmed our annual earnings guidance and we remain committed to delivering on our long-term consistent 5% to 7% growth in earnings and dividends. I will now turn the call over to Lisa.Lisa Barton: Thank you, John. One of the areas that drew me to Alliant Energy revolves around our unwavering commitment to delivering value in a holistic and sustainable manner and our dedication to ESG principles. We are resolute in our long-term commitment to consistent growth in ensuring a successful clean energy transition for our customers and communities, making a positive difference in the lives of our customers and communities is a core value and guides us as we navigate the evolving energy landscape. We recently released our 2023 corporate responsibility report, showcasing our commitment to environmental stewardship, meeting the social needs of our communities and corporate governance. With a diverse portfolio of generating facilities, we consistently provide reliable energy to our valued customers while continuing to broaden their access to zero fuel cost and carbon-free energy resources.As we advance our clean energy initiatives, we prioritize competitive rates, reliability, system resiliency, sustainability and innovation. We partner and invest in organizations which proactively advance our industry's knowledge and collaborate on best practices. Now let's review our great environmental progress from 2022. First off, 40% of the energy we supply to our retail customers in 2022 was from renewable sources. Second, we reduced our annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel generation by 39% from our 2005 levels, evidence that we are well on our way to achieving our goal of a 50% CO2 reduction by 2030. We reduced our water usage by 50% from our 2005 levels, demonstrating our progress towards our 75% reduction goal by 2030.Looking forward, we have updated our clean energy goals to reflect our company's progress and strategic plans to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. On Slide 3, we highlighted examples of our sustainability efforts. Over the years, we have made significant strides in reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning from older, less efficient coal units to cost-effective and efficient generation resources, such as wind, natural gas, battery storage and solar. These resources not only demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability, but also served as lower cost options for our service territory, providing value for our customers well into the future. Building upon our successful wind energy expansion, our strong project management execution capabilities, we are focusing on expanding our solar energy portfolio.With our substantial investments totaling 1.1 gigawatts of solar projects, we are set to become the largest owner-operator of solar energy in Wisconsin. In 2022, we successfully placed 250 megawatts of solar capacity into service, and we are on schedule to add an additional 840 megawatts by mid-2024. Our investments are helping customers focus on their sustainability objectives in the communities we serve. With our customer-hosted renewables projects, we partner with businesses or communities to host an Alliant Energy solar farm on site. Two examples are with the Iowa State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In partnership with Iowa State, we are also investing in agrivoltaics, the study of crop or livestock production underneath or adjacent to solar panels.8 Countries With Highest Cost Of ElectricitySoonthorn Wongsaita/Shutterstock.comThrough our community solar program, we created community funded solar sites bringing the cost synergies of large-scale solar and offering customers an alternative to rooftop installations. Our Clean Energy Blueprint serves as our road map towards a cleaner energy future. This blueprint encompasses not only generation, but emphasizes the importance of an efficient, reliable and resilient energy grid. John mentioned our focus on resiliency by undergrounding our distribution system. Undergrounding distribution lines allows us to reduce the resources needed to trim trees, improves reliability and reduces the cost of customer inconvenience associated with storm response. Through our innovative solutions and strategic investments, we continuously strive to deliver sustainable energy options without compromising customer satisfaction.An example of this is our investment in the Neenah and Sheboygan Falls gas plants, where our advanced gas path upgrades will increase the efficiency, capacity and reliability of these units. Finally, in Iowa, I am pleased to report we reached a settlement with the Office of Consumer Advocate regarding our Iowa ratemaking principles docket. Settlement details are provided on Slide 5. The hearing on the advanced ratemaking principles for these projects was completed earlier this week. We requested an expedited decision from the Iowa Utilities Board so that we can start construction on these cost-effective investments for our Iowa customers. These investments will create jobs in Iowa during construction, support reliability of electric service in our Iowa service territory, bring shared revenues to our local communities and lease payments to rural landowners, all of which aligns with our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities.I will now pass the mic to Robert, who will share our financial results and provide additional detail on our regulatory progress. Robert?Robert Durian: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share. The primary drivers of the quarter-over-quarter EPS variances were higher earnings resulting from capital investments, including our solar expansion program; and lower WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries compared to the second quarter of 2022. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales when compared to second quarter of 2022 and higher interest expense due to additional financings to fund capital investments. For the full year, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $2.82 to $2.96 per share. The midpoint of that range is a 6% increase over 2022 adjusted earnings per share.Details on our second quarter earnings drivers and 2023 full year earnings guidance can be found on Slide 6. To assist you in modeling our quarterly earnings this year, I wanted to quantify and provide some additional context to the timing of income tax expense. Income tax expenses recorded each quarter based on an estimated annual effective tax rate and the proportion of full year earnings generated each quarter. This causes fluctuations in the amount of tax expenses quarter-over-quarter, but it will not have an impact on full year earnings. As we continue to increase our renewable portfolio and generate higher levels of renewable tax benefits, these quarter-over-quarter variances have increased. We have provided our quarterly EPS estimates related to the tax benefit recognition timing for 2023 and 2022 on Slide 7.We have already executed a substantial portion of our 2023 financing plan to fund our investments in renewable projects, to mitigate rising interest rates, and to support retiring a $400 million debt maturity, which occurred in June. In addition to several successful debt issuances in the first quarter, we have raised approximately 1/3 of the up to $250 million of new common equity issuances we expect to execute in 2023 through an ATM program and share a direct plan. Our overall financing plans for 2023 have remained unchanged, and our remaining debt financing includes up to $300 million of long-term debt at IPL in the second half of the year. Earlier this year, we also closed on the sales of 125 megawatts of our West Riverside natural gas facility, providing proceeds, which will help reduce our external financing requirements.The sales of these partial interests in West Riverside were anticipated in our plans and provided combined proceeds of approximately $120 million. The progress we have made in our generation transformation positions us well to take advantage of the enhanced tax benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act that will positively impact our cost profile. With our strong focus on cost competitive rates for customers, we are working to optimize the tax benefits available under the IRA and continue to make progress with the planned transfers of our renewable tax credits as we have seen strong counterparty interests for these credits. As a reminder, the proceeds from these tax credit transfers will be used to help lower customer costs on our renewable and battery investments, enhance our cash flows thereby reducing some of our future financing needs and improving our credit metrics.Shifting to regulatory. We have included our notable regulatory initiatives for 2023 on Slide 9. Lisa covered our progress with some key regulatory proceedings related to our planned customer-focused investments. In addition, we are also making progress with several other key regulatory proceedings in Iowa and Wisconsin. Starting in Wisconsin, the rate review for test years 2024 and 2025 includes request for recovery of several investments that support sustainability, reliability and resiliency while keeping customer value and competitive rates top of mind. This proceeding is progressing as planned with the next steps in the rate review process involving continued discovery and audit by the PSCW staff and intervenors to support their testimony scheduled to be filed by September 5, followed by a hearing on September 27, and a final decision expected from the PSCW later this year.We have provided the procedural schedule for WPL's rate review on Slide 9. Additionally, in Wisconsin, WPL submitted its 2022 fuel reconciliation filing, which requested future recovery of $117 million of additional fuel costs incurred by WPL in 2022 to serve its customers. WPL currently anticipates a decision on the amount of recovery and the time frame for such recovery from the PSCW by the end of this quarter. While our utilities experienced higher fuel costs in 2022, driven by elevated commodity prices. During the first 6 months of 2023, we have experienced significant reductions in natural gas prices and strong performance of our generation facilities, which will help lower future fuel costs for our Wisconsin customers. And in Iowa, we have already started passing these lower fuel cost benefits onto our customers through the monthly fuel cost tariff in 2023.Continuing with our Iowa jurisdiction in anticipation of completing construction of several key investments for Iowa customers before the end of 2024, we filed notice with the Iowa Utilities Board this week, that we will be requesting an IPL electric and gas rate review later this year. Our last Iowa rate review included a forward test year in 2020. And since that time, we have made significant progress in transitioning the Iowa grid, rebuilding from a devastating [indiscernible] storm and advancing IPL's transition to cleaner sources of generation, all while managing inflation and interest rate increases not anticipated in the last proceeding. The installation of the planned solar projects and the existing wind facilities in Iowa reduces IPL's fuel costs and provides enhanced tax credit benefits enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act.The retirement of the Lansing coal plant earlier this year is also a notable component of our generation transformation and will allow IPL's customers to avoid significant capital costs associated with continuing to operate the unit while reducing emissions and support the more distributed and changing resource mix. We appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials available on our website. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.See also 25 Most Profitable TV Shows of All Time and 12 Best Momentum Stocks to Buy Today.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(Image: North American Council for Freight Efficiency)PepsiCo’s fleet of all-electric Class 8 Semi trucks from Tesla are quiet, smooth and comfortable, while achieving ranges of up to 450 miles a day, according to a recent video from the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE).NACFE profiled PepsiCo’s distribution center in Sacramento, California, providing new details about the performance of the global beverage maker’s fleet of 21 Tesla Semi trucks. The video is part of NAFCE’s Run on Less — Electric Depot campaign, which aims to showcase how electric trucks can decarbonize the commercial road transport sector.PepsiCo received the 21 Semi trucks from Tesla in December with the help of a $31 million grant from the California Air Resources Board.Officials for PepsiCo said the Semi trucks are being used for both regional and long-haul deliveries across Northern California.“Out of our 21 assets of the Tesla Semis that we have here, three of them are dedicated to the long haul, over-the-road routes,” Dejan Antunovic, PepsiCo’s electrification program manager, said in the video. “The routes may change or may vary between 250 miles up to 450 miles. We have been aggressive to push the limit and demonstrate that we are able to achieve a very high range with a fully loaded tractor with the Semi fleet.”Amanda Devoe, transformation and strategy director for PepsiCo Fleet, said the Semi trucks are powered by four 750-kW chargers, which are also being used to charge electric yard tractors, lithium-battery-operated forklifts and a fleet of Ford eTransit service vans at the distribution center.“Because the good majority of our business is anchored and going to market, we deliver predominantly under 100 miles on a daily basis and run those vehicles around 12 hours a day,” Devoe said. “Within that duty cycle, we feel that the battery-electric vehicle is most advantageous in our decarbonization strategy.”Austin, Texas-based Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is slowly ramping up production orders of the long-delayed Semi. Tesla pitched the Semi as an all-electric Class 8 truck that would have a range of 500 miles fully charged, with a load capacity of 81,000 pounds.Story continuesTesla CEO Elon Musk said the company doesn’t expect to begin large-scale production of the Semi truck until the end of 2024.The Semi trucks PepsiCo received are part of an order for 100 Tesla Semis the company placed in 2017. Other companies waiting for Semi truck orders include Walmart, FedEx and J.B. Hunt.Pepsi drivers praised the comfort and performance of the Semi.“We get questions every time we go to a different facility,” Rhianna Castro said. “People see us long-haul drivers there and they ask questions and I tell them it’s so comfortable, it’s so easy to drive. You’re so close to the front of the tractor, your visibility is amazing.”Another driver said the Semi truck is easier to drive than she anticipated.“There’s no switches and gauges in the cab of the truck, so I had to strictly go off the monitors,” Casey Thijon said. “Within a half-hour I was comfortable with it. If you know how to use a smartphone, then you can easily operate one of these trucks. The turn radius is awesome. It’s better than in my car and a lot more comfortable and quieter.”Watch: Diesel fuel prices rise to an average of $4.24 per gallon.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyBorderlands: Stronger peso could pose challenges for US-Mexico truckingCanadian truckers fight to claim millions in unpaid wagesThe post PepsiCo praises Tesla Semi’s performance on long-haul, regional loads appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Juniper (JNPR) has recently pushed into the AI space with its new AI platform. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the AI platform, the state of the industry, Q2 results, and company outlook.The Juniper Mist AI Platform ""oversees the entire enterprise network"" and it ""essentially takes all of the manual labor associated with running the network on a day-to-day basis"" and moves it to AI, which frees up time for network operators to work on much more innovative projects.Regarding company growth, Rahim said, ""The enterprise segment is now our largest and fastest growing segment in the business ... this is primarily driven by our AI innovation and differentiation in the market.""Video Transcript- Call it the eternal networking infrastructure battle. Cisco versus Juniper. Whether it comes to routing, cloud support, security, and anything around the internet of things, IoT, they're two of the giants of the space. Cisco has long been the biggest name for many. But Juniper has been knocking on the door for some time now. It's also making strides in the AI realm with its mixed platform. Results at the end of last month weren't quite as upbeat as investors would have hoped for.However, its third quarter revenue outlook below estimates on lower spending by cloud clients there. So does it still see itself as the keeper of global network? Big question there. Joining us now, we've got Rami Rahim, who is the Juniper Networks CEO. Thank you so much for taking the time here today.First, perhaps you could take us into this outlook here and just the demand environment that you're witnessing right now.RAMI RAHIM: Certainly, yes. So, you know, are seeing right now, you know, very good outlook for our business and for the year. We did have to moderate expectations for our cloud provider business, primarily because of the fact that cloud providers have consumed and purchased an unprecedented volume of products over the last couple of years. And they have to go through this period of digestion to essentially deploy these products.Story continuesWe're very optimistic that eventually, the cloud provider business will return. Our Q2 results were great results. We had record enterprise revenue, growing at 40% year over year. The enterprise segment is now our largest and fastest growing segment in the business. New logos are growing at 30% year over year or more. And this is primarily driven by our AI innovation and differentiation in the market.- Rami, I guess what I'm trying to understand here, because obviously not just-- you all have reported we've had a lot of companies thus far in tech and networking report. In terms of where the spending is, where the willingness to spend is at this point on the part of clients, to your point, the cloud spending has kind of happened, and so we're in a bit of a lull in that area. So where are we in that sort of tech spending cycle overall?RAMI RAHIM: Absolutely. Right now, our enterprise business is seeing incredible results. And the outlook looks very good as well. And we look at this by not just the revenue results that we're posting on a quarter of a quarter basis. But also just things like quarter growth, which continues to happen even in the face of very difficult compares to last year. As I mentioned, artificial intelligence is something that we've been investing in and innovating in now for the last four years. And we have had a front row seat observing the value that it can bring to consumers, to enterprises around the world.So for example, we're reducing the number of trouble tickets at a global software company by over 90%, reducing the number of IT store visits at a global retailer by over 85%. This was resulted in really healthy growth and an outlook for our enterprise business not just for the rest of this year, but for the years to come.- And you mentioned your AI offering. We mentioned MIST AI. Can explain to us exactly what that is and how it works?RAMI RAHIM: Absolutely. You know, I actually think we have a clear and defensible leadership in artificial intelligence operations today. What MIST does is that it oversees the entire enterprise network, whether you're a retailer, a healthcare provider, a carpeted enterprise, a college campus. And it essentially takes all of the manual labor associated with running this network on a day-to-day basis and moves it to machines, to robots. Essentially, artificial intelligence. Freeing up the time of network operators to do much more useful, much more interesting things, like advancing the strategy, innovating, and things of that nature.This is why I believe we're seeing such incredible trends in the enterprise business. I mean, we're in a mode of taking share in the enterprise space as a result of AI. And now, this enterprise is our largest and fastest growing business for that reason.- Are you seeing any moderation in the size of enterprise contracts?RAMI RAHIM: Not really. In fact, if you look at the number of large deal, which we measure as sort of million dollar plus deals, that continues to grow at a healthy clip. Our AI driven campus and branch business in the Q2 period grew at over 100%, or roughly 100% year over year. That includes large contracts and many small long tail contracts as well.- Rami, thank you so much. Rami Rahim is Juniper Networks CEO. Thanks so much for walking us through what's going on with you guys. Appreciate it.]"

At the same time, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as for those without a disability.The Proximity Initiative is a Cisco-original program that I lead that serves our purpose to power an inclusive future for all. A Proximity Meeting is a one-on-one authentic, and transparent conversation with someone different than you with the intent to understand their lived experience, challenges, and successes based on their identity.Chris Riling, a pre-sales systems architect and I ""got proximate"", as I was curious to understand his experience with cerebral palsy and learn how I can support my son Bryce who is also living with cerebral palsy. In this blog we'll give you insight into our proximity meeting conversation.Alex: Hello Chris! I'm a Black man. I grew up in America, 20 minutes outside of Philadelphia, my father was a chemist, and my mom was a school nurse. I have two siblings, one brother and one sister, and I am the youngest. Related to my race in America, it was always something I was aware of growing up. I finally realized some of the confusion I had as a child, early in my career, and so forth. And since I've been able to be authentic around my identity, I've been able to be more conscious related to my interactions now, and I've been able to elevate my career; it's impacted everything. And a lot of that is because I had this realization through my son, who has cerebral palsy, around how he navigates the world and how he's so authentic and honest with his expressions and his feelings, which has impacted me to be my authentic self. That's who I am, and that's what I wanted to share at the beginning so that you can understand my lens and perspectiveStory continuesAlex: Can you tell me more about yourself?Chris: I grew up in Toledo, Ohio. Toledo is a small, midwestern city, but I live about 45 minutes south of Detroit. I was born with cerebral palsy. When I was younger, I thought I was invincible. You're oblivious to everything and the impact of things, and you're just trying to make your way through the world. I never put much thought into the disability aspect. I just had my mind set on taking my situation and doing the best I could with it. I never really put much thought into it until I started getting into the workforce, and I realized more people were questioning my ability because of the physical things they saw. So, I'm like, well, how do I counter that? So, you know, I went out and got all these certifications; I got three college degrees. I became a CCIE, and I did all this stuff. At least academically on paper, no one's ever going to be able to dispute my ability to do this job technically, right?I landed here at Cisco, which is a great place to be, but my limitations started to become more real to me. So, I realized it's better to be more authentic and allow people to meet me where I am. It makes everybody on my team more comfortable because they can come to me and have an open conversation.Alex: How did you realize that being more open about your disability made sense as a way of being?Chris: I can't say there was just one ‘Aha' moment. I wanted people to know I was here because of my technical ability and not for any other reason. I was trying to work hard to be the best engineer on my team. And at Cisco, I was doing a lot of traveling for work (and still do), and as you travel, you come across these situations where, you know, maybe we have to walk from the hotel to the office and from the customer site to a restaurant. I started to have these experiences, and people could see that I was struggling with it more than most. Many people just coming from a good place would say things like, ‘Hey, is there anything I can do to help?' And I realized I might as well be honest and stop trying to put on the tough façade and accept help when needed. I think it was a gradual process.Alex: And in those interactions, you've found that most people are willing to help and be curious.Chris: They don't always know what to do or how to approach it, but it usually comes from a good place.Alex: I also relate to you over-qualifying yourself regarding your academic degrees, certifications, and experience. There's an interesting moment where you're like, okay, now I have all these degrees and certificates, what do I do now?Alex: Was finding employment challenging?Chris: It was a little bit when breaking into the field, but I don't know if it was more challenging than anybody else when you're trying to get an entry-level job. Maybe a little bit. I did a couple of interviews before Cisco early in my career, where people would ask questions like, ‘How would you navigate this? Or how would you deal with going to customers' offices? How would you navigate doing this, or would you be able to do these things?' Anecdotally I heard after one interview that they were afraid about the perception of me going in front of their customers and what the customers might think.So, that's how I ended up getting a CCIE and a master's degree because, at that point, they can't deny your abilities; you're going to be too attractive to turn down. I kept upgrading my skills, getting more certifications, returning to school, and doing more stuff. I went through the Cisco Networking Academy program in high school and got my CCNA when I was a senior in high school. And so eventually, I reached a point in my career where I'm like, ‘Hey, I'm studying for a CCIE. I can probably work at Cisco'. I interviewed about 30 times for different roles at Cisco until I found the right spot. But once I found the right position and got my foot in the door, it was a great place to be, and I haven't looked back. It's been almost 15 years.Alex: How was it going through the Cisco Networking Academy?Chris: It was awesome. I wish I had known, at the time, the impact it would have on my career and life. I was into computers because when I was a kid, that was one of the only things I could do. Other people were outside playing with their friends, and I was inside playing on a computer. Since I had that experience at a very young age, when I got to high school, I saw that they had a Networking Academy at the time. It was a junior and senior class for CCNA, and they allowed me to enroll as a sophomore. So, I did it during my sophomore, junior, and senior year. I had no idea that I would be into networking, and it set me down this path that I ended up being on. But I look back on it now, and I'm like, that was a serendipitous experience to have gone through that early in my life and career. If I had known it would have that impact, I probably would have gotten better grades and paid more attention. [laughs]Alex: How has your experience been working with our customers?Chris: Overarchingly pretty good. Early in my career, customers were more skeptical. But I don't know if that was disability-related or age-related because I started here young. It was probably more age-related than anything else, but I would say most customers are pretty understanding and accepting, especially when you're coming from a place like Cisco; it comes with a certain amount of credibility out of the gate. And when you hand them a business card with the CCIE logo, there's an added layer of ‘I need to give this guy some time and attention.'Like any other sales role, if you come in trying to help solve their problem, you know, most customers are willing to listen if you're coming from a place where you're going to make their life easier.Alex: I shared earlier about my son, who has cerebral palsy. He is a high school junior, and for the next 2.5 years, he'll take a bus to a voluntary job. So, he'll get some job experience with the help of an aide with the idea that he can have a role after high school.Alex: Do you have any thoughts or career advice for people with a disability or for those with a loved one with a disability?Chris: I was very fortunate to have parents willing to go the extra mile for me. I remember them fighting the school systems to install ramps, make accommodations, all the support going through orthopedic surgeries, and seeking the right doctors. We were fortunate to have access to those resources when I was younger.When it came to my mom (who is now a nurse), she took no pity for anything. She was like, ‘Don't sit around and pity yourself, you're going to go out there, and you're going to do something, and you're going to make yourself useful.'That instilled a value in me from a very young age to not put self-imposed boundaries on myself. I realized that the biggest limitations were beyond the mental barriers you put up when you say, ‘I don't think I can do this, or I don't think I can be successful.' Encourage your kids to say, ‘Yeah, sure, I have some physical limitations, but there's no predetermined rule in life that says I can't do X or Y or Z. Strive for whatever you can reach, and I guarantee you, you'll get further than you thought you would.Everyone's lived experience, even if you have the same disability, can be very different. Much like my experience is different than Alex's son at the moment. None of us are disability ‘experts' - we all just do our best to navigate life based on our experiences and the experiences of others.Alex: My son has had seven orthopedic surgeries. We do physical and occupational therapy, and he gets speech therapy in school. We're trying to help him reach his potential. It's the unknown things of what potential you could reach, and that's what we're navigating right now.Chris: I appreciate that everything is always unknown, right? I wonder how mobile I will be when I get older, what I will be able to do, and what I will not be able to do. I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that. The only thing you can do is keep moving, stay active, and keep pushing, and you'll end up in a good place.Alex: Thank you, Chris for this inspiring meeting and sharing a glimpse of your lived experience. We all navigate the world through our identities and unique experiences. To power an inclusive future for all, and in honor of Disability Pride Month, take the inclusive action to have a conversation with someone who is different than you to seek to understand their lived experience.View original content here.Cisco Systems Inc., Thursday, August 10, 2023, Press release pictureChris Riling is a pre-sales systems architect at Cisco.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/773574/Disability-Pride-Month-A-Conversation-at-Cisco-Around-Being-Able-to-Be-Your-Authentic-Self-at-Work]"
