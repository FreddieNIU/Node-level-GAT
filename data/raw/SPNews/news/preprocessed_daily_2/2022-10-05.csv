The company’s capital deployment plan reflects a strong balance sheet position, through which it will keep enhancing shareholder value.However, elevated operating expenses might hamper the company's bottom-line growth.Analysts do not seem optimistic regarding the company’s earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s current-year earnings was revised marginally lower over the last 60 days.Looking at its fundamentals, while Schwab’s trading revenues declined in 2019 and the first half of 2022, it witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58.7% over the last five years (2017-2021). The company undertakes initiatives to enhance trading revenues, including lowering its basic online equity and ETF trade commissions to zero and reducing fees for the Schwab market cap-weighted index mutual funds.The company launched Schwab Stock Slices, through which investors can own shares of any company in the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at $5 each, even though the shares cost more. Also, it launched the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF, the lowest-cost crypto-related ETF available to investors.These efforts, aimed at building its client base, along with the acquisition of TD Ameritrade (October 2021), are likely to lead to further improvement in trading income.Schwab continues to benefit from the aggressive efforts to increase its client base in advisory solutions. Its advice solution revenues saw a four-year (2018-2021) CAGR of 20.5%.The acquisitions of USAA’s Investment Management Company, Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC, and the buyout of Motif’s technology and intellectual property further strengthened Schwab's position and helped diversify revenues.After slashing interest rates thrice in 2019, the central bank cut rates to near-zero in March 2020 (to cushion the U.S. economy from the coronavirus-induced mayhem), which hurt SCHW’s margins. Schwab’s NIM declined from 2.41% in 2019 to 1.62% in 2020 and 1.45% in 2021.Nevertheless, with the Federal Reserve having already raised interest rates a few times this year, along with expectations of more such rate hikes in 2022, the company’s margins are expected to no longer be under pressure. In the first six months of 2022, margins improved on a year-over-year basis.However, SCHW’s expenses witnessed a CAGR of 19.2% over the last six years (2016-2021) mainly due to a rise in compensation and benefit costs, and acquisitions. The upward trend persisted in the first six months of 2022. Increased costs associated with compensation and regulatory spending, as well as strategic buyouts, are expected to keep total expenses elevated in the upcoming quarters.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks from the finance space worth a look at are S&amp;T Bancorp, Inc. STBA and Arrow Financial Corporation AROW.The consensus estimate for S&amp;T Bancorp and Arrow Financial’s current-year earnings has been revised upward over the past 60 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The strong commodity prices will likely drive the financial success of the company.The price of natural gas has improved significantly in the past year. The strong commodity price is aiding EQT’s upstream operations, as it is a pure-play Appalachian explorer, one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States.EQT Corp is strategically positioned in the core of southwest Appalachia, which is connected to all major long-haul takeaways. EQT employs advanced technologies like horizontal drilling to operate in the prolific gas basin.EQT Corp has a huge inventory of drilling locations in the core Appalachian Basin that could provide significant production volumes. The undeveloped sites have brightened the prospects of EQT’s future natural gas production. This makes it well-positioned to capitalize on the mounting clean energy demand.EQT has lower exposure to debt capital than composite stocks belonging to the industry. Hence, the upstream energy player can rely on its strong balance sheet to sail through the volatility in commodity prices. Apart from reducing its debt load, EQT is focused on generating strong free cash flows and rewarding its shareholders. The company recently doubled its share repurchase authorization to $2 billion.Moreover, of the total greenhouse-gas emission reductions in the United States since 2005, the contribution of EQT is roughly 5%. The upstream player aims to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025.The current financial position of upstream energy companies is at an all-time high. The favorable outcomes are set to improve this year, owing to a perfect storm of factors pushing profits. Companies like Range Resources Corporation RRC, Antero Resources AR and Cheniere Energy Inc. LNG will continue to witness gains as the commodity price trajectory is expected to remain healthy.Story continuesRange Resources is among the top 10 natural gas producers in the United States. RRC’s board of directors authorized a $500-million share repurchase program, which is likely to be funded with the company’s free cash flow generation.Range Resources is focusing on cost improvement and marketing strategies to increase its margins. Owing to the peer-leading well cost and low maintenance capital requirements, the company is likely to generate free cash flow in the near term. RRC expects free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion this year, which could be the highest among Appalachian players.Antero Resources has positioned itself among the fast-growing natural gas producers in the United States. AR boasts 451,000 and 91,000 net acres in Marcellus and Utica, respectively, which will likely boost its production. Its core acreage position allows for significant long lateral drilling opportunities and capital efficiencies.Antero Resources has been benefiting from declining well costs in the Marcellus play. Being a leading natural gas producer, the firm emits lower greenhouse gases than other oil majors. AR is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising natural gas prices. It is prioritizing reducing debt. From 2019 through August 2022, AR managed to lower the absolute debt load by $2.2 billion.Although Cheniere does not primarily produce natural gas, it is a global provider of clean, secure and affordable liquefied natural gas. Given the first-mover advantage in the LNG export market, Cheniere is primed for significant revenue and earnings growth on the back of long-term contracts and solid operations.LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record higher prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Most analysts believe that deliveries are poised for further gains this year on surging consumption in Europe and Asia. This augurs well for Cheniere Energy, the dominant U.S. LNG exporter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This improvement was driven by the full impact of its recent pricing actions, operational changes leading to improved staffing and labor utilization, and the return of its signature Boost Week promotion. These positive developments caused a significant recovery in Domino's share price and its valuation increased to more than 28 times our estimate of next twelve months' earnings.  In light of the company's relatively high valuation in the context of a volatile market environment, we decided to exit our investment to raise cash for alternative investment opportunities.

9,e7d76785-afa4-3bf1-bf9d-7c867842e90a,STT,2022-10-05,Survey: Investors Showcase Shift in Fixed Income Strategies Amid Search for Higher Returns,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/survey-investors-showcase-shift-fixed-145600562.html,1664895360,STORY,"['STT', 'STT-PD', 'STT-PG']","[State Street Global Advisors’ Survey Highlights Allocation Toward Fixed Income Index and Alternative Investment StrategiesBOSTON, October 04, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors, the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), today announced the results of a global survey of institutional investors on how they view the fixed income market and how they are allocating their investments amid the ongoing market volatility.According to the survey report, The Future of Fixed Income, many investors are adding private credit investments alongside their public fixed income allocations. Additionally, they are showing a growing appetite for new, systematic fixed income strategies to help combat the impact of rising prices. The findings are based on a global survey of 700 pension funds, endowments, foundations and sovereign wealth funds, as well as wealth and asset managers.""Our research confirms that with the dramatic rise in yields, investors are concerned about how to balance risk and return within their portfolios, leading them to look beyond traditional public fixed income investments,"" said Gaurav Mallik, chief portfolio strategist for State Street Global Advisors. ""Now is the time for institutional investors to be strategic with their allocations, and they are finding increased opportunity to pair private assets with liquid publicly traded exposures. As investors navigate this volatile time, we are well-positioned to help them access these new approaches, meet their key objectives and manage their allocations and flows.""This year’s findings also reveal that fee pressure and increased transparency are leading investors to embrace index-tracking investments as a way to gain efficient access to attractive sectors. For many investors, allocations are changing and a balanced approach of active and index investments is gaining traction.""Institutions are embracing active and index fixed income ETFs at an accelerating pace to optimize their portfolio’s asset allocation and liquidity in this challenging market environment,"" said Bill Ahmuty, head of the SPDR fixed income group at State Street Global Advisors. ""As the fixed income market has evolved, some of the structural inefficiencies that were historically sources of outperformance have eroded, which has increased demand for index-based investments. However, there are still opportunities for active managers to add value, especially those with deep sector knowledge and credit skills in specific segments of the credit and loan markets.""Story continuesNew Sources, New ApproachesAs markets remain volatile and a recession looms, investors are intensifying their consideration of alternative sources of return. This change of approach by investors impacts how traditional sectors are viewed, adds increased liquidity risk into the equation, supports the rise of systematic strategies and may disrupt some longstanding preferences for active approaches. The report found that:As investors respond to the current market and consider their portfolio duration, respondents are especially interested in increasing allocations in bank loans (51%) and inflation-linked bonds (42%) over the next 12 months.Around one-third of investors (31%) elected to reduce their traditional fixed income allocations in favor of alternatives over the last nine months, and a further 29% plan to do so over the next 12 months. Those seeking returns in alternatives outnumber those going to cash.While only 14% of respondents globally increased their allocations to fixed income in the last nine months, more respondents (19%) say that they are planning to increase allocations over the coming year.Investors are showing interest in new, data-driven approaches to fixed income via systematic strategies. More than half (59%) of investors exploring these strategies say they are planning to use them to replace existing active strategies.Indexing Cements Its PlaceIndexing’s ability to capture the full performance potential of even the most complex fixed income exposures, in a highly cost-effective way, means that active management is no longer the default choice for fixed income investors. The survey found that:Over one-third (37%) of respondents say that more than 20% of their fixed income portfolio is allocated to index strategies. For larger investors (those with AUM over $10 billion), this figure increases to 57%.46% of respondents agree that they’re ""under a lot of pressure to make more efficient use of fees"" in fixed income.More than two-thirds (76%) of respondents are not planning to make meaningful changes to their balance of index and active strategies in the next 12 months. Among those who do expect to make a change, more will meaningfully increase their overall fixed income allocation to index (14%) than to active (10%).For survey respondents who plan to increase allocations to inflation-linked bonds, a majority plan to use indexed approaches.ESG Tops the Fixed Income Agenda for Certain InvestorsESG emerged as a top priority for certain institutional investors, overtaking managing the effects of inflation and rising rates. The report found that:More than one-third (39%) of respondents say integrating ESG considerations is the most important priority to address through their fixed income allocations over the next 12 months.Nearly half of investors have integrated ESG factors within high yield corporate credit (47%). Investment-grade credit (44%), emerging market debt, and sovereigns (each 41%) are also making good progress, but securitized debt (27%) continues to pose a challenge.About the SurveyThe qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted in mid-2022 and was administered by an independent third-party firm not affiliated with State Street Global Advisors. State Street Global Advisors is identified as the study sponsor. A total of 700 global institutional investors responsible for asset-allocation decisions for top pension funds, wealth managers, asset managers, endowments, foundations and sovereign wealth funds participated in the study.

Sales have been slowing and that is worrying retailers. However, even then, they are banking heavily on the upcoming holiday season, which like every year, is expected to boost retail sales.Retailers are thus leaving no stone unturned to make the most of the holiday season. Although the sector is faced with several challenges, including soaring commodity prices, retailers are trying their best to ramp up sales during this period. Several retailers this year plan to launch early holiday deals, while others are on a hiring spree to meet the surge in demand during that period.Aggressive HiringThe retail sector has been struggling with sales slowing month over month for quite some time. However, a modest but 0.4% jump in retail sales in August ahead of the holiday season is a good sign for the worried retailers. Although rising prices have been impacting retail sales over the past few months, the sector has still managed to fight back as higher demand for goods has been driving sales.Besides, the industry is facing several other challenges. Supply-chain crisis and higher freight charges are also hindering smooth sales. However, retailers are hopeful for a great holiday season.Holiday season sales account for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers and are one of the most important sales windows. And this holiday season might not be as bad for the retail sector as was initially anticipated. The annual holiday retail estimate from Deloitte predicts a 4-6% increase in retail sales.Spending will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion between November and January. Sales during the holiday season last year totaled $1.49 trillion, a 15.1% increase from 2020. Given that everyone is wary about spending this year, the prediction is quite low, but the good thing is that even then, sales are expected to rise quite significantly.Story continuesThis has made retailers optimistic, and they are once again going on a hiring spree. Retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Target Corporation TGT will be launching early holiday deals, which will begin in October.Target Corporation plans to hire 10,000 seasonal workers ahead of the holiday season to meet customers’ demands during that period. TGT is also back with its ‘Target Deals Day’ with the aim of luring more customers to buy essentials and must-have products. This time, Target Corporation will start the ‘Target Deals Day’ on Oct 6, which will continue till Oct 8.Moreover, for those who look for the best deals, TGT is coming up with “Holiday Price Match Guarantee.” The offer will start on Oct 6 and continue through Dec 24. Target Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS too is aggressively hiring workers for the upcoming holiday season. DKS plans to hire at least 9,000 heads ahead of the holiday season. DICK’s Sporting Goods has been doing well despite the sector facing several challenges because of its both strong online and offline presence. Given that a lot of people plan to travel this year, DKS expects sales of its athletic wear to grow during the holiday season.Walmart Inc. WMT has always been a major player during the holiday season. This time it’s going to be no different. WMT will be hiring 40,000 workers ahead of the holiday season. Walmart intends to fill in a wide range of positions, from temporary store clerks to full-time, permanent truck drivers. For the holiday season, Walmart more hours will be available to its existing employees.Walmart also unveiled updated return policies and windows, including a return pickup from home option for Walmart+ members for the holiday season.Macy's, Inc. M is also keeping pace with other major retailers and is planning to hire thousands of workers for the holiday season. Last week, M said that it was looking to hire more than 41,000 seasonal full- and part-time employees for its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury stores, as well as call centers and supply-chain locations.Macy said that it will start its pay at $15 per hour, with flexible scheduling options that may include voluntary overtime.

17,6154368b-9382-39aa-830d-7951a65836c2,WMT,2022-10-05,12 Biggest Delivery Companies In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-biggest-delivery-companies-world-143809882.html,1664894289,STORY,"['TFII', 'UBER', 'WMT', 'AMZN']","[In this article, we discuss the 12 biggest delivery companies in the world. If you want to read about some more delivery companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Delivery Companies In The World.It is remarkable how fast the delivery industry is evolving. In developing countries in Asia, to quote an alarming example, life-saving ambulances take longer to arrive than food or e-commerce deliveries. The sector seems in sync with the rapidly changing tech side and is adapting to new inventions, like drone delivery, faster than other parts of the business world. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that the pandemic has more than doubled the size of the delivery sector in just a year, compared to historical 8% growth figures for the preceding year. Most of the success of the delivery sector can be attributed to the evolution of business models. For example, the advent of same hour, same day, and next day delivery, the use of a single fleet, multi-fleet, crowdsourced fleets, and in-house fleets, as well as deliver from store, curb-side pickup, and delivery from robotic warehouses, and other innovations. Some of the top firms in the sector include Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). McKinsey claims that even as the delivery space evolves, there are still macro considerations that continue to shape the economic structure. These include brand, real estate, operating efficiency, breadth of offerings, changing consumer habits, and potential regulatory constraints. Per the consulting firm, these factors will together determine which stakeholders win or lose as the industry develops, including possible changes to how delivery workers are compensated and how a cost-intensive business that is low-margin and scale-driven grows profitable.Explosive Growth Potential in Online and Food DeliveryThe trends in the online ordering and food delivery space deserve a special mention in the delivery industry since they offer investors explosive growth potential. In the past five years, online food ordering and restaurant deliveries have increased at an annual rate of 20%. This increase has come despite a gradual increase in the cost of delivery. These rates will climb to $220 billion by 2025, representing almost 40% of the total restaurant sales. 42% of restaurant orders are now being placed online, according to conservative estimates. Story continuesFor context, the annual growth rate of the food industry is about 3.7%, while online ordering and food delivery are growing at an annual rate of about 15% to 20%. Despite these impressive numbers, customer retention remains a key problem for the biggest delivery companies. This is important because customer retention is inextricably linked to revenue growth. According to research conducted at Harvard Business School, a mere 5% increase in customer retention can help you raise profits up to 95%. Despite challenges, investors continue to pour money into the delivery sector, attesting to the long-term potential of the business. Delivery firm Wolt raised $530 million in January 2021, REEF Technology raised $700 million in November 2020, Rebel Foods raised $26 million in July 2020, Uber purchased Postmates for $2.6 billion in December 2020, and Just Eat Takeaway acquired Grubhub for $7.3 billion in June 2021. DoorDash and Deliveroo recently had IPOs in December 2020 and March 2021. Big tech firms are investing in the space too. Key Trends Shaping The Delivery SectorSome of the top trends expected to shape the future of the delivery space include increased third party deliveries, the rise of in-house restaurant delivery fleets, the prioritizing of delivery data tracking, the entry of tech giants moving into food delivery, the rapid growth of online grocery, and the rise in food delivery subscriptions. A lot of these trends have a larger backdrop related to the increasing proliferation of smart devices and the internet, or the rise of the digital world, that a lot of the younger generation is already used to. Per McKinsey, geographic competition among delivery giants will be one of the biggest battlegrounds in the industry over the next few years. The commission rates for restaurants are also another important consideration since they are an important source of revenue for many delivery applications. The consulting firm has underlined that delivery platforms are poised to generate profits at scale if they can unlock the logistics, operational requirements, and challenges of last-mile delivery.  For customers, these challenges and growth drivers will result in better service experiences. The increased competition among businesses will lead to creative revenue models. The delivery sector is one of the many spaces where small and medium businesses can continue to thrive and expand despite big tech investment. This is because of the emergence of low-cost technology that can help underdogs in the industry just as much as big tech firms. The delivery sector is no doubt one of the most exciting spaces to watch in the next few years. Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the delivery industry. The details of each delivery company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. 12 Biggest Delivery Companies In The WorldRasica/Shutterstock.comBiggest Delivery Companies In The World12. Blue Dart Express Blue Dart Express is an Indian logistics company based in Mumbai. The company registered a revenue of INR 3,288 billion in FY2021. It also has a cash-on-delivery option for courier services. DHL is one of the major shareholders in Blue Dart Express. Just like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Blue Dart Express is one of the best delivery companies to watch. 11. Royal Mail Royal Mail is a UK-based mail and courier service with headquarters in London. Within the UK, it offers same-day delivery of couriers and mail. Additionally, it offers Guaranteed Special Delivery for residential addresses between the hours of 9am and 1pm. For foreign shipments to be accepted for shipping, the weight limit is 2kg. While international economy shipping might take up to two weeks, international standard delivery can take anywhere from three to five days.10. Yamato HoldingsYamato Holdings is a delivery and logistics provider based in Tokyo. The company currently has 216,873 employees and extends its services from Japan and North America to the global level. With a market share of 41%, it is among the biggest door-to-door delivery services in Japan and faces stiff competition from Sagawa Express and Nippon Express. 9. DelhiveryDelhivery is an Indian supply chain and logistics company, employing over 66,000 people. Rivigo, Shiprocket, and Omnibiz are Delhivery’s top competitors. As of 2021, the company had more than 85 fulfilment centres, 24 automated sorting facilities, 70 hubs, 7,500 partner facilities, and 3,000 direct delivery facilities. Giving e-commerce businesses third-party logistics and delivery services accounts for almost two-thirds of its revenue. It is headquartered in Gurgaon. 8. TFI International TFI International is a Canadian company, headquartered in Saint-Laurent, and employs over 28,286 people. The company provides logistics and transportation services in Canada, the USA, and Mexico. The firm generated a revenue of $7.22 billion in 2021, and its Growth in Revenues (YoY) stands at 75.44%. JB Hunt Transport Inc, Swift Transportation Co, and Werner Enterprises Inc are some of the main competitors. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm DE Shaw is a leading shareholder in TFI International, with 433,784 shares worth more than $46 million. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, LRT Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) (formerly known as Transforce) is a recent addition to our portfolio – it is a Canadian logistics company with exceptional management operating in a consolidating industry. TFII came to our attention when they announced their purchase of the US operations of UPS Freight on January 25th, 2021. The company has a long history of growth through acquisition. Long time CEO Alain Bedard is fond of telling investors that he would rather own Scotiabank and get a 3% dividend than make deals that result in 3% returns57. This Canadian company also recently dual-listed in the United States.UPS Freight, recently acquired by TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII), is a less-than-truckload (LTL) operation. LTL operations can build scale-based cost advantages as they require the consolidation of shipments in local hubs. This lends LTL operators to develop competitive moats based on local network density creating barriers to entry, as opposed to pure long-term trucking which is open to competition from anyone able to lease a truck. Pure play LTL companies such as SAIA, Inc. (SAIA) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) have historically generated very attractive returns for shareholders. Prior to the announced acquisition TFI already generated excellent returns for shareholders through very efficient operations and good capital allocation. Through the acquisition of UPS Freight US, the company immediately became one of the largest players in the US LTL market. The relatively low price paid for the asset (5.3x EBITDA pre-synergies, and the fact that UPS is taking a $500 million accounting charge on the deal) suggests TFII got a good deal. ODFL and SAIA both trade at over 15x EV/EBITDA.We expect earnings to rise sharply at TFI International Inc. (NYSE:TFII) over the next twelve months as the economy accelerates post-Covid. We are currently also long shares of Saia, Inc. (SAIA), the LTL operator headquartered in Georgia, based on the same investment thesis.

They are expected to agree to a reduction of at least 1 million barrels a day to push up crude prices, though some analysts believe the cuts could reach 2 million.Reduced supply would likely drive up US gas prices ahead of November's midterm elections, as they could lead to a rally in oil prices from their recent losses. The November 8 elections are just five weeks away.The White House described the expected OPEC+ output cuts as a ""total disaster"" that could be seen as a ""hostile act"" in draft talking points to the US Treasury cited by CNN.President Joe Biden has emphasized a recent slide in gas prices as part of his re-election campaign, with the White House championing his efforts to lower ""everyday costs for American families"".""Higher oil prices, if driven by sizeable production cuts, would likely irritate the Biden administration ahead of U.S. midterm elections,"" Citi strategists said in a note, per Reuters.""There could be further political reactions from the U.S., including additional releases of strategic stocks,"" they added. The Biden administration could also push forward with an anti-trust bill targeting OPEC, they said.The White House didn't immediately respond to an Insider request for comment.""We've been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for consumers around the world and we will continue to talk with our partners about that,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told CNN.Story continuesThis wouldn't be the first time that the Biden administration has clashed with OPEC+ over supply cuts. The oil cartel refused to release additional stocks to the market after Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove crude prices above $125 a barrel in March.The US has already been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude oil exporter, to keep its output high and drag down Russia's oil revenues. In July, Biden met Saudi de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman, but failed to agree a deal for the country to ramp up supply.OPEC's power faded in the past decade thanks to the US shale boom, but its power is now at an all-time high, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Jeff Currie.The reason OPEC is considering a cut to production even as the oil market remains tight with low inventories is that crude prices have fallen because investors are fleeing the market, Currie told CNBC.Oil prices have fallen in the past three months to trade around $90 a barrel, from about $120. But they have risen sharply in recent sessions on expectations for the OPEC+ cuts. Brent crude futures on Wednesday slipped 0.46% to $91.40 a barrel. WTI crude was down 0.53% to $81.02 a barrel.Crude prices could hit $100 a barrel if OPEC+ cuts production as expected, Kpler energy analyst Viktor Katona told Insider Monday.Read more: OPEC is mulling an oil-production cut of more than 1 million barrels per day, and the move is exactly the opposite of what the US wants right nowRead the original article on Business Insider]"

San Francisco-based Twitter said it received the letter and intends to close the deal at the agreed-upon price, without commenting specifically on how it will respond to Musk.For Twitter, proceeding with Musk’s plan augurs a future under a mercurial billionaire who has spent months publicly criticizing its management, questioning its value and changing his mind. It also means that his contested claims -- that Twitter was lying about which percentage of users were bots, for instance -- are not likely to be scrutinized in a court of law.Twitter shares fell 0.6% in premarket trading after closing 22% higher at $52 in New York on Tuesday.Read More: Twitter Dips Further Below Musk Offer; Analysts See Deal ClosingMusk had been trying for months to end his contract to acquire Twitter, signed in April. The billionaire began showing signs of buyer’s remorse shortly after the deal was announced, alleging that Twitter had misled him about the size of its user base and the prevalence of automated accounts known as bots.Musk formally quit the accord in July and Twitter sued him in Delaware Chancery Court to force him to go forward with the purchase. A trial had been scheduled to begin Oct. 17. The judge in Delaware on Tuesday asked both sides to come back to her with a proposal on how the case can now proceed. The options include having Twitter seek to dismiss the case or have her continue to retain jurisdiction until the deal closes, said a person familiar with the matter.Story continuesIn the letter, Musk’s attorneys wrote that he and his supporters “intend to proceed to closing of the transaction contemplated by the April 25, 2022, merger agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.” The plan is also contingent on him lining up the necessary debt financing and the court issuing “an immediate stay of the action.” It’s a tough time for banks to sell debt. With yields at multiyear highs, banks led by Morgan Stanley could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars of losses on the unsecured portion alone, should they attempt to unload it to investors.Musk later tweeted that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk has said he wants Twitter to be more like TikTok and WeChat, with many more highly engaged users.In the run-up to the planned Delaware proceedings, lawyers for both sides have fired cannonades of subpoenas at each other aimed at teasing out testimony and evidence. Musk’s side needed to demonstrate that Twitter violated the terms of the deal. Twitter alleged that Musk used the bots issue as a pretext for backing out a deal he no longer found economically sound.Musk’s legal team was getting the sense that the case was not going well, as Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick sided repeatedly with Twitter in pretrial rulings, according to one person familiar. Even with the late emergence of a Twitter whistle-blower who alleged executives weren’t forthcoming on security and bot issues, there were concerns Musk’s side would not be able to prove a material adverse effect, the legal standard required to exit the contract.Inside Twitter on Tuesday, many employees were sitting through 2023 planning presentations when the news first started to circulate, according to multiple sources. Presenters did not acknowledge the news, which staffers saw spreading on their own social network. Many employees have opposed the idea of working for Musk, who has been openly mocked and criticized on internal Slack channels since the deal was signed.In an internal memo Tuesday to Twitter staff, viewed by Bloomberg News, General Counsel Sean Edgett thanked workers for their patience as the company works through the legal issues. “I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates,” he wrote. Trading of Twitter shares was halted after the news broke and didn’t resume until after the company confirmed receipt of Musk’s letter.Twitter shareholders voted Sept. 13 to accept the buyout offer as Musk submitted it. The company said at the time that 98.6% of the votes cast were in favor of the deal. Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder, didn’t vote at all, according to two people familiar with his decision. Musk owned almost 10% of Twitter -- more than 73 million shares -- when he agreed to acquire the company.Musk was scheduled to answer questions about the deal in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 6-7, according to a court filing Tuesday. Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal was scheduled to sit down for his deposition Monday.The case is Twitter v.

It’s been a wild ride for all involved, but after several fits and starts, the company is finally in the hands of the tech billionaire who also runs Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Here’s the timeline of how it came together.Most Read from BloombergTwitter Now Asks Some Fired Workers to Please Come BackPutin’s Ukraine War Is Entering a Terrifying New PhaseUkraine Latest: US and Russia Discussed Containing War, WSJ SaysLawyer Suing Twitter Over Layoffs Says Musk Trying to ComplyHouston Mogul’s $75 Million Win on Astros Hits Caesars HardestJan. 31: Musk starts building his stakeThe year begins with Musk quietly acquiring Twitter shares. By March 14, he accumulates over a 5% stake, the point at which he’s supposed to disclose the activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission — a misstep that later would trigger a shareholder lawsuit.March 24: Musk starts criticizing Twitter, on TwitterIn late March, with his stake still secret, Musk begins lobbing criticism at the company: “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he tweets on March 24. “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?” he asks on March 25. “Is a new platform needed?” Musk says on March 26. “Am giving serious thought to this.”April 4: Musk’s stake becomes public, and he’s invited to join Twitter’s boardIt becomes known that Musk is Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with more than 9% of the company. His filing lists him as a passive investor, but he’s been actively tweeting about changes to the business. That includes polling users on whether they want an edit button, which would allow people to change tweets after they’ve been published. By end of day, Twitter invites Musk to join the board contingent on him not owning more than 14.9% of the company’s stock.Story continuesApril 5: Musk becomes an active investorIn the morning, several of Twitter’s board members take to the platform to congratulate Musk on his decision to join their ranks. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal tweets that the company and Musk have been chatting for weeks. Later that day, Musk refiles his disclosure to classify himself as an active investor, after indicating that he would accept a seat on the social network’s board.April 9: Musk rejects the board seatMusk rejects the offer to join the board, and Twitter holds the news for roughly 36 hours while waiting to see if he will change his mind. He spends the weekend tweeting more suggestions for the business, like converting Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter “since no one shows up anyway” and charging for user verification, a service that has been free and reserved for notable figures.April 10: Twitter announces Musk is not joining the boardOn Sunday, Agrawal sends a note to employees about Musk not joining the board and later tweets it publicly. Neither Agrawal or Musk give a reason for the reversal.April 11: Speculation aboundsMusk files an amended disclosure with the SEC. He can now purchase as many shares as he wants. Without a board seat, he doesn’t have to act in the best interest of Twitter shareholders. Within the company, which doesn’t have a founder with majority control like other tech giants, employees are “super stressed” and concerned that this is only the beginning of the turmoil.April 14: Musk offers to buy the whole companyIn an SEC filing and accompanying tweet, Musk says he would buy out stockholders in a cash deal then valued at $43 billion to take Twitter private. The offer is $54.20 a share, a 54% premium over the price when he started building his stake in January. Morgan Stanley is brought in to advise on the bid, which Musk describes as his “best and final” offer.April 15: Twitter adopts ‘poison pill’ to ward off Musk takeoverTo thwart Musk, Twitter launches a so-called poison pill, which is a rights plan that allows shareholders to purchase shares at a discount if any shareholder exceeds 15% ownership. It’s a tactic that would effectively dilute the billionaire’s stake. The company says that the intention of the plan is to ensure that anyone taking control through open-market accumulation will pay all shareholders an appropriate premium. Twitter begins to field interest from other parties, and is advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, among others. Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, a friend of Musk, acknowledges in a tweet that as a public company Twitter has always been for sale.April 16: ‘Twitter’s board owns almost no shares’In a flurry of tweets about the potential deal, Musk says, “With Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares,” so its economic interests are not aligned with shareholders. Dorsey replies, “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company.” Dorsey is scheduled to leave the board once his term expires at the next shareholder meeting on May 25.April 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in fundingMusk says he’s secured $46.5 billion in funding. A filing with the SEC shows that he has $25.5 billion in debt financing from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, including margin loans backed by his equity stake in Tesla and $21 billion in equity financing from himself. But whether the billionaire will sell part of his stake in one of his prized companies to acquire Twitter remains to be seen.April 25: Twitter agrees to be boughtTwitter yields to Musk’s original offer of $54.20 a share. The transaction, valued at about $44 billion, will take the company private. Musk says he will prioritize free speech on the site, make its algorithms open-source, eliminate spam and add new features. Twitter says it expects the deal to close this year.April 29: Musk sells Tesla stockMusk discloses an additional $4.5 billion worth of Tesla stock sales in new regulatory filings, followed by disclosures of 4.4 million shares sold the two prior days, bringing the total to around $8.5 billion that he’s disposed of in the process of buying Twitter. Musk has now sold about $25 billion worth of stock in the electric-car maker during the last six months.May 4: Billionaire backers pony up additional fundsMusk raises an additional $7.1 billion to fund the transaction. Backers include Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, who puts up $1 billion. The bid also gets $800 million from Sequoia Capital, $700 million from Vy Capital and $500 million from Binance, with more than a dozen others contributing as well, according to company filings. Musk secures a pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who agrees to roll over his nearly 35 million Twitter shares, worth about $1.9 billion at $54.20 per share.May 6: Plans for Twitter revealedIn a pitch deck presented to investors and seen by the New York Times, Musk lays out aggressive growth plans for Twitter, including aiming to quintuple revenue $26.4 billion by 2028, from $5 billion last year, and increasing users to 931 million from 217 million. To accomplish this, he plans to expand the company’s negligible payments business currently used for tipping creators, and increase it to $15 million in revenue by 2023 and $1.3 billion by 2028. The deck also reveals plans to cut the company’s reliance on advertising to less than 50% of revenue, further develop a subscription product and prepare for fluctuating headcount.May 10: Trump ban to be liftedMusk confirms that he would reverse Twitter’s ban on former US president Donald Trump once he’s the owner.“I would reverse the permanent ban,” he says at a Financial Times conference. “Perma bans just fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter as a town square where everyone can voice their opinion.”“My opinion, and Jack Dorsey I want to be clear shares this opinion, is that we should not have permanent bans,” Musk says. Dorsey tweets his agreement, and both men add caveats that illegal behavior or spam wouldn’t be allowed.May 12: Hiring freeze goes into effect and key executives departCEO Agrawal announces a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts amid the state of uncertainty over the acquisition. Two of Twitter’s top leaders also depart: Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue product. Beykpour tweets, “Interrupting my paternity leave to share some final @twitter-related news: I’m leaving the company after over 7 years.” He adds: “The truth is this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision. Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.”According to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, the company is halting hiring and may rescind outstanding offers. The company is also pulling back on costs such as travel, consulting and marketing. Agrawal says global events, including the war in Ukraine and supply-chain crunch, have hurt Twitter’s business, but broad job cuts aren’t yet planned.May 13: Musk hits the brakesWith bots surfacing as a deal breaker, Musk tweets, “Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.” This sends Twitter’s stock plummeting. A few hours later he tweets that he is “still committed” to the acquisition and is waiting on confirmation that fake accounts on the social-media platform contributes to less than 5% of its users.May 16: Musk and Agrawal have it out...on TwitterIn a tweetstorm, Agrawal explains that measuring spam accounts is complicated because some are actually real humans even if they look like spam, and vice versa. Twitter also allows bots on the service, so simply setting up an automated account is not against the rules. Musk is not impressed with Agrawal’s response and suggests calling users to verify their accounts. He then replies to Agrawal with a poop emoji.May 17: Musk threatens to pull outMusk declares that he won’t proceed with his takeover plan unless the social-media giant can prove bots make up fewer than 5% of its users. The comment stokes speculation that Musk may be trying to lower the price. But Twitter’s board says it plans to enforce the $44 billion agreement, and that directors have already voted to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve Musk’s $54.20-a-share offer.If the deal falls apart due to financing issues, Musk would have to pay a $1 billion breakup fee, but he can’t walk away for just any reason. The merger agreement includes a specific performance provision that allows Twitter to force Musk to consummate the takeover, according to a securities filing. That could mean that, should the deal end up in court, Twitter might secure an order obligating Musk to complete the merger rather than winning monetary compensation for any violations of it.July 8: Musk backs out of deal, citing ‘spam bots’Musk backs out of the deal to buy the platform, saying in a regulatory filing that the company has made “misleading representations” over the number of so-called spam bots on the service. He also says in a letter to Twitter that the company hasn’t “complied with its contractual obligations” to provide information about how to assess how prevalent the bots are on the social-media service and argues that Twitter has failed to operate its normal course of business.July 12: Twitter sues MuskTwitter files suit in Delaware Chancery Court to compel Musk to complete the deal. In the lawsuit, Twitter says, “Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” Musk then countersues Twitter, arguing the company misled investors and the SEC and was “frantically closing the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud,” according to the filing reviewed by Bloomberg.Sept. 29: Private texts revealedAs part of the lawsuit slated to go to trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court, Musk’s private text messages become public, revealing how the deal came together, including early conversations with Dorsey.There are also a flurry of messages from industry insiders who offer suggestions on who should be CEO. Investor Bill Lee suggests Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital. Steve Jurvetson pushes for the former chief business officer of Uber Technologies Inc., Emil Michael. And investor Jason Calacanis texts, “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.”Oct. 4: Musk revives $44 billion takeover bidTo avoid a courtroom fight, Elon Musk revives his bid for Twitter at the original offer price of $54.20 a share. Twitter shares climb as much as 23% after resuming trading following a halt on the news.Oct. 6: It’s do or dieDelaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick agrees to pause the court case to give the two parties a chance to complete the deal. A hard deadline is set for agreement to be reached by Oct. 28 at 5 p.m., or a trial will resume in November.Oct. 27: Musk buys TwitterWith the court deadline approaching, Musk finalizes the deal and takes possession of Twitter.His first act is to fire the executive leadership that thwarted him, including CEO Agrawal.As he tweets plans for unbanning accounts and charging for user verification, there are murmurings of another wave of Twitter quitters. General Motors Co. pauses ads. Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes tweets, “Not hanging around for whatever Elon has planned. Bye.”The deal is done, ending Twitter’s nine-year run as a public company. But with Musk poised to cut jobs and shake up the company’s business model, the upheaval may just be beginning.(Updates with closing of deal.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEl Salvador’s $300 Million Bitcoin ‘Revolution’ Is Failing MiserablyUS Housing Hit by Spiraling Mortgage Rates as Inflation PersistsYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid Mystery©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

42,19005077-353a-3c2d-9018-bfae76d11269,OMC,2022-10-05,Introducing the Culture Gap - New FleishmanHillard Report Uncovers Generation Divided and Explores How to Bridge Society's Divisions,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/introducing-culture-gap-fleishmanhillard-report-140000294.html,1664892000,STORY,['OMC'],"[This Global research report, backed by renowned brand expert and Columbia University lecturer Kai D. Wright, points to new cultural dividers in society causing brands need to rebuild and readjust.With global respondents split on brands needing to be bold and brave (52%) versus sensible and conservative (54%), the time for brands to pay attention and act is now. ST. LOUIS, Oct. 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Brands are finding themselves paralyzed in a landscape driven apart by culture wars, but new research released today by FleishmanHillard shows businesses must be braver in bridging these issues to stay culturally relevant without losing authenticity to consumers.The latest study from FleishmanHillard, Authentic Insights: The Culture Gap, Introducing Gen D, made in partnership with Columbia University's Kai D. Wright, puts cultural issues at the heart of the research report to further understand how brands can move out of paralysis on today's most pertinent topics and find a path forward in closing the current cultural divides in society.The study unpacks a new generation, Generation Divided (Gen D), at a time when people aren't just feeling divided within communities; they are feeling a divide within themselves. The context of a polarized world has been well established in recent times, with clear societal divisions increasingly influencing both business and personal lives. The state of divide around us has a clear impact on our internal state of flux and on what's right and what's not. Sixty percent of consumers today feel that people are compromising their true self by being too politically correct, and almost half (47%) believe it's becoming more difficult to get along with people who hold contrasting views. Generation Divided was uncovered by FleishmanHillard's unique research screening process that moved away from the standard demographic splits based on age and gender. Instead, it examined a range of factors including socioeconomic indicators, gender identity and religious and political beliefs to ensure that all aspects of humanity are reflected within the research.Story continues""In this woke, people power era, action and words are the minimum expectations for ongoing connections to your business and brand,"" said Candace Peterson, global head of Brand at FleishmanHillard. ""We find many brands in a state of arrested development, unsure of how to move forward amid so much cultural division and so much reputation at stake. The latest study from our Culture Unit at FleishmanHillard explores this tension. It spotlights not just how companies should view culture, but how these cultural divides can be used as a springboard to strengthen their brand reputation and remain, or even become, culturally relevant.""Key survey findings include:While 67% of respondents wanted brands to be empathetic, 78% felt being authentic was even more important.More than half (55%) think brands should release fewer upgrades/new products over the next year.Although 61% of consumers would choose an employer based on its willingness to take a stand on societal issues, almost as many also agree that employers often fake their interest in DE&amp;I and other societal issues (55%).""Ultimately, brand and business leaders must prepare to be uncomfortable — ready to shift the practices, processes and policies of producing, releasing and evaluating efficacy of work,"" said Columbia University lecturer Kai D. Wright. ""No one leader knows the best path for each community, and no business team belongs to every global culture. Continual learning is inherent in leadership to be culturally relevant. Through this report and study, we explore the drivers fueling a growing cultural divide between communities; understand how to anticipate, thrive in and accelerate through the ever-constant of 'change'; and dive into the role that brands and businesses play in bridging the cultural gap to solve societal issues.""The Authentic Insights: The Culture Gap, Introducing Gen D report was developed by FleishmanHillard's Culture Unit, a global team of macro culture strategists that enable brands to be brave and take action whilst being thoughtful of the cause they are communicating. The report comes in the wake of the Unit's industry-first partnerships with the inclusive talent agency Zebedee, and the United Nations' Unstereotype Alliance. Ongoing partnerships such as these create authentic behavioral change that enable FleishmanHillard to help shape a better world.The research was conducted by FleishmanHillard TRUE Global Intelligence, the agency's in-house research practice, together with an accredited third-party vendor, which surveyed 5,000 adults – 18 years old and older – across the U.S., UK, China, Germany and Brazil (1,000 per country). The research survey was designed to move away from standard demographic splits based on age and gender, and instead looked at communities through commonalities on a range of factors, including socioeconomic indicators, gender identity, religious beliefs and political leanings to ensure all conditions of humanity are reflected within the research. The survey consisted of two separate 25-question surveys, which were answered online by respondents September 15-20.The report is available to read and download at https://fh.pr/AuthenticInsights2022.About FleishmanHillard  FleishmanHillard specializes in public relations, reputation management, public affairs, brand marketing, digital strategy, social engagement and content strategy.

BALL will provide its aluminum bottles with pure, premium filtered water at the site using the Boomerang Bottling System, thus supplying the bottled water in a reusable package. This partnership furthers BALL’s ambition to deliver new, innovative and sustainable solutions for customers.Boomerang Water provides the world's first on-site, micro-bottling solution, which is an alternative to plastic water bottles. Its zero-waste system washes, rinses, sanitizes, fills and caps reusable glass or aluminum bottles with pure, premium filtered water at the point of use, thereby maintaining purity and minimizing waste. The system can wash, fill and cap more than 3,000 bottles of fresh, premium water per eight-hour shift. Its cutting-edge technology promises both cost-effectiveness and sustainability as benefits.With this initiative, Boomerang Water hopes to change the current water-bottling practices. It is advocating the end of single-use plastics to eliminate waste and carbon emissions discharged from manufacturing and transporting traditional, disposable bottles.This system is ideal for venues where used bottles can be easily reclaimed, such as resorts, cruise ships, convention centers, corporate and university campuses, military and government bases, and industrial and manufacturing facilities. Also, rather than disposing of the bottles at the end of their shelf life, BALL and Boomerang Water plan to recycle the same into new bottles within 60 days.Customers are increasingly favoring aluminum cans, bottles and cups as those are infinitely recyclable and economically viable. BALL has been expanding its production capacity for a while to capitalize on this demand trend. The alliance between BALL and Boomerang Water comes at an opportune time when sustainability is gaining utmost importance among consumers.Story continuesAccording to reports, in recent years, 85% of consumers opted for sustainable choices while making their purchases. Ball Corporation and its other packaging peers like Amcor Plc  AMCR, Sonoco Products SON, and Sealed Air SEE (to name a few) are thus intensifying their focus on bringing sustainable packaging solutions to consumers.Amcor set the trend as the first global packaging company to pledge to develop all its packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025. AMCR doubled the use of post-consumer recycled resin in the last two years.Sonoco intends to achieve sustainability goals with a significant reduction of carbon emission and provide customers with environmentally-friendly products. SON aims to lower the Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% within 2030 and the Scope 3 carbon emission by 13.5%.Sonoco acquired Ball Metalpack in January 2022 for a cash payment of $1.35 billion.

47,2a62f027-fd6c-34d3-997f-8424cc9993ff,RL,2022-10-05,Strategic Growth Plans to Aid Ralph Lauren (RL) Amid High Costs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategic-growth-plans-aid-ralph-142002618.html,1664893202,STORY,['RL'],"[Ralph Lauren Corporation RL has been gaining from brand strength, solid demand, and expansion across all channels and regions. Also, the company witnessed broad-based strength across all three regions. This led to impressive first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it reported the eighth straight earnings beat and the sixth consecutive revenue surprise.Net revenues grew 8% year over year to $1,490.6 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 13% from the prior-year quarter. The metric gained from solid growth across all regions.Consequently, management expects fiscal 2023 year-over-year cc revenue growth in the high-single digits on a 52-week comparable basis. The operating margin is forecast to be 14-14.5% on a cc basis. Notably, RL reported an operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the last year. The gross margin, on a 52-week comparable basis, is envisioned to expand 30-50 bps on a cc basis, driven by solid AUR growth and positive product mix, more than offsetting higher freight and product cost inflation.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of 11% on a cc basis. It anticipates an operating margin of 15.4-15.7% on a cc basis.That said, let’s delve deeper into other factors aiding the stock.Factors Narrating RL’s Growth StoryRalph Lauren remains on track with expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, the digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The global digital ecosystem continued to witness robust growth, recording year-over-year low-double-digit revenue growth and revenue growth of more than 80% on a two-year basis. On a cc basis, Ralph Lauren’s digital ecosystem sales grew in the mid-single digits. This was driven by strength across owned and wholesale digital channels globally.The company introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including India and Israel, in the fiscal first quarter. Revenues for the company’s owned digital sites rose year over year in the high-single digits, driven by strong full-price selling, stemming from a positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition. New customers in its digital sites grew 70% from the pre-pandemic levels.Also, its online search grew year over year in the high teens, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Polo shirts and spring luxury campaigns. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app during the holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.Other notable companies in the Consumer Discretionary space, which continue to perform well on the online front, are as follows:lululemon’s LULU e-commerce business delivered an impressive performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, with revenues increasing 53% on a three-year CAGR basis. The company continues to strengthen omni-channel capabilities such as curbside pickups, same day deliveries and BOPUS (buy online pick up in store). lululemon is enhancing its mobile app to offer the curbside pickup service and train its store associates to help customers speed up transactions.For fiscal 2022, LULU’s sales view assumes e-commerce growth in the low to mid-20s range relative to that reported in fiscal 2021, and compares with a high-teens to low-20s range expected earlier.Crocs’ CROX continued progress in expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities bodes well. We note that CROX’s digital sales advanced 21% year over year in the second quarter, driven by strong traffic and solid demand.Increased focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms aided digital sales. Gains from strategic collaborations, influencer campaigns, and digital and social marketing efforts remained upsides.Carter’s CRI e-commerce business has been performing well, driven by expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store and ship from store, along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores.CRI’s mobile app is also performing well. Carter’s anticipates e-commerce penetration to rise to 42% by 2024.Coming to Ralph Lauren, its average unit retail (AUR) increased 8% for first-quarter fiscal 2023, marking the 21st straight AUR growth, driven by continued momentum. The company has been navigating through the ongoing inflationary environment, driven by a favorable product mix and strong pricing power.It expects to continue delivering AUR above its annual long-term target of low to mid-single-digit AUR growth through fiscal 2023, which will help mitigate mid to high-single-digit cost inflation. The company’s strategy of product elevation, acquisition of new full-priced consumers, and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth. This is likely to continue aiding gross margin growth.The company recently announced an update on its strategic growth plan — ""Next Great Chapter: Accelerate."" The ""Next Great Chapter: Accelerate"" focuses on delivering sustainable long-term growth and value creation. Through the accelerated plan, the company is likely to continue building on its brand position; expand its distinctive, timeless products and experiences across multiple categories; and increase its presence in key cities across the globe.Management outlined the financial growth targets for the next three years from a base of fiscal 2022 through 2025. For the next three years, the company anticipates a compound annual revenue growth rate of mid to high-single digits in cc. It expects the cc operating margin to exceed the revenue guidance, expanding to at least 15% by the end of fiscal 2025. Growth is likely to be driven by modest gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, along with continued investments in the company’s long-term strategic priorities.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeRalph Lauren has been reeling under elevated freight expenses and higher marketing investments. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, Ralph Lauren's adjusted gross profit margin contracted 180 bps year over year on a reported basis and 80 bps on a cc basis to 68%. The company’s adjusted operating income was $190 million, up 18% from $231 million in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted 410 bps year over year to 12.7%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 in the fiscal first quarter declined 18% from the prior-year quarter’s $2.29.For fiscal 2023, the operating margin is forecast to be 14-14.5% at cc. Notably, it reported an operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the last year. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company anticipates an operating margin of 15.4-15.7% at cc, which includes the negative impacts of higher freight and marketing expenses. The gross margin is predicted to contract 40-80 bps year over year at cc due to rising freight and product costs, offsetting continued AUR growth.Unfavorable currency impacts remain concerning. Adverse currency rates hurt net revenues by 510 bps in first-quarter fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, the company expects adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 600 bps. On a 53-week comparable basis, the metric is likely to be hurt by an unfavorable currency of 100 bps. The operating margin is expected to be affected by 180 bps of unfavorable currency. The gross margin is forecasted to be negatively impacted by 150 bps of unfavorable currency. For the fiscal second quarter, the unfavorable currency is likely to negatively impact revenues by 750 bps, the gross margin by 190 bps and the operating margin by 240 bps.ConclusionWe believe that the above-mentioned upsides will likely work well for RL, helping it counter cost-related hurdles and currency woes.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Mr. Hohn was born in 1966 in Addlestone, Surrey, in a working-class family. His father was a car mechanic, and his mother was a legal secretary. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in accounting and business economics from the University of Southampton. On being advised by one of his tutors at the University of Southampton, Mr. Hohn applied to the Harvard Business School (HBS) for an MBA. At HBS, he graduated among the top 5% of his batch, becoming one of the Baker Scholars, the institution’s highest award for academic achievement. He worked at multiple noted PE and hedge funds in New York and London for a few years before setting up TCI Fund Management in 2003.TCI takes a long-term, value-oriented approach while investing and strongly focuses on environmental, social and governance issues. It is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, with over $50 billion in assets under management.Mr. Hohn is also a well-known philanthropist, having donated billions of dollars to charitable causes over the years. He is a founder and major supporter of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a UK-based charity that works to improve the lives of children in developing countries. He has also given large sums of money to educational causes and environmental causes.Mr. Hohn is well known on Wall Street and in the financial center of London for his aggressive negotiating style.

(NYSE:V) continued to be among TCI Fund Management’s top 10 stock picks at the end of Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris HohnChris HohnOur MethodologyAt Insider Monkey, we cover the portfolios of 895 hedge funds, closely tracking the stocks they buy and sell. We selected the ten stocks discussed in this article based on the 13F regulatory filing submitted by TCI Fund Management with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30. These are the top ten picks of Hohn's fund, according to its second quarter portfolio.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $172,633,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was the only stock among its top stock picks in which  TCI Fund Management initiated a new stake during Q2. Founded in 1967, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is among the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the world. Due to macro uncertainty and supply chain issues the semiconductor industry has been facing in the last few quarters, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) recently got featured in Insider Monkey’s list of 5 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Uncertainty Grows.One of the major reasons TCI Fund Management decided to buy the stock during the second quarter could be the drastic decline it has suffered this year. Having lost close to 48% of its value year-to-date, Applied Materials, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock currently trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of only 10.95.On September 28, analysts at Barclays reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while reducing their price target to $85 from $95, which represents almost no potential upside from where the stock is currently trading.9. Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $940,029,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.97%    Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Although TCI Fund Management reduced its stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) by 10% during the second quarter, the stock’s popularity among smart money investors saw a massive jump during that time. From just 21 hedge funds among those covered by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) at the end of March, the number jumped to 32 at the end of June. Funds that initiated a stake in the company during the second quarter included billionaire Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Ken Heebner’s Capital Growth Management, and Jinghua Yan’s TwinBeech Capital.Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP), as the name suggests, is based in Boston, Massachusetts and is currently the country’s largest publicly-held developer and owner of Class A office properties. It focuses on five major property markets in the country: Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC. On September 20, Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) announced that it had acquired a six-story life sciences property with a total area of 271,000 square feet adjacent to Kendall Center from Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). The gross purchase price of this deal was around $592 million, and Biogen has leased the property back from Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) and will continue to occupy the premise until April 2028.8. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $1,120,178,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Railroad major Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) stock seems to be following the trajectory of a roller coaster this year. Having started the year near the $200 level, it reached its lifetime high of $278.94 in May, but has pared all that gain as it currently trades flat year-to-date. Why following smart money can reap rich rewards for ordinary investors can be gauged from how smart money has played this stock. Between mid-2017 and the first quarter of this year, when the stock rose from $100 levels to $250 levels, hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) climbed from 49 to 90. However, that number fell all the way down to 65 in just one quarter.On September 15, executives at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and other railroad majors breathed a sigh of relief. After many months of negotiations, US railway workers and companies finally reached an agreement averting a potential strike that could have caused another logistical nightmare like what we saw post-COVID. Out of the 19 analysts on Wall Street who currently cover Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) 12 have a ‘Hold’ rating on it with a consensus price target of $243.57, implying a 22.6% potential upside from the stock’s last closing price.7. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,242,721,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 7.09%                Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is the oldest stock pick of TCI Fund Management that still finds a presence in the fund’s 13F portfolio. TCI Fund Management had first reported initiating a stake in the ratings and analysis company in a regulatory filing for the last quarter of 2012. During Q2, TCI Fund Management upped its stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) by 14%. Other funds covered by us that also increased their holdings in the company during the same period included billionaire D. E. Shaw’s fund D E Shaw, which boosted its stake by 166% to 60,674 shares, and Dev Kantesaria’s Valley Forge Capital, which upped its holdings by 8% to 1.16 million shares.For its third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is scheduled to report its earnings on October 28. The current consensus among analysts is that the company would declare a GAAP EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $1.4 billion for that period. On September 27, analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while upping their price target on it slightly to $288 from $283, representing a potential upside of 16.8% from the stock’s last closing price.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,955,450,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 9.35%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Like Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another stock in which TCI Fund Management has held a stake for a long time and boosted its holding further – by 29% – during the second quarter. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) have been among the most consistent compounding stocks over the past several years. However, among funds tracked by Insider Monkey, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) ranks way ahead in popularity when compared to Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO).In its second quarter investors letter published recently, Investment management company Ave Maria had this to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI):“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a data-driven financial services company with leading franchises in the areas of data and analytics, credit rating, commodity insights and indices. S&amp;P Global benefits from several secular trends including the disintermediation of banks, a shift to passive investing, and an increased focus on ESG, Climate &amp; Energy Transition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:11 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio10 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks14 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

In 2020, Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp, citing disagreements over editorial content at the company founded by his father, a conservative media mogul.Fox News, a television network spun out of News Corp., has been a fierce critic of Biden's presidency and amplified false claims that former President Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election. The station is being sued by Dominion Voting Systems for defamation over election coverage.In recent weeks, Biden has brought in millions of dollars for Democratic candidates, party officials say, contributing to a record level of fundraising in a midterm year.He has spoken at a wide array of venues that include a tent filled with donors behind a house in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Manhattan living room of mathematician Henry Laufer, where guests sat listening to Biden in their socks to avoid soiling the carpet.Biden remains a big draw among wealthy Democrats and has boosted fund-raising efforts in spite of lackluster job approval numbers. The events also aim to convince deep-pocketed Democrats that Biden, 79, is the right candidate for a 2024 presidential run despite his age.Story continuesWhile there remain questions as to whether Biden will seek a second term, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Biden ally, told his National Action Network staff recently that Biden told him he does plan to run again in 2024, NBC News reported on Monday.""I'm going to do it again,"" Biden told Sharpton, NBC News said.An official with the Democratic National Committee said that with Biden's assistance, it has raised a midterm record $271 million during the current election cycle and more than $107 million so far this year, ""the most at this point in any year.""

Here are those reasons, with analysis from us at Yahoo Finance.""Treasury yields have backed off their recent highs. Two-years are down to 4.10% from the 4.32% highs on September 26th. Ten years are at 3.64%, well off the September 27 high of 3.96%."" That has put a bid under often leadership names in tech such as AMD, Amazon, and Apple.""Lower Treasury yields have stabilized currency markets. The euro is almost back to par with the dollar at 0.9983. The British pound has rallied from its V-bottom low on September 26 at $1.07, back to $1.15."" The U.S. dollar has eased off its recent highs this week, supporting share prices of multinationals such as Caterpillar and Microsoft.""Tuesday's JOLTS report suggests U.S. labor markets are seeing their first real signs of cooling."" U.S. manufacturing data earlier this week also showed an easing in economic activity and pricing pressure, spurring markets on the hopes the Fed would cool the pace of rate hikes sooner.""U.S. Q3 corporate earnings season starts next week, and estimates have come down enough (-6.6% since June 30) that companies should be able to beat Street numbers by a few percent."" Be careful with that one in light of recent dreadful financial warnings from FedEx, Nike, and Hasbro.""The next Fed meeting is not until November 2, so markets can focus on earnings rather than monetary policy."" Hawkish rhetoric from Fed members last week tanked the market, so less of their musings could bring further short-term relief to markets.Story continuesThat being said, investors remain on high alert for the resumption of selling given the precarious state of global economies and inflation-fighting tones among central bankers.The Federal Reserve remains the straw that stirs the drink in global markets as it continues a mission to stomp out inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates, which has set the pace for fellow central banks. That mission was reinforced in the past week by the tough-sounding commentary from various Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Lael Brainard.People ride in the ""Red Force"" roller coaster during the inauguration of Ferrari Land, at PortAventura resort, south of Barcelona, Spain April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYWall Street is now bracing for a policy mistake from central bankers.""We are increasingly worried about central banks making a policy error, and of new geopolitical tail risks,"" Marko Kolanovic, a top JPMorgan strategist, wrote in a new note to clients.The hawkish tone from the Fed has rippled across an array of asset markets, from the surging U.S. dollar to rising mortgage rates that are nearing 7%.And despite the strong start to October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remain mired in double-digit percentage declines for the year. Emerging markets remain under considerable pressure as well.""Our core view for choppy markets, up in quality and defensive positioning over the next six to 12 months, remains intact,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner warned in a note to clients. ""This global tightening cycle is set to weigh on economic growth well into 2023 given that monetary policy works with long and variable lags. Thus, even if the Federal Reserve (Fed) pivots or inflation softens in the fourth quarter, which may energize a risk-on rally, it likely does not change the downward trajectory of the economy and challenging market backdrop over the medium term.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Michael Pachter is the managing director of equity research at Wedbush. Nice to see you, sir. So how significant a release is this for a relatively struggling sector, as well as Activision, probably most importantly?MICHAEL PACHTER: Well, Activision very likely isn't going to be a standalone company in another few months, so not significant for Microsoft. Pretty significant for Activision. I think what actually matters here is that they took the ""Overwatch"" brand, and they had previously issued it as a $60 purchase. And they've converted it into a free-to-play game. And we don't know if that's permanent, but we know that the launch right now is free.It's a beta, and the servers are completely jammed. So there's a wait just to get into a queue to be matched up with somebody and get into a game. It's a several hour wait, it looks like. So I would guess at least 10 million people are trying to play right now and aren't being particularly successful. And the difference between a $60 game and a free-to-play game is you don't have to pony up the cash, which means instead of selling 10 million units or so, they'll probably end up with 100 million players who are going to check it out and try it.And that speaks volumes about how Activision has evolved as a company. They used to want to charge you for everything. They saw the success of ""Fortnite,"" which is free-to-play. They saw the success of ""Apex Legends"" from EA, which is free-to-play. And I think they're starting to think we can do this, too. They did it with ""Call of Duty, Warzone."" I think they're trying it now with ""Overwatch."" So it's a big deal. If Activision and Microsoft don't end up combined, it's going to probably drive incremental $400 or $500 million of revenue a year going forward. So it's a big deal.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Michael, highly recommend you check out some of the memes and GIFs of those millions of people waiting to play. Twitter is entertaining right now, as far as ""Overwatch 2."" But I think you answered my question there about the future of this Activision merger, Microsoft acquisition. They launched a website yesterday just basically to PR the acquisition and what it does for the gaming community. That's not generally a good sign. Why is this taking so long? And when do you think it gets approved?MICHAEL PACHTER: It warms my heart that you say GIF, which is the correct way to say it, by the way. You know, it's taking so long because the government is starting to actually do its job. And I think we had four years where government agencies got out of the way and let businesses do whatever the hell they wanted. We now have a different administration. I think the FTC is watching out for the consumer and making sure that if a combination goes through, that it doesn't result in a lowering of competition.I don't think the FTC is going to block this. So I think ultimately, the deal is going to close. But I think that the FTC and the UK Competition and Markets Authority and the EU Competition Commission are going to have to be satisfied that under Microsoft's ownership, Activision will continue to put games on the PlayStation platform, for example. And I think Microsoft will agree to that.So I think you can do things to make sure that the status quo isn't disrupted and keep consumers happy. Microsoft's not buying Activision to screw PlayStation. They're buying Activision to put Activision titles and Blizzard titles on Game Pass and drive subscriptions without requiring people to buy a console or PC. They have aspirations to be like Netflix. They're looking well beyond 25 million subscribers, and they're looking at 200 million households who can play games and pay them $15 a month. And I think it really has a chance of happening if they close the deal with Activision.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Michael, as you look at what we're seeing with PC, with mobile, as well as console action here, who are the strongest performers? Who's in the best position to take advantage of the next generation of gaming?MICHAEL PACHTER: The processing speeds on phones are getting kind of ridiculous. They're so fast. So mobile games are catching up. They're not there yet, but they're pretty good experiences. I think that most compelling is that a streaming service like a Game Pass, Google Stadia that closed down-- or was closing down at year end-- announced it last week-- and Amazon Luna, ultimately, you're not going to require any hardware. You're going to require an internet connection and a screen. You can play a console-quality game on your TV or your phone or your laptop without using the processor.So it doesn't really matter. It's all going to kind of merge together. But as far as who's best positioned to make money, the mobile publishers right now because that's the biggest market by a lot, by literally five or 10-fold. There are 3 and 1/2 billion active mobile gamers. It's crazy. Half the planet plays mobile games. And easily, 10% of them spend money, more likely 20% over the course of a year. So you've got 600 or 700 million people spending money in mobile games, as opposed to a couple hundred million people who buy console or PC games.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as you speak about this merging, obviously, Google pulling back, as you mentioned there with Stadia, but you also have Netflix trying to step up its role here. As we're seeing some of these tech companies coming into the gaming space here, do you expect more perhaps consolidation in this space? And who will be some of the likely contenders?MICHAEL PACHTER: I think that tech companies suffer from the delusion that if they're good at one thing, they can be good at everything. And so that's clearly-- that clearly was Google's problem. That's clearly Netflix's problem. Microsoft isn't quite as stupid. They failed pretty miserably with the Xbox in 2001. They did a little better with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and then a lot better with the Xbox 1 and the Xbox Series X.But they figured out that they need to really own compelling content to be good. And it took them literally 15 years to have great content. And then they went on a buying spree. They've been buying up studios, six small ones, then Bethesda, and now Activision. Netflix isn't going to do it by building one game at a time. And they're not going to do it by buying little, tiny mobile game developers. Anybody who wants to be in this business is going to have to make a splash. So the answer to your question is, yes, consolidation is likely if a big tech company decides they want to be in this.I don't think Netflix has the assets or the appetite to go spend $60, $70 billion. Amazon maybe, but they're pissing money down a hole trying to build games themselves. And they're doing a really miserable job at it. As you said, Google did a miserable job at it. So I think it's going to take a while before anybody really makes a big move.And the gem of an asset out there is Warner Brothers Interactive. You know, it's owned by Warner Brothers Discovery, which is run by a very savvy business guy in David Zaslav, who is burdened by debt and needs to raise cash. And I think if any company wants to make a move in the games industry, buy Warner Brothers Interactive. Their CEO, David Haddad, is great and would run the business perfectly for you. And then make a big bet and license DC Warner Brothers content per games. I think that's the win. That's the next asset acquisition, if anybody is serious about being in this business.DAVE BRIGGS: Keep your eye on that future acquisition. Excellent stuff from Michael Pachter from Wedbush. Thank you, sir.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Tech Stocks to Consider.Growth stocks are lagging in 2022 amid skyrocketing inflation and incessant rate hikes. As of September 30, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has lost 33% of its value year-to-date. Growth stocks have been beaten down to levels where they are presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Analyst Says: “Try To Get Great Names On Pullbacks”Senior securities analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, Barton Crocket, was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, where he discussed how investors can navigate the current market situation around tech stocks by investing in blue chip companies. He also talked about how now is an attractive entry point for long-term investors to own some of the top tech companies. According to Barton Crocket, investors “have to own tech” because “tech is the future”. Here are some comments from the analyst:“What I think we’re looking at is an environment where it’s more treacherous than really any time in many years to own tech. You’ve got valuation risk around higher interest rates, around slowing growth, you’ve got a plethora of new secular challenges…You have a lot of things to consider but you have to own tech right, so tech is the future. The question is how you navigate that, and I think you want to stick with and have some exposure to some of the best names at a reasonable valuation...”Barton Crocket was then asked if long-term investors should take up stakes in tech stocks before earnings season or wait for companies to report earnings. The analyst said that “clearly there’s increasing risk as we worry about the macro into the earnings reports” but “the stocks have reflected a lot of this already”. The analyst said that investors that are trying to time the market amid macro uncertainty can “miss an opportunity” and that they should instead “try to get great names on pullbacks”.Story continuesWhile the near term for tech stocks looks gloomy, they can become the highest returning components of your portfolio in the long term.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAPeter Lynch Chart of WBAWalgreens Boots is know for the wide reach of its drug stores. It is one of the largest retail pharmacies in the world, with sales of $132.5 billion in 2021 and 12,996 retail store locations (69% are in the U.S., 18% in the U.K. and 13% in other countries). Walgreens Boots' operations are organized into two reportable segments: United States (85% of fiscal 2021 sales) and International (15%). Beginning in 2022, Walgreens Boots will report results under three segments: United States, International and Walgreens Health.Walgreens Boots has an ~29% equity stake in AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), one of the largest drug wholesale companies in the United States. Walgreens Boots and AmerisourceBergen initiated a strategic partnership back in 2013 and has been slowly expanding this alliance. As part of this partnership, Walgreens Boots sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen. AmerisourceBergen accounts for its stake in AmerisourceBergen using equity method accounting.I have broken down the revenue and operating income by business segment in the following table:$ USD Millions (M)Revenues (millions)Operating Income (millions)Year202120202019202120202019United States112,005--5,019--International20,505--466--Retail Pharmacy USA-107,701104,532-4,0995,255Retail Pharmacy International-10,00411,462-130 M747Pharmaceutical Wholesale-23,95823,053-980939Total132,509141,663139,0465,4855,2096,941ValuationBy looking at the stock price, one would assume that all is not well with this company:Story continuesIs Walgreens Good Value Near 10-year lows?Walgreens Boots is having trouble growing its business due to increasing competition from online pharmacies and retailers and the squeeze in reimbursement rates from Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which adjudicate most prescriptions in the U.S. The question is, has the company permanently lost its competitive advantage? And if yes, has the market overreacted to the downside?The problem is reflected in its operating earnings, which are declining because of the structural reasons described above.Is Walgreens Good Value Near 10-year lows?Walgreen combined with Boots Alliance in a cross-Atlantic merger in 2014. The current structure of the company was formed on Dec. 31, 2014, after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Boots that it did not already own. The total price of the acquisition was $4.9 billion in cash and 144.3 million common shares with fair value of $10.7 billion).Since then, growth has been erratic with challenges in profitability.WBAGrowth per share over six years?Aug. 2015 to Aug. 2021Revenue per Share7.7%EBITDA per Share-4.2%EBIT per Share-8.3%Earnings per Share (Diluted)-5.1%Dividends per Share5.4%Book Value per Share-0.8%Tangible Book per Share-7.5%Operating Cash Flow per share3.0%Free Cash Flow per Share2.4%Core FCF/share2.3%In spite of growth challenges, the company currently looks extraordinarily cheap with a forward price-earnings ratio of below 7.

For the earnings per share, I assumed analyst consensus estimates, a discount rate of 8% and growth of only 2%.Is Walgreens Good Value Near 10-year lows?Business strategyNevertheless, Walgreens Boots will likely need to show some growth if this value is ever to be realized. To diversify outside the pharmacy business recently, Walgreens Boots announced a $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD, bringing its stake in the company to 63% from 30%. VillageMD currently operates 230 medical practices, 52 of which are colocated practices with Walgreens. The company expects the opening of 80 additional Village Medical at Walgreens locations in the next quarter, with 600 locations anticipated by 2025.This partnership is a promising value proposition combining primary care with the company's strategic physical store-based advantage and convenience-oriented nature (about 75% of the U.S. population lives within five miles of a Walgreens store).Also, in 2021, Walgreens Boots sold the majority of its mostly European wholesale distribution business (Alliance Healthcare) to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion ($6.275 billion cash and 2 million shares of stock). This deal should deliver synergies for both companies and help Walgreens Boots free up resources to accelerate investments in it core retail pharmacy segment, which has been facing competition from other traditional retail pharmacies and new online entrants.Dividend and margin of safetyWalgreens Boots is currently paying a 5.89% dividend yield and has also been buying backs stock (with a three-year share buyback ratio of 3.1%). The balance sheet is in good shape with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.42. The company produces excellent free cash flow. It is trying to evolve its business model from a drug store to more of integrated primary care provider, and the jury is still out whether it will succeed. However, there is a large margin of safety at the current price for the company's shares, and the dividend is there in the meantime.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, all Democrats, and independent Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, sent their request in a letter late Tuesday to Starbucks Corp Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz and its board of directors.According to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, they cited ""reports that Starbucks is engaging in illegal union-busting tactics"" and asked Starbucks to respond within a month.""We appreciate every opportunity to share the facts and address inaccuracies about our company and our partners, and we are confident in our stringent compliance with federal labor law,"" Starbucks said in response to the letter.Employees at about 245 out of Starbucks' nearly 9,000 company-owned U.S. locations have voted to unionize in just over the past year. The Senators also said in their letter that they want to see the guidance Starbucks gave to managers about how to deal with workers organizing unions and whether its spending expenditures to counter unions were listed in its tax filings. They also asked for a list of changes the Seattle-based chain has made to benefits for non-unionized employees. The company has been boosting benefits, including expanded coverage for adoption services on Monday that applied to all employees. But some other enhanced benefits, including hourly pay hikes, were given only to employees who are not in a union.

67,ac11c182-ccf6-3f03-a56f-bd8a1c77009d,SBUX,2022-10-05,Can Starbucks Bring Web3 Into the Mainstream?,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-bring-web3-mainstream-155340815.html,1664898820,STORY,['SBUX'],"[For companies looking to dip a toe into Web3 – or take a cannonball plunge – it can be difficult to know where to start. Underlying technologies such as protocols, wallets and exchanges are still nascent compared with existing financial systems. New types of tokens are introduced on a seemingly daily basis. Web3 adoption has spiked over the past few years, but is still far behind the ubiquity of Web2. The industry has a long way to go to match the functionality of current systems, particularly for consumer purchases in developed economies with stable currencies. How long will it be until using crypto for a standard consumer purchase, such as buying a cup of coffee, is a joy rather than a gimmick?Enter Starbucks. The launch of its new non-fungible token (NFT)-based reward program, Starbucks Odyssey, may bring us one step closer to making this a reality, or at least provide some suggestions of which direction to head in.Stephanie Hurder is a founding economist at Prysm Group and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. Prysm Group Associate Brian Perry-Carrera also contributed to this column.Early signs of smart designBased on recent announcements, the program is very much still a work in progress, and the full details have yet to be revealed. But from what we know so far, Starbucks has made some promising decisions that can serve as guidance for other corporate Web3 initiatives.First, Starbucks Odyssey is additive, not substitutive. Starbucks’ current reward program is arguably the most successful loyalty program in the world, with nearly 60 million rewards customers globally and 30 million in the U.S. alone. The loyalty program drives approximately 50% of all Starbucks revenue through incentivizing repeat business, upselling, and customer personalization. It would be quite a leap of faith for Starbucks to discard its wildly successful traditional rewards program and replace it with a Web3-based program, given the newness of the technology and the uncertain success of an NFT-based program. By making Starbucks Odyssey an optional, additional rewards program the firm is able to build on the existing program with complementary products, yet minimize risk to the cash cow, allowing for greater flexibility in the future should the dynamics around Web3 technology change.Story continuesSecond, the program is an organic fit with key demographics. Starbucks’ largest customer segment is millennials between the ages of 25 to 40 – comprising 50% of the company’s business – with young adults ages 18 to 24 just behind. As the Starbucks brand matures and faces challenges such as labor disputes, rising supply chain costs and labor shortages, growing and retaining this customer base will be increasingly important.See also: Why We Need to Build Web3 Differently | OpinionNFTs, while still a very new technology, appeal to this target user base. The Gen Z demographic has the most investment experience and general interest in NFTs. The second-largest demographic of those invested or interested in NFTs are millennials, which, again, bodes well for Starbucks’ key consumer segments.Third, all indications are that Starbucks will be using top-tier user interface/user experience (UI/UX) design to bridge the gap between NFT/blockchain natives and novices. Starbucks has seen tremendous success with its Mobile Order and Pay functionality, in part due to its seamless UI/UX design. For the development of the Odyssey reward program, Starbucks has partnered with Forum3, led by co-founder Adam Brotman. Prior to co-founding the Web3 loyalty startup, Brotman was the chief digital officer at Starbucks who helped lead the design of the Mobile Order and Pay system. Based on this, it seems fair to assume that Starbucks Odyssey will aim to replicate the seamless experience that customers enjoy today.Ironically, this may involve hiding many of the characteristics distinctive of Web3, at least in the short to medium term. Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Brady Brewer went as far to say: “It happens to be built on blockchain and Web3 technologies, but the customer – to be honest – may very well not even know that what they’re doing is interacting with blockchain technology.”Moving beyond marketingStarbucks Odyssey seems like a promising implementation of Web3 technology for today’s environment. However, harnessing the full potential of Web3 will require some difficult design decisions. Here are just a few that we anticipate:Managing the impact of speculation: Starbucks announced it plans to allow NFT holders to trade them in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces. As the gaming industry has learned, peer-to-peer trading of NFTs invites speculators, whose presence fundamentally alters the experience of organic users, often in a detrimental way. Starbucks will need to design marketplaces and other mechanisms to mitigate the impact of speculation and ensure the rewards program continues to provide the desired incentives.Fully harnessing underlying Web3 technology: Web3 technology – and in particular blockchain – benefits users by providing them with enhanced control of their assets. Fully harnessing these benefits requires users to have some interaction with the underlying technology, which the current Odyssey design explicitly does not do. How Starbucks will manage users’ requests for features such as self-custody – and whether users will want such features in the first place – remains to be seen.Read more: Web3 Needs In-Person Gatherings | OpinionLaunching in-demand NFTs and achieving profitability: There’s no doubt that being a leading company engaging with Web3 will provide publicity benefits to Starbucks. And certainly many consumers will be happy to receive free NFTs. But Starbucks will surely want to achieve more than this – to go beyond marketing expense and establish a profitable endeavor that generates direct and indirect revenues.The market has shown that just because there is an NFT does not mean that consumers are interested in paying for it. Starbucks faces a daunting challenge to design digital rewards that are interesting enough to its customers, particularly its Gen Z demographic, to form the basis of an effective rewards program and attract ongoing revenue streams. Achieving one or both is necessary to make this program more than just a one-off fad until the next emerging technology appears.While it’s unclear how Starbucks will tackle these obstacles, Starbucks Odyssey will nevertheless serve as a fascinating and highly informative test case for corporate implementation of Web3. Most interestingly, it provides a test of the adoption potential and limits for Web3. Given the ultimate consumer-focused company is at the helm, will we see Starbucks finally make Web3 mainstream?]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This agribusiness giant has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 31.80%.For the most recent quarter, ADM was expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share, but it reported $2.15 per share instead, representing a surprise of 22.86%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.35 per share, while it actually produced $1.90 per share, a surprise of 40.74%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for ADM lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.ADM has an Earnings ESP of +2.60% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

72,ba7d5da5-4a74-3e31-acf2-db1f62e2942e,HST,2022-10-05,3 REITs to Sell in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-sell-october-200414365.html,1664654654,STORY,"['PK', 'HST', 'PEB-PF']","[The potential for high returns and stable income streams have made real estate investment trusts, or REITs, a popular investment vehicle. However, not all REITs are created equal, especially with a potential recession hanging overhead. On today’s list, I take a look at three REITs to sell.The reasoning for my bearishness on these particular REITs stems from the fact that their area of focus — hotels and resorts — has limited upside and a lot of downside risk in the current economic environment. The lodging sector is showing signs of improvement after the pandemic, but it is not out of the woods yet.Occupancy rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and inflation and recession threaten to stop the recovery in its tracks. As consumers continue to rein in discretionary spending, they are less likely to spend money on travel, thus reducing demand for lodging.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three REITs to sell.PKPark Hotels &amp; Resorts$11.26HSTHost Hotels &amp; Resorts$15.88PEBPebblebrook Hotel Trust$14.51Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK)a Park Hotels &amp; Resorts (PK) branded destinationSource: ShutterstockPark Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:PK) is one of the largest publicly traded lodging REITs with “49 premium-branded hotels and resorts with over 30,000 rooms primarily located in prime city center and resort locations,” according to the company.The REIT has experienced a post-pandemic recovery but its latest results show occupancy levels and revenue per available room remain below 2019 levels. At the same time, operating costs are on the rise, up 54% year over year in Q2.However, the major issue the firm is facing is the crushing amount of debt it has accumulated. As of June 30, Park Hotels had $4 billion in net debt, and its interest expenses totaled $124 million in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, Park had $109 million of restricted cash on its books at the end of the second quarter. Its high debt levels are likely to limit its ability to make new investments over the next few years.Story continuesAfter falling 40% year to date and nearly 20% in September, PK is currently trading at a discount to its book value. Meanwhile, it declared a paltry dividend of 1 cent per share in Q2 for a forward annual yield of just 0.3%.I expect PK to continue to underperform as its financial situation deteriorates further, which is why it ended up on this list of REITs to sell.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Woman standing in hotel room with luggage looking at the view. Hotel stocks.Source: Boyloso / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) focuses on the luxury and upscale hotel market with 73 U.S. properties and five international properties with a total of around 42,300 rooms. Like Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, it has seen its post-pandemic recovery slow and costs rise.Revenue for the second quarter more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to nearly $1.4 billion, but it remains roughly 7% below 2019 levels. Operating costs were up 47% from a year ago and are expected to continue to rise.The REIT is saddled with a huge debt load of $4.2 billion. In recent years, it has sold several properties, but such stop-gap measures are unsustainable and could limit future profitsHST is only down 9% for the year, but it has underperformed the broader market recently. In September, shares fell 10.6% compared to an 8% loss for the S&amp;P 500. The REIT recently raised its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share, for a forward annual yield of 3%, but I’m not confident it will be able to sustain this payout if the United States’ economic troubles persist.Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB)Hotel roomSource: Dragon Images / ShutterstockLast up on today’s list of REITs to sell is Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE:PEB), which acquires and invests “in upper upscale, full-service hotel and resort properties located in or near urban markets in major United States gateway cities.” Its portfolio consists of 51 hotels and resorts with approximately 12,800 rooms.Pebblebrook has seen a recovery, with June occupancy at 73%, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. But a number of key metrics remain below 2019 levels, such as same-property room revenues and same-property EBITDA. Same-property total expenses, meanwhile, were up 63.5% year over year in the second quarter.Pebblebrook holds $2.5 billion in consolidated debt and convertible notes. While this is not an unusual amount of debt for a REIT of Pebblebrook’s size, it is concerning given the current state of the hospitality industry. If Pebblebrook is unable to increase its revenues, it may have difficulty meeting its debt obligations, which could lead to higher interest rates on future borrowings.Then there are the company’s dividend cuts to consider. Pebblebrook slashed its dividend from $1.25 per share in 2019 to a mere 4 cents a year currently. And management has said investors should not expect the dividend to normalize until at least 2023.The REIT’s 0.3% yield is unlikely to provide much comfort to shareholders who have seen PEB drop 35% this year and nearly 18% in September alone.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Today, the acceptance period is further extended, until November 4, 2022.The completion of the Offer is conditional upon, inter alia, all necessary regulatory, governmental or similar clearances, approvals, decisions and other actions from authorities or similar, including from competition authorities, being obtained, in each case on terms which, in PMHH’s opinion, are acceptable.Story continuesPMHH has obtained all regulatory, governmental or similar approvals required for the transaction, including the expiration of the waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and approval under Brazil’s merger control regime, other than merger control approval from the European Commission, which is still pending.As set forth in the press release issued by PMHH on August 9, 2022, PMHH’s assessment at the time, based on customary pre-notification discussions with the European Commission, was that the European Commission would not complete its review of the transaction before the expiry of the initial acceptance period on September 30, 2022, and that the process with the European Commission instead would be completed during October 2022. The acceptance period for the Offer was therefore extended up to and including October 21, 2022.The European Commission’s formal review was initiated on September 6, 2022. Following continued customary discussions with the European Commission, PMHH’s current assessment is that the European Commission will not complete its review of the transaction before the expiry of the extended acceptance period on October 21, 2022; as per the European Commission’s review procedure. PMHH’s current assessment is that the process with the European Commission will instead be completed late October 2022. Therefore, the Board of Directors of PMHH has resolved to further extend the acceptance period for the Offer, up to and including November 4, 2022 at 17.00 CET. Other than the extension of the acceptance period, the terms and conditions of the Offer remain unchanged.""We believe our offer remains very compelling – particularly given the current market environment,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer. ""We look forward to completing the transaction, while also continuing to actively progress on our strategic alternatives to Swedish Match, should the offer ultimately prove unsuccessful.""Settlement will be initiated as soon as PMHH announces that the conditions for the Offer have been fulfilled or when PMHH otherwise decides to complete the Offer. If such announcement takes place on November 7, 2022, at the latest, settlement is expected to be initiated around November 11, 2022.PMHH reserves the right to further extend the acceptance period and, to the extent necessary and permissible, will do so in order for the acceptance period to cover applicable decision-making procedures at relevant authorities. PMHH also reserves the right to postpone the settlement date, however, that settlement shall in any event be made within 7 business days following the expiration of the acceptance period (provided that the Offer has been declared unconditional). PMHH will announce any extension of the acceptance period and/or postponement of the settlement date by a press release in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.The shares tendered in the Offer as of October 3, 2022 amount to in aggregate 7,808,041 shares in Swedish Match, corresponding to approximately 0.51 percent3 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match.For administrative questions regarding the Offer, please contact your bank or the nominee registered as holder of your shares.The information was submitted for publication on October 4, 2022 at 10.10 p.m. (CEST).Information about the Offerwww.smokefree-offer.comImportant informationThis press release has been published in Swedish and English.

As a result, customers across China can receive international money transfers digitally into their bank accounts from their loved ones. The process of receiving the money transfers in discussion is enabled by a mini app integrated into Weixin called “Weihuikuan”.Each of the transfers that the Chinese customers will receive through Weixin can amount to a maximum $3000. Weixin users merely need to furnish their Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) and other required information in the ""Weihuikuan"" mini program for depositing funds into their bank accounts through digital means.The latest tie-up highlights Western Union’s sincere efforts to offer customers wider choices, speed, security and convenience in receiving money transfers. Its constant efforts to engage in partnerships for enhancing and digitizing the money movement process are also clearly reflected in the recent move.The newly-introduced service on Weixin hints at Western Union's intense focus on strengthening its presence across China. WU shows prudence in keeping a keen eye on China, which occupied one of the top five spots among the recipient of remittances across the globe last year, according to the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).China has been witnessing widespread digital penetration and a rising number of Internet users so far, providing Western Union with the perfect ground to capitalize on partnerships or technology investments.Western Union remains the preferred partner for conducting money transfers, considering its expansive worldwide reach into billions of bank accounts, including millions of wallets and cards spanning more than 130 countries. WU also has agent locations stretched across more than 200 countries and territories.Story continuesSimilar to Western Union, other companies like Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and MoneyGram International, Inc. MGI resorted to creating a solid digital arm for capitalizing on robust demand for hassle-free money transfer services.Mastercard is firmly focused on collaborating with global and regional financial service providers to upgrade the money movement process for consumers and businesses. MA continues adhering to a digital partnership strategy and undertaking significant investments to enhance its digital capabilities.Visa facilitates seamless and secure transfer of funds on a real-time basis worldwide. To complement its endeavor, V pursues collaborations to aid the cross-border payments industry with innovative digital solutions to replace age-old processes. Visa B2B Connect delivers innovative B2B cross-border payments and keeps adding partners to its network.MoneyGram has been expanding its digital money transfer business rapidly via constant partnerships and significant investments. MGI’s investments in expanding digital network, now extending to more than 100 countries, are paying off as more and more digital partners are using its global platform. In September 2022, MGI extended its strategic partnership with e&amp; (earlier known as Etisalat Group) brand’s e&amp; international that is expected to enable e&amp; money mobile-wallet users to send money globally in real time.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Realty Income Corp. O, Simon Property Group SPG, Kimco Realty Corp. KIM and Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Will Retail REITs Continue to Rebound This Holiday Season?The rising prices of commodities and the consequent impact on consumers' spending might have fueled fears among retailers and their landlords — retail REITs — for the upcoming holiday season. However, the favorable job-and-wage growth environment, which supports consumer confidence, and stimulus savings from last year are raising hopes. Predictions also suggest that retail sales will pick up during the holiday season.Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to surge 7.1% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period that runs from Nov 1-Dec 24. While in-store retail sales are projected to increase 7.9%, e-commerce is expected to rise 4.2%.Obviously, this is a positive for retail REITs like Realty Income Corp., Simon Property Group, Kimco Realty Corp.  and Federal Realty Investment Trust .The retail real estate industry is poised to benefit from the pent-up consumer demand as consumers look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience, following the pandemic downtime. Amid these, retailers' focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gain in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish.Retailers are also focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Story continuesFurthermore, amid limited availability and with the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost. This will support the growth of retail REITs like Realty Income, Simon Property, Kimco Realty, Federal Realty and others.Moreover, omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations.Digitally native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy as the opening of stores helps them improve their connection with customers and drive expansion.In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on boosting their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REITs' growth scopes.Nevertheless, inflationary pressure, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings might temper consumers' willingness to spend to some extent. With office usage affected and international tourism yet to regain lost ground, certain submarkets also remain choppy.Moreover, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers. This is likely to affect the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and hurt demand for retail REITs' properties.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

88,b34dc239-8918-346c-9d49-a2f3c9535fc2,GS,2022-10-05,A Timeline of Elon Musk’s Takeover of Twitter: The Deal Is On,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timeline-elon-musk-became-twitter-205930962.html,1664916828,STORY,['TSLA'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is now the owner of Twitter Inc., capping months of speculation over whether he would complete the deal. It’s been a wild ride for all involved, but after several fits and starts, the company is finally in the hands of the tech billionaire who also runs Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Here’s the timeline of how it came together.Most Read from BloombergTwitter Now Asks Some Fired Workers to Please Come BackPutin’s Ukraine War Is Entering a Terrifying New PhaseUkraine Latest: US and Russia Discussed Containing War, WSJ SaysLawyer Suing Twitter Over Layoffs Says Musk Trying to ComplyHouston Mogul’s $75 Million Win on Astros Hits Caesars HardestJan. 31: Musk starts building his stakeThe year begins with Musk quietly acquiring Twitter shares. By March 14, he accumulates over a 5% stake, the point at which he’s supposed to disclose the activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission — a misstep that later would trigger a shareholder lawsuit.March 24: Musk starts criticizing Twitter, on TwitterIn late March, with his stake still secret, Musk begins lobbing criticism at the company: “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he tweets on March 24. “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?” he asks on March 25. “Is a new platform needed?” Musk says on March 26. “Am giving serious thought to this.”April 4: Musk’s stake becomes public, and he’s invited to join Twitter’s boardIt becomes known that Musk is Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with more than 9% of the company. His filing lists him as a passive investor, but he’s been actively tweeting about changes to the business. That includes polling users on whether they want an edit button, which would allow people to change tweets after they’ve been published. By end of day, Twitter invites Musk to join the board contingent on him not owning more than 14.9% of the company’s stock.Story continuesApril 5: Musk becomes an active investorIn the morning, several of Twitter’s board members take to the platform to congratulate Musk on his decision to join their ranks. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal tweets that the company and Musk have been chatting for weeks. Later that day, Musk refiles his disclosure to classify himself as an active investor, after indicating that he would accept a seat on the social network’s board.April 9: Musk rejects the board seatMusk rejects the offer to join the board, and Twitter holds the news for roughly 36 hours while waiting to see if he will change his mind. He spends the weekend tweeting more suggestions for the business, like converting Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter “since no one shows up anyway” and charging for user verification, a service that has been free and reserved for notable figures.April 10: Twitter announces Musk is not joining the boardOn Sunday, Agrawal sends a note to employees about Musk not joining the board and later tweets it publicly. Neither Agrawal or Musk give a reason for the reversal.April 11: Speculation aboundsMusk files an amended disclosure with the SEC. He can now purchase as many shares as he wants. Without a board seat, he doesn’t have to act in the best interest of Twitter shareholders. Within the company, which doesn’t have a founder with majority control like other tech giants, employees are “super stressed” and concerned that this is only the beginning of the turmoil.April 14: Musk offers to buy the whole companyIn an SEC filing and accompanying tweet, Musk says he would buy out stockholders in a cash deal then valued at $43 billion to take Twitter private. The offer is $54.20 a share, a 54% premium over the price when he started building his stake in January. Morgan Stanley is brought in to advise on the bid, which Musk describes as his “best and final” offer.April 15: Twitter adopts ‘poison pill’ to ward off Musk takeoverTo thwart Musk, Twitter launches a so-called poison pill, which is a rights plan that allows shareholders to purchase shares at a discount if any shareholder exceeds 15% ownership. It’s a tactic that would effectively dilute the billionaire’s stake. The company says that the intention of the plan is to ensure that anyone taking control through open-market accumulation will pay all shareholders an appropriate premium. Twitter begins to field interest from other parties, and is advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, among others. Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, a friend of Musk, acknowledges in a tweet that as a public company Twitter has always been for sale.April 16: ‘Twitter’s board owns almost no shares’In a flurry of tweets about the potential deal, Musk says, “With Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares,” so its economic interests are not aligned with shareholders. Dorsey replies, “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company.” Dorsey is scheduled to leave the board once his term expires at the next shareholder meeting on May 25.April 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in fundingMusk says he’s secured $46.5 billion in funding. A filing with the SEC shows that he has $25.5 billion in debt financing from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, including margin loans backed by his equity stake in Tesla and $21 billion in equity financing from himself. But whether the billionaire will sell part of his stake in one of his prized companies to acquire Twitter remains to be seen.April 25: Twitter agrees to be boughtTwitter yields to Musk’s original offer of $54.20 a share. The transaction, valued at about $44 billion, will take the company private. Musk says he will prioritize free speech on the site, make its algorithms open-source, eliminate spam and add new features. Twitter says it expects the deal to close this year.April 29: Musk sells Tesla stockMusk discloses an additional $4.5 billion worth of Tesla stock sales in new regulatory filings, followed by disclosures of 4.4 million shares sold the two prior days, bringing the total to around $8.5 billion that he’s disposed of in the process of buying Twitter. Musk has now sold about $25 billion worth of stock in the electric-car maker during the last six months.May 4: Billionaire backers pony up additional fundsMusk raises an additional $7.1 billion to fund the transaction. Backers include Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, who puts up $1 billion. The bid also gets $800 million from Sequoia Capital, $700 million from Vy Capital and $500 million from Binance, with more than a dozen others contributing as well, according to company filings. Musk secures a pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who agrees to roll over his nearly 35 million Twitter shares, worth about $1.9 billion at $54.20 per share.May 6: Plans for Twitter revealedIn a pitch deck presented to investors and seen by the New York Times, Musk lays out aggressive growth plans for Twitter, including aiming to quintuple revenue $26.4 billion by 2028, from $5 billion last year, and increasing users to 931 million from 217 million. To accomplish this, he plans to expand the company’s negligible payments business currently used for tipping creators, and increase it to $15 million in revenue by 2023 and $1.3 billion by 2028. The deck also reveals plans to cut the company’s reliance on advertising to less than 50% of revenue, further develop a subscription product and prepare for fluctuating headcount.May 10: Trump ban to be liftedMusk confirms that he would reverse Twitter’s ban on former US president Donald Trump once he’s the owner.“I would reverse the permanent ban,” he says at a Financial Times conference. “Perma bans just fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter as a town square where everyone can voice their opinion.”“My opinion, and Jack Dorsey I want to be clear shares this opinion, is that we should not have permanent bans,” Musk says. Dorsey tweets his agreement, and both men add caveats that illegal behavior or spam wouldn’t be allowed.May 12: Hiring freeze goes into effect and key executives departCEO Agrawal announces a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts amid the state of uncertainty over the acquisition. Two of Twitter’s top leaders also depart: Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue product. Beykpour tweets, “Interrupting my paternity leave to share some final @twitter-related news: I’m leaving the company after over 7 years.” He adds: “The truth is this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision. Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.”According to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, the company is halting hiring and may rescind outstanding offers. The company is also pulling back on costs such as travel, consulting and marketing. Agrawal says global events, including the war in Ukraine and supply-chain crunch, have hurt Twitter’s business, but broad job cuts aren’t yet planned.May 13: Musk hits the brakesWith bots surfacing as a deal breaker, Musk tweets, “Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.” This sends Twitter’s stock plummeting. A few hours later he tweets that he is “still committed” to the acquisition and is waiting on confirmation that fake accounts on the social-media platform contributes to less than 5% of its users.May 16: Musk and Agrawal have it out...on TwitterIn a tweetstorm, Agrawal explains that measuring spam accounts is complicated because some are actually real humans even if they look like spam, and vice versa. Twitter also allows bots on the service, so simply setting up an automated account is not against the rules. Musk is not impressed with Agrawal’s response and suggests calling users to verify their accounts. He then replies to Agrawal with a poop emoji.May 17: Musk threatens to pull outMusk declares that he won’t proceed with his takeover plan unless the social-media giant can prove bots make up fewer than 5% of its users. The comment stokes speculation that Musk may be trying to lower the price. But Twitter’s board says it plans to enforce the $44 billion agreement, and that directors have already voted to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve Musk’s $54.20-a-share offer.If the deal falls apart due to financing issues, Musk would have to pay a $1 billion breakup fee, but he can’t walk away for just any reason. The merger agreement includes a specific performance provision that allows Twitter to force Musk to consummate the takeover, according to a securities filing. That could mean that, should the deal end up in court, Twitter might secure an order obligating Musk to complete the merger rather than winning monetary compensation for any violations of it.July 8: Musk backs out of deal, citing ‘spam bots’Musk backs out of the deal to buy the platform, saying in a regulatory filing that the company has made “misleading representations” over the number of so-called spam bots on the service. He also says in a letter to Twitter that the company hasn’t “complied with its contractual obligations” to provide information about how to assess how prevalent the bots are on the social-media service and argues that Twitter has failed to operate its normal course of business.July 12: Twitter sues MuskTwitter files suit in Delaware Chancery Court to compel Musk to complete the deal. In the lawsuit, Twitter says, “Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” Musk then countersues Twitter, arguing the company misled investors and the SEC and was “frantically closing the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud,” according to the filing reviewed by Bloomberg.Sept. 29: Private texts revealedAs part of the lawsuit slated to go to trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court, Musk’s private text messages become public, revealing how the deal came together, including early conversations with Dorsey.There are also a flurry of messages from industry insiders who offer suggestions on who should be CEO. Investor Bill Lee suggests Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital. Steve Jurvetson pushes for the former chief business officer of Uber Technologies Inc., Emil Michael. And investor Jason Calacanis texts, “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.”Oct. 4: Musk revives $44 billion takeover bidTo avoid a courtroom fight, Elon Musk revives his bid for Twitter at the original offer price of $54.20 a share. Twitter shares climb as much as 23% after resuming trading following a halt on the news.Oct. 6: It’s do or dieDelaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick agrees to pause the court case to give the two parties a chance to complete the deal. A hard deadline is set for agreement to be reached by Oct. 28 at 5 p.m., or a trial will resume in November.Oct. 27: Musk buys TwitterWith the court deadline approaching, Musk finalizes the deal and takes possession of Twitter.His first act is to fire the executive leadership that thwarted him, including CEO Agrawal.As he tweets plans for unbanning accounts and charging for user verification, there are murmurings of another wave of Twitter quitters. General Motors Co. pauses ads. Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes tweets, “Not hanging around for whatever Elon has planned. Bye.”The deal is done, ending Twitter’s nine-year run as a public company. But with Musk poised to cut jobs and shake up the company’s business model, the upheaval may just be beginning.(Updates with closing of deal.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEl Salvador’s $300 Million Bitcoin ‘Revolution’ Is Failing MiserablyUS Housing Hit by Spiraling Mortgage Rates as Inflation PersistsYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid Mystery©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The investor was hoping for more clarity on a restructuring of the capital intensive eOne entertainment business it acquired for $4 billion in 2019, among other wish list items.Instead, Hasbro outlined what some investors deemed too aggressive growth targets for 2027. Moreover, the company promised to increase operating profits by a whopping 50% over the next three years — mostly through cost cuts and new product introductions. All of that hype by management comes despite rising economic pressures causing a contraction in U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2022.The mounting financial pressure on consumers and volatile currency markets caused Hasbro to slash its full year sales guidance at the event and bank on a big holiday quarter to meet its lowered financial goals.Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks at the company's investor day on Tuesday. (screenshot)The lack of enthusiasm after investor day showed in Hasbro's stock price performance by the closing bell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 825 points in Tuesday's session, yet Hasbro’s stock barely finished up 2%. Rival Mattel's stock advanced 3% on the day.Hasbro — which somehow thwarted a well-thought out activist attack by investor Alta Fox several months ago — continues to see its stock hover around a 52-week low after several challenging quarters.The stock is off by 30% so far in 2022, lagging even the S&amp;P 500's 20% drop.

More specifically, Hasbro expects 3Q revenue to decline 15% (down 12% in constant currency) vs. Street down 5% heading into today with a more significant impact on operating profit given the mix of revenue compared to last year. Full-year revenue growth is now guided flat to down slightly in constant currency (vs. up low-single digit prior) while Hasbro maintained its operating margin guide of 16.0%.

""The unprecedented growth in demand for this critical mineral requires high-quality production without compromising sustainability. The integration of Gradiant technology into our direct lithium extraction (DLE) flowsheet has been key in our strategy to improve sustainability in the global lithium production industry.""Gradiant’s new solution enhances the impact of the sustainable lithium extraction process—reduced time-to-market and environmental footprint. The technology enables high levels of lithium concentration in a fraction of the time required by conventional methods, while also reducing carbon emissions, energy consumption, and capital costs when compared to thermal-based technologies. This technology integration can be applied into new lithium mineral extraction and production sites, opening opportunities to untapped lithium production regions, as well as existing lithium production operations.The collaboration will enable the lithium industry to meet surging mineral demand with a previously unattainable level of water utilization, by simultaneously lowering the consumption of fresh water and reducing wastewater.Story continues""We are excited to be working with Schlumberger, with whom we are pioneering a new era of sustainable mineral resource recovery,"" said Prakash Govindan, COO of Gradiant. ""This is made possible by Gradiant’s deep understanding of the complex chemistry that underlies the production processes, which is then operationalized by machine learning and digital technology.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Repsol REPYY, BP plc BP, Equinor EQNR, Shell SHEL, and Schlumberger SLB.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Energy Firms Pledging to Cut Carbon Emissions to Zero by 2050With the rise of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investing and a broad-based transition toward clean energy, a number of oil/gas companies have decided voluntarily to become carbon neutral over the next three decades.The Net-Zero ScenarioCarbon neutrality, also termed as net zero, refers to a situation wherein all carbon (and other greenhouse gas, or GHG) emissions are offset by absorbing the same from the atmosphere. It is considered an important yardstick by climate scientists to ensure that global warming is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, in sync with the Paris Climate Agreement.Of late, the concept has gained traction operationally, with companies across a diverse spectrum laying out concrete strategies about their future sustainability endeavors. For the energy operators in particular, the pressure to decarbonize has been intensified by institutional investors and major clients committing to an ESG agenda and consequently snubbing carbon emitters.As the focus on energy transition accelerates, let's look at some of the oil and gas companies outlining net-zero commitments by 2050.It all started with Repsol, which in December 2019, announced its non-binding plan of reducing net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The move, which complies with the Paris Agreement climate goals, marked the first such initiative in the oil and gas industry.The company is expected to use its 2016 carbon intensity level as the baseline. It plans to reduce 10% intensity by 2025 and 20% in the next five years. It expects carbon intensity to fall 40% by 2040 and reach 100% by 2050.Story continuesIn February 2020, BP plc announced a plan to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 or sooner. This London-based energy behemoth plans to sell assets worth some $25 billion to finance its green energy push. As part of its net-zero ambition, this company has vowed to cut fossil fuel production by 40% from the 2019 levels.That year, Norway's Equinor also set out its strategy to enhance its transformation into a net-zero carbon emitter. The company plans to reduce net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030 and 40% by 2035 while investing more in renewables and low-carbon solutions.In 2021, Suncor Energy committed to slash overall emissions across its operations by 10 million tons per year by 2030. Notably, this would imply a nearly 30% reduction in GHG emissions, which amounted to 29 million tons in 2019. The second-largest oil producer in Canada said in May that it intends to be net zero by 2050.Suncor is also one of the founding signatories of a coalition of leading Canadian oil sands producers that recently announced a collaboration to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from their operations by 2050.Shell also gave a climate strategy update last year, establishing its short- and medium-term goals for reducing its carbon footprint. The London-based company, which assumes to have peaked its total carbon emissions in 2018, is aiming to slash its net carbon intensity by 6-8% in 2023 from the 2016 baseline and further 20% by 2030. Additionally, the decrease will expand to 45% in 2035 before achieving its goal of zero emission by 2050.In June 2021, EQT Corporation brought forward a comprehensive plan to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across its operations by 2025. This leading natural gas producer pledged to slash GHG emission intensity by 70% in just four years. Moreover, it set a climate target to reduce 65% of the company's methane emission intensity below the 2018 levels by 2025.Schlumberger is another energy major that is targeting net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The leading oilfield service player is planning a 30% cut in direct and indirect emissions by as early as 2025. Importantly, the company expects to reach the short-term target ahead of schedule.By 2030, the company is eyeing to cut emissions by 50%. By this timeframe, the company is also planning to reduce Scope 3 (or indirect) emissions by 30%. Schlumberger boasted of becoming the first company in the energy service industry to add Scope 3 emissions ambition in the net-zero emission target.Other oil and gas firms that committed to a net-zero emissions strategy include TotalEnergies, Devon Energy and Occidental Energy etc.Wrapping UpAs one can see, a significant number of major oil companies have publicly set net-zero environmental pledges by 2050, mostly since 2020. A big reason for such a rallying call is the market's growing recognition of corporate ESG credentials.There is no doubt that the Oil/Energy space has stepped up efforts toward a decarbonization goal. At the same time, the pathway to balance harmful emissions is not without its share of challenges. First and foremost, the companies need to earmark large amounts of capital on ESG initiatives (research and development, utilization of new technology etc.) that might hurt future returns and lower equity value. There are also significant technology and execution risks.  As of now, it is difficult to ascertain how much of this is hype and how much actual change will occur as this complex evolution involves a monumental shift in the energy sector's business model by effectively moving away from their primary operations of oil and gas development.     While some of the transition strategies are very ambitious indeed, what's clear is that companies with a strong ESG bent are held in high regard by the public that might ultimately boost the stock price.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Air Products and Chemicals shares have held up better than the peer group as well as the broader market, with the stock down -2.9% over the past year vs. -8.7% decline for the Zacks sub-industry and -15% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The Zacks analysts discusses the challenges facing the company like the impact of higher power and fuel costs on margins and currency headwinds, but sees Air Products' strong cash flows and history of shareholder returns offsetting these issues. Strategic investments in high-return projects, new business deals and acquisitions are expected to drive the company’s results in fiscal 2022. Also, Air Products is committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong cash flows. It will also benefit from productivity actions. The acquisition of PBF Energy plants is also contributing to its results.(You can read the full research report on Air Products and Chemicals here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Southern Copper shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous  industry over the past year (-15.1% vs. -13.3%). The company anticipates copper production in 2022 to be lower year over year reflecting the suspension of operations at Cuajone as well as temporary reduction in ore grades.Production is expected to recover in 2023 and reach 971,000 tons with the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. Its strict cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.Even though copper prices have declined lately, it will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States and the global initiatives to address climate change. This will support Southern Copper's top-line performance. Backed by industry-leading copper reserves as well as growth investments, the company is well poised to continue delivering solid results.(You can read the full research report on Southern Copper here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Discover Financial shares have declined -26.4% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry’s decline of -38.0% on the back of rising macroeconomic worries. Exacerbating the macro headwinds are the company’s weak margins outlook and expectations of rising provisions for loan losses.However, Discover Financial’s integrated digital banking and payments model, as well as the ongoing economic recovery is buoying its performance. Expanding global payments operations and an attractive core business poise the company well for growth.Several digital transformation efforts bode well for DFS. Its strong balance sheet is a major positive, highlighted by a healthy liquidity portfolio.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share, indicating a change of -61.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 points to a change of -30.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.49 indicates a change of -40% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $866.83 million indicates a year-over-year change of -34.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.78 billion and $3.79 billion estimates indicate -15.2% and -20.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.2%. EPS of $0.95 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $896.2 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.88%. The EPS surprise was +37.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-62-past-netflix-inc-120048584.html,1664971248,STORY,['NFLX'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 62% losses, last week’s 7.3% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Netflix. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Netflix?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Netflix. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Netflix's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Netflix. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.3% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Wilmot Hastings, the CEO has 1.2% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NetflixThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Netflix, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$1.4b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in Netflix. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Netflix  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

101,d7f94780-b123-3aa4-87e0-a5a1ecaf9a24,NFLX,2022-10-05,Walt Disney: Look to the Long Term,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-look-long-term-171543429.html,1664903743,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","[The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is trading back below $100, around the same level the stock was trading at when the Coronavirus pandemic caused the stock market to crash in March 2020.This decline seems overdone in my opinion. In 2020, the global economy faced the risk of a prolonged depression and a slump in spending, a spike in unemployment and massive supply chain disruption.Today the picture is uncertain, but I still think it is far better for Disney than it was in March 2020. For a start, Disney has made a huge success of its streaming service. Its amusement parks are also back up and running again, and it remains one of the most iconic brands in entertainment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISThe companys outlook is improving Though Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is still dominating the streaming market in terms of overall subscriber base with nearly 220.7 million subscribers, Disney+ is catching up rapidly. It has acquired 152.2 million subscribers since launching in 2019 and it does not look as if this growth is going to slow any time soon.As Netflix is struggling to maintain its growth, consumers are still flocking to Disneys offering. Disneys streaming service, Disney+, gained 14.4 million subscribers in the second quarter, compared to Netflixs loss of just under 1 million subscribers.Still, the company is continuing to recover from the pandemic. With revenues from its theme parks still recovering, Wall Street analysts have pencilled in earnings per share of $3.85 for 2022 rising to $5.43 in 2023. That is still far below the $7.23 per share reported for 2018 and $6.24 for 2019.Notably, Disney has not restored its dividend, which it cut in 2020 to conserve cash. Analysts do not expect the payout to return until 2023 based on earnings growth projections.Look to the long term This begs the question, does Disney deserve to be undervalued, or is the stocks slump just a reflection of the markets wider malaise? It seems it is the latter in my view. Shares of Disney have traded around 15 to 20 times forward earnings predictions for much of the past five years. Today, based on Wall Street estimates, the stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.9. That suggests shares are neither cheap nor expensive.Story continuesHowever, in the past two years, the stock has looked expensive, trading at a price-earnings ratio as high as 100 at some points. This was due to a combination of the market bubble, Disney's drop in earnings due to the theme park closings and investments in the currently unprofitable Disney+.Based on these numbers, it appears as if the markets view of Disney has reverted to the mean after two explosive years. This could present an opportunity for value investors who can look past current market conditions to the long term.Disney has not lost its competitive advantages. In fact, one could argue that thanks to the growth of Disney+, its advantages are only more entrenched. Consumers know and love the brand, and they are willing to pay a premium to get access to its services and watch its programs. In a harsh economic climate, these advantages are vital.The real question we need to be asking is not if Disney is expensive, but if the companys competitive advantages are under threat. Based on the information we have today, I would argue they are not.This makes it easier to assess if the business is a good value. Assuming the company's moat remains in place, I see no reason why it cannot grow earnings at least in line with inflation in the long run.In the 10 years to 2019, Disney had achieved compound annual earnings growth of 12%. If it can return to this trend, I estimate the company could be significantly undervalued at current levels, a theses which is supported by the GF Value chart:Walt Disney: Look to the Long TermThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

OneView, Roku's ad platform built for TV streaming, is directly integrated with Nielsen's measurement solution, enabling robust, person-level measurement of ad campaigns on the Roku platform.As marketers are shifting to TV streaming, this collaboration will make measurements simpler and more accurate and also build upon a longstanding relationship between Roku and Nielsen.Roku’s Library Aids its GrowthRoku is benefiting from strong momentum in average revenue per user (ARPU) and improving user engagement. ARPU was $44.10 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting an increase of 21% year over year, while active accounts were 63.1 million, reflecting an increase of 14% year over year.This is primarily because Roku has been focusing on expanding its portfolio on The Roku Channel and also Roku Originals.It recently added 14 new linear channels, of which the local news channels seemed to gain the most traction. These newly launched channels that offer a wide range of genres like Westerns, Spanish-language entertainment and true crime are expected to drive viewers’ interest and increase active accounts.Roku also continues its momentum on Roku Originals.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 25% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 10.0%.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Amgen investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. View our latest analysis for Amgen To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Amgen managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.1% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 5% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Amgen will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Amgen's TSR for the last 5 years was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 8%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Sales have been slowing and that is worrying retailers. However, even then, they are banking heavily on the upcoming holiday season, which like every year, is expected to boost retail sales.Retailers are thus leaving no stone unturned to make the most of the holiday season. Although the sector is faced with several challenges, including soaring commodity prices, retailers are trying their best to ramp up sales during this period. Several retailers this year plan to launch early holiday deals, while others are on a hiring spree to meet the surge in demand during that period.Aggressive HiringThe retail sector has been struggling with sales slowing month over month for quite some time. However, a modest but 0.4% jump in retail sales in August ahead of the holiday season is a good sign for the worried retailers.

Supply-chain crisis and higher freight charges are also hindering smooth sales. However, retailers are hopeful for a great holiday season.Holiday season sales account for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers and are one of the most important sales windows. And this holiday season might not be as bad for the retail sector as was initially anticipated. The annual holiday retail estimate from Deloitte predicts a 4-6% increase in retail sales.Spending will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion between November and January. Sales during the holiday season last year totaled $1.49 trillion, a 15.1% increase from 2020. Given that everyone is wary about spending this year, the prediction is quite low, but the good thing is that even then, sales are expected to rise quite significantly.Story continuesThis has made retailers optimistic, and they are once again going on a hiring spree. Retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Target Corporation TGT will be launching early holiday deals, which will begin in October.Target Corporation plans to hire 10,000 seasonal workers ahead of the holiday season to meet customers’ demands during that period. TGT is also back with its ‘Target Deals Day’ with the aim of luring more customers to buy essentials and must-have products. This time, Target Corporation will start the ‘Target Deals Day’ on Oct 6, which will continue till Oct 8.Moreover, for those who look for the best deals, TGT is coming up with “Holiday Price Match Guarantee.” The offer will start on Oct 6 and continue through Dec 24. Target Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS too is aggressively hiring workers for the upcoming holiday season. DKS plans to hire at least 9,000 heads ahead of the holiday season. DICK’s Sporting Goods has been doing well despite the sector facing several challenges because of its both strong online and offline presence. Given that a lot of people plan to travel this year, DKS expects sales of its athletic wear to grow during the holiday season.Walmart Inc. WMT has always been a major player during the holiday season. This time it’s going to be no different. WMT will be hiring 40,000 workers ahead of the holiday season. Walmart intends to fill in a wide range of positions, from temporary store clerks to full-time, permanent truck drivers. For the holiday season, Walmart more hours will be available to its existing employees.Walmart also unveiled updated return policies and windows, including a return pickup from home option for Walmart+ members for the holiday season.Macy's, Inc. M is also keeping pace with other major retailers and is planning to hire thousands of workers for the holiday season. Last week, M said that it was looking to hire more than 41,000 seasonal full- and part-time employees for its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury stores, as well as call centers and supply-chain locations.Macy said that it will start its pay at $15 per hour, with flexible scheduling options that may include voluntary overtime. Employees will receive discounts, and some programs may allow them to make extra money. M also said that most job offers are made within 48 hours and provide information on online and in-person hiring events, bloomingdalesJOBS.com, and bluemercury.com.

They are expected to agree to a reduction of at least 1 million barrels a day to push up crude prices, though some analysts believe the cuts could reach 2 million.Reduced supply would likely drive up US gas prices ahead of November's midterm elections, as they could lead to a rally in oil prices from their recent losses. The November 8 elections are just five weeks away.The White House described the expected OPEC+ output cuts as a ""total disaster"" that could be seen as a ""hostile act"" in draft talking points to the US Treasury cited by CNN.President Joe Biden has emphasized a recent slide in gas prices as part of his re-election campaign, with the White House championing his efforts to lower ""everyday costs for American families"".""Higher oil prices, if driven by sizeable production cuts, would likely irritate the Biden administration ahead of U.S. midterm elections,"" Citi strategists said in a note, per Reuters.""There could be further political reactions from the U.S., including additional releases of strategic stocks,"" they added. The Biden administration could also push forward with an anti-trust bill targeting OPEC, they said.The White House didn't immediately respond to an Insider request for comment.""We've been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for consumers around the world and we will continue to talk with our partners about that,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told CNN.Story continuesThis wouldn't be the first time that the Biden administration has clashed with OPEC+ over supply cuts. The oil cartel refused to release additional stocks to the market after Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove crude prices above $125 a barrel in March.The US has already been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude oil exporter, to keep its output high and drag down Russia's oil revenues. In July, Biden met Saudi de-facto leader Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman, but failed to agree a deal for the country to ramp up supply.OPEC's power faded in the past decade thanks to the US shale boom, but its power is now at an all-time high, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Jeff Currie.The reason OPEC is considering a cut to production even as the oil market remains tight with low inventories is that crude prices have fallen because investors are fleeing the market, Currie told CNBC.Oil prices have fallen in the past three months to trade around $90 a barrel, from about $120. But they have risen sharply in recent sessions on expectations for the OPEC+ cuts. Brent crude futures on Wednesday slipped 0.46% to $91.40 a barrel. WTI crude was down 0.53% to $81.02 a barrel.Crude prices could hit $100 a barrel if OPEC+ cuts production as expected, Kpler energy analyst Viktor Katona told Insider Monday.Read more: OPEC is mulling an oil-production cut of more than 1 million barrels per day, and the move is exactly the opposite of what the US wants right nowRead the original article on Business Insider]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, National Fuel Gas Co. NFG, General Mills Inc. GIS, Constellation Brands Inc. STZ and Molina Healthcare Inc. MOH.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Defensive Sectors Likely to Shine the Rest of 2022September was historically known as the toughest month on Wall Street. This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets were more disappointing, courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to the astonishing savings of Americans in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock valuation.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large  The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 would be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Investors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.Story continuesAs the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar, — the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low, the euro is at a 20-year low and the Chinese yuan has fallen to its 14-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Economists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. Last month, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.88%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Why Should You Choose Defensive Stocks?Markets are likely to remain volatile as market participants are currently assessing the possibility of a near-term recession and factorizing its financial cost into equities valuations. At this juncture, defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care should provide stability to one's portfolio.Defensive sectors are mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. These sectors include companies that provide necessities and products for daily use. Therefore, these sectors have always been a go-to place for investors, who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations irrespective of internal or external disturbances.All the 11 broad- sectors of the market's benchmark the S&amp;P 500 Index declined year to date. However, defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and health care have tumbled less than the slide of aggressive sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and communication services. Cyclical sectors namely, financials, materials and industrials also dropped more than double of the defensive sectors.How to Select StocksInvestors should select stocks from defensive sectors that have strong potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks must have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. This indicates that the market is expecting these companies to do solid business in the rest of this year.

""The decline was often attributed to the impact of sanctions on business operations.""New export orders fell further from August levels and while new business increased, it did so at the slowest pace in the current four-month sequence of expansion.Employment also fell, at its fastest pace since May.It was not clear how heavily President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilisation order, made on Sept. 21, had weighed on workforce numbers. Tens of thousands of men have been drafted into the army or have fled abroad since then.Concerns regarding economic and political uncertainty weighed on sentiment, S&amp;P said, though business confidence ticked higher on hopes of increased client demand.A sister survey earlier this week showed that Russian factory activity grew at its fastest rate in 3-1/2 years in September, though Western sanctions continued to weigh on export business.The manufacturing sector registered six months of contraction that began in February, when Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering unprecedented Western sanctions on Moscow.(Reporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

If you want to skip the fund’s history, recent performance and details about its overall portfolio, please go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn.Billionaire Sir Chris Hohn is the founder of The Children’s Investment, or TCI Fund Management, a London-based hedge fund. Mr. Hohn was born in 1966 in Addlestone, Surrey, in a working-class family. His father was a car mechanic, and his mother was a legal secretary. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in accounting and business economics from the University of Southampton. On being advised by one of his tutors at the University of Southampton, Mr. Hohn applied to the Harvard Business School (HBS) for an MBA. At HBS, he graduated among the top 5% of his batch, becoming one of the Baker Scholars, the institution’s highest award for academic achievement. He worked at multiple noted PE and hedge funds in New York and London for a few years before setting up TCI Fund Management in 2003.TCI takes a long-term, value-oriented approach while investing and strongly focuses on environmental, social and governance issues. It is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, with over $50 billion in assets under management.Mr. Hohn is also a well-known philanthropist, having donated billions of dollars to charitable causes over the years. He is a founder and major supporter of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a UK-based charity that works to improve the lives of children in developing countries. He has also given large sums of money to educational causes and environmental causes.Mr. Hohn is well known on Wall Street and in the financial center of London for his aggressive negotiating style. He has been involved in a number of high-profile battles with companies, including a successful campaign to force the reform of the London Stock Exchange. He is also a passionate supporter of greater disclosure of information by companies and has been critical of the way in which some banks have operated in the past.Story continuesFor his philanthropic contributions, Mr. Hohn was knighted in 2014. The Children’s Investment Fund Management has generated strong returns since it was founded. In 2021, the fund generated a return of 23.3% for its investors, making it the sixth of the past seven years when TCI reported double-digit gains.TCI Fund Management’s Portfolio The value of TCI Fund Management’s 13F portfolio declined to $31.6 billion at the end of Q2 from $36.84 billion at the end of March. Because the fund has always run a concentrated portfolio, there was not much churning seen in TCI Fund Management’s portfolio during Q2.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) continued to be among TCI Fund Management’s top 10 stock picks at the end of Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris HohnChris HohnOur MethodologyAt Insider Monkey, we cover the portfolios of 895 hedge funds, closely tracking the stocks they buy and sell. We selected the ten stocks discussed in this article based on the 13F regulatory filing submitted by TCI Fund Management with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30. These are the top ten picks of Hohn's fund, according to its second quarter portfolio.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $172,633,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was the only stock among its top stock picks in which  TCI Fund Management initiated a new stake during Q2. Founded in 1967, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is among the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the world. Due to macro uncertainty and supply chain issues the semiconductor industry has been facing in the last few quarters, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) recently got featured in Insider Monkey’s list of 5 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Uncertainty Grows.One of the major reasons TCI Fund Management decided to buy the stock during the second quarter could be the drastic decline it has suffered this year. Having lost close to 48% of its value year-to-date, Applied Materials, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock currently trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of only 10.95.On September 28, analysts at Barclays reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while reducing their price target to $85 from $95, which represents almost no potential upside from where the stock is currently trading.9. Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $940,029,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.97%    Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Although TCI Fund Management reduced its stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) by 10% during the second quarter, the stock’s popularity among smart money investors saw a massive jump during that time. From just 21 hedge funds among those covered by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) at the end of March, the number jumped to 32 at the end of June. Funds that initiated a stake in the company during the second quarter included billionaire Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Ken Heebner’s Capital Growth Management, and Jinghua Yan’s TwinBeech Capital.Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP), as the name suggests, is based in Boston, Massachusetts and is currently the country’s largest publicly-held developer and owner of Class A office properties. It focuses on five major property markets in the country: Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC. On September 20, Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) announced that it had acquired a six-story life sciences property with a total area of 271,000 square feet adjacent to Kendall Center from Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). The gross purchase price of this deal was around $592 million, and Biogen has leased the property back from Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) and will continue to occupy the premise until April 2028.8. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $1,120,178,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Railroad major Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) stock seems to be following the trajectory of a roller coaster this year. Having started the year near the $200 level, it reached its lifetime high of $278.94 in May, but has pared all that gain as it currently trades flat year-to-date. Why following smart money can reap rich rewards for ordinary investors can be gauged from how smart money has played this stock. Between mid-2017 and the first quarter of this year, when the stock rose from $100 levels to $250 levels, hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) climbed from 49 to 90. However, that number fell all the way down to 65 in just one quarter.On September 15, executives at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and other railroad majors breathed a sigh of relief. After many months of negotiations, US railway workers and companies finally reached an agreement averting a potential strike that could have caused another logistical nightmare like what we saw post-COVID. Out of the 19 analysts on Wall Street who currently cover Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) 12 have a ‘Hold’ rating on it with a consensus price target of $243.57, implying a 22.6% potential upside from the stock’s last closing price.7. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,242,721,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 7.09%                Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is the oldest stock pick of TCI Fund Management that still finds a presence in the fund’s 13F portfolio. TCI Fund Management had first reported initiating a stake in the ratings and analysis company in a regulatory filing for the last quarter of 2012. During Q2, TCI Fund Management upped its stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) by 14%. Other funds covered by us that also increased their holdings in the company during the same period included billionaire D. E. Shaw’s fund D E Shaw, which boosted its stake by 166% to 60,674 shares, and Dev Kantesaria’s Valley Forge Capital, which upped its holdings by 8% to 1.16 million shares.For its third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is scheduled to report its earnings on October 28. The current consensus among analysts is that the company would declare a GAAP EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $1.4 billion for that period. On September 27, analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while upping their price target on it slightly to $288 from $283, representing a potential upside of 16.8% from the stock’s last closing price.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,955,450,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 9.35%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Like Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another stock in which TCI Fund Management has held a stake for a long time and boosted its holding further – by 29% – during the second quarter. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) have been among the most consistent compounding stocks over the past several years. However, among funds tracked by Insider Monkey, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) ranks way ahead in popularity when compared to Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO).In its second quarter investors letter published recently, Investment management company Ave Maria had this to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI):“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a data-driven financial services company with leading franchises in the areas of data and analytics, credit rating, commodity insights and indices. S&amp;P Global benefits from several secular trends including the disintermediation of banks, a shift to passive investing, and an increased focus on ESG, Climate &amp; Energy Transition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:11 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio10 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks14 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

NEW YORK, Oct. 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced today that indicated dividend net changes (increases less decreases) for U.S. domestic common stocks increased $17.7 billion during Q3 2022, compared to $17.6 billion in Q2 2022 and $20.9 billion in Q3 2021.For the 12-month period ending September 2022, the net dividend rate increased $71.5 billion, compared to the net $61.4 billion in the 12-month period ending September 2021. Increases were $86.7 billion versus $71.8 billion, and decreases were $15.2 billion compared to $10.5 billion in the same period in 2021. ""Dividend increases continue at record levels. However, the strength of the increases has declined, as concerns over interest rates, inflation and slowing consumer spending have made companies more measured and cautious in their approach to dividend increases. At this point, Q4 appears set to slightly increase, setting another quarterly and annual record,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""The risk-reward tradeoff has shifted from the start of the third quarter, as the market decline has moved investors to more secure, less volatile equity dividend producing companies as dividends serve as anchors, slowing the decline.""Story continuesWithin the S&amp;P 500, Q3 cash dividends set a record payment, and were up 8.5% over Q3 2021. Dividends are expected to increase in Q4 and reach a new record, as the 2022 full year is expected to post a 10% increase in the actual cash payment over 2021.""2023 appears set for another record payment but the key question is by how much and the answer will depend on the state of the economy and corporate profits. The uncertain forecast for 2023 dividend payments is also driven by several factors: high inflation, rising interest rates, and the consumer pull back, as more market practitioners on Wall Street are signaling a 2023 recession. Overall, it is clear that companies are currently protecting their dividends, even if it means reducing buybacks,"" Silverblatt concluded.Buybacks, which set a record in Q1 2022 at $281 billion, declined in Q2 to $220 billion, with both Financials and Health Care issues pulling back on their expenditures. Buyback activity is expected to increase in the second half of 2022 as companies accelerate their purchases to avoid the new 1% buyback tax set to start in 2023.S&amp;P 500 DividendsOn a per share basis, S&amp;P 500 Q3 2022 dividend payments set a record, increasing 0.2% to $16.66 from Q2 2022's $16.63, and up 8.5% from Q2 2021 $15.36 payment. On an aggregate basis, index constituents paid $140.3 billion in dividends in the quarter, compared to $140.6 billion in Q2 2022 and up from $130.0 billion in Q3 2021.  For the 12-month period ending September 2022, the index paid a record $65.32 per share, up from $59.32 in the 12-month period ending September 2021, with an aggregate $552.4 billion to shareholders, compared to $498.9 billion in 2021.Additional findings from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices' quarterly analysis of U.S. dividend activity include:Dividend Increases (defined as either an increase or initiation in dividend payments):529 dividend increases were reported during Q3 2022 compared to 584 during Q3 2021, a 9.4% year-over-year decrease.Total dividend increases were $19.1 billion for the period, down from $22.2 billion for Q3 2021.For the 12-month period ending September 2022, 2,899 issues increased their payments, compared to 2,678 issues for the prior period, an 8.3% increase.Total dividend increases for the 12-month September 2022 period were $86.7 billion, up from $71.8 billion in the 12-month period ending September 2021.Dividend Decreases (defined as either a decrease or suspension in dividend payments):60 issues decreased dividends in Q3 2022, compared to 27 during Q3 2021, a 122% year-over-year increase.Dividend decreases were $1.4 billion in Q3 2022, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2021.In the 12-month period ending September 2022, 232 issues decreased their dividend payments, compared to 177 decreases in the 2021 period, a 31.1% increase.Dividend decreases were $15.2 billion in the 12-month period ending September 2022, a 44.9% increase from the $10.5 billion decrease in the same period in 2021.Non-S&amp;P 500 Domestic Common Issues (for issues yielding 10% or less):The percentage of non-S&amp;P 500 domestic dividend-paying common issues decreased to 19.4% in Q3 2022, compared to 20.0% in Q2 2022, and 20.0% in Q3 2021.The weighted indicated dividend yield for paying issues was 3.17% in Q3 2022, up from 2.98% in Q2 2021 and up from 2.52% in Q3 2021.

Cryptocurrencies have been a common target for theft, though. In fact, the crypto industry lost $428 million in the third quarter to hackers and fraud. That's according to a recent report from [?

Hey, David.DAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, [?

So effectively, the tool gives a color-coded risk rating to different crypto merchants. And the vendors or the pay-- the network issuers-- users, excuse me-- can sort of decide what they want to do from that standpoint. And the product is run by CipherTrace, which is a blockchain analytics firm which was acquired by Mastercard a little-- about a year ago.But as far as crypto fraud goes, fraud was $14 billion last year, according to Chainalysis. And that number is expected to drop this year, mostly due to the decline in cryptocurrency prices all together. But that being said, this latest effort by Mastercard is interesting in that, you know, given the high fraud and, as you pointed out, particularly high levels of theft this year, the company is looking to sort of be a trailblazer for banking compliance.- Well, certainly an interesting position for a lot of these crypto companies. The more transparency the better, at least for consumers. David Hollerith, thank you so much.]"

As a result, customers across China can receive international money transfers digitally into their bank accounts from their loved ones. The process of receiving the money transfers in discussion is enabled by a mini app integrated into Weixin called “Weihuikuan”.Each of the transfers that the Chinese customers will receive through Weixin can amount to a maximum $3000. Weixin users merely need to furnish their Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) and other required information in the ""Weihuikuan"" mini program for depositing funds into their bank accounts through digital means.The latest tie-up highlights Western Union’s sincere efforts to offer customers wider choices, speed, security and convenience in receiving money transfers. Its constant efforts to engage in partnerships for enhancing and digitizing the money movement process are also clearly reflected in the recent move.The newly-introduced service on Weixin hints at Western Union's intense focus on strengthening its presence across China. WU shows prudence in keeping a keen eye on China, which occupied one of the top five spots among the recipient of remittances across the globe last year, according to the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).China has been witnessing widespread digital penetration and a rising number of Internet users so far, providing Western Union with the perfect ground to capitalize on partnerships or technology investments.Western Union remains the preferred partner for conducting money transfers, considering its expansive worldwide reach into billions of bank accounts, including millions of wallets and cards spanning more than 130 countries. WU also has agent locations stretched across more than 200 countries and territories.Story continuesSimilar to Western Union, other companies like Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and MoneyGram International, Inc.

You pack your finest business casual, drop an apple (you won't eat) in your bag, and hop on a flight. Three airport tacos, one hotel check-in, and two shuttles later, and there you are, at the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in Orlando, Florida.If you're one of many women making this tech-wonder-land pilgrimage, you may be excited-meets-anxious about what to expect and what happens if you sign on the dotted line.According to three-time attendees Suhani Jain (Engineer, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.) and Muriel Hook (Engineer, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.), the first step is research and preparation. They should know since their GHC journey led them to their dream jobs. And today, they're spilling the beans on how to make the most of the celebration and what real life is like after the offer.Innovation, community, a place to growAs a computer engineering student at Georgia Tech, Suhani Jain attended career fairs, but nothing like the GHC. After hearing about it, the conference was on her radar for more than a year. When the time came, she submitted her resume online and attended with three like-minded roommates. But when they arrived, the aspiring engineers stepped into a show larger than life.""We realized we cannot show up and hope for the best,"" she recalls. ""So that night, we came up with a game plan.""Although software was her original career focus as a student, after learning about Qualcomm from other professionals, she shifted her sights because of our innovation leadership.""Qualcomm was one of the first booths on my list,"" she shares. ""I thought working on products with hardware components would be cool, and they offered ideal roles for where I wanted to take my career.""After the show, Suhani had an offer from a well-known company, yet her wish was for a job with Qualcomm. She was with friends when she got the call.Story continues""It was a California number. So, I'm like, ""Everybody, everybody just freeze! Just. Don't. Move,"" she excites. ""I answered, and I held back tears as they said, ""Hi Suhani. We would love to offer you a job."" As soon as I hung up, I was screaming and jumping.""But did life at Qualcomm live up to the hype?Since then, Suhani's vision has not only come to life, but it's also expanded, she reports. She was assigned a female executive mentor, struck a work-life balance, plugged into the support of the QWomen Engineer club, attended virtual happy hours and trivia contests, formed colleague relationships, moved to San Diego to get closer to the action, returned to her alma mater to pursue her master's degree online (with Qualcomm tuition reimbursement support), and went full-circle as one of our GHC representatives in 2020 and 2021.""I loved returning to Grace Hopper to help recruit,"" she adds. ""It was fun, and now that I'm all-in, I can share exactly how, as a global wireless technology innovator, we have endless opportunities for women in tech to express their career vision here.""Big small company, male alliesMuriel Hook was preparing to graduate from college when her now alma mater, Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department sponsored her to attend the GHC. And although she had the advantage of a pre-show interview with Qualcomm, naturally, she still felt the pressure to bring her A-game.""Interviewing is typically not a fun experience,"" she explains. ""But the Qualcomm interviewers made me feel comfortable.""Ultimately, Muriel joined us as a software engineer in 2020, and today she says the comfort-level remains. At Qualcomm Technologies, she clicked into a work community, connected with a mentor, and found support in unexpected ways.""We operate like a startup socially,"" she expands. ""I appreciate that our communication is open across levels, which is not common in large companies.""Today she's tapping into support offered by executives, managers, and male colleagues.""I have a lot of male allies at Qualcomm,"" she says. ""They make a point to echo my views or highlight my accomplishments in meetings. A lot of women struggle with getting their voice heard, but here, my male counterparts listen to me and make sure I get credit.""Visit Qualcomm at the GHCAfter two years of virtual events, we're sure you're as excited as we are to attend the GHC in person. And we have lots of exciting demonstrations and opportunities to share. Whether you stop by our booth for a SWAG bag, power up your device at our charging station, or network with us and other women in tech at our dinner, we're geared up for an exciting time of learning and fun.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Tech Stocks to Consider.Growth stocks are lagging in 2022 amid skyrocketing inflation and incessant rate hikes. As of September 30, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has lost 33% of its value year-to-date. Growth stocks have been beaten down to levels where they are presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Analyst Says: “Try To Get Great Names On Pullbacks”Senior securities analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, Barton Crocket, was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, where he discussed how investors can navigate the current market situation around tech stocks by investing in blue chip companies. He also talked about how now is an attractive entry point for long-term investors to own some of the top tech companies. According to Barton Crocket, investors “have to own tech” because “tech is the future”. Here are some comments from the analyst:“What I think we’re looking at is an environment where it’s more treacherous than really any time in many years to own tech. You’ve got valuation risk around higher interest rates, around slowing growth, you’ve got a plethora of new secular challenges…You have a lot of things to consider but you have to own tech right, so tech is the future. The question is how you navigate that, and I think you want to stick with and have some exposure to some of the best names at a reasonable valuation...”Barton Crocket was then asked if long-term investors should take up stakes in tech stocks before earnings season or wait for companies to report earnings. The analyst said that “clearly there’s increasing risk as we worry about the macro into the earnings reports” but “the stocks have reflected a lot of this already”. The analyst said that investors that are trying to time the market amid macro uncertainty can “miss an opportunity” and that they should instead “try to get great names on pullbacks”.Story continuesWhile the near term for tech stocks looks gloomy, they can become the highest returning components of your portfolio in the long term. Some of the top tech stocks to consider buying for the long-term include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

The company said the first phase investment of $20 billion, in Clay, New York, is planned by the end of this decade and that it will be the largest semiconductor facility built in the US. The chips will supply mobile devices, data centers and electric vehicles.The New York site, which will generate about 50,000 jobs in the state, including about 9,000 high-paying Micron positions, adds to the company’s previously announced manufacturing facility in Boise. In return, the company said it expects to get $5.5 billion in incentives from the state of New York over the course of the project.“As the first upstate governor in 100 years, this was a personal quest and failure was not an option,” said Governor Kathy Hochul at an event commemorating the announcement held at Syracuse University, which is near the proposed factory site. “We’re doing this for generations to come.”The so-called megafab chip factory complex is part of Micron’s strategy to increase DRAM production to 40% of the company’s global output over the next decade.CHIPS ActMicron’s commitment comes after the US government passed the CHIPS and Science Act in August, providing $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor research and development. The bill is at the center of the Biden administration’s effort to reduce dependence on Asian suppliers like Taiwan and South Korea, whose homegrown companies are leading the market, and to address supply-chain disruptions and resulting price hikes for certain goods containing semiconductors.Story continuesThe bill’s signing spurred US chip companies to plan billions of dollars in new investments. For example, Qualcomm Inc. is partnering with GlobalFoundries Inc., which also has a facility in New York state, in a $4.2 billion agreement to manufacture chips.“We will bring these jobs back to our shores and end our dependence on foreign-made chips,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. “This massive project will be built with union labor and high-paying jobs.”Micron Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said he was “deeply appreciative” of President Biden and his administration for making the CHIPS and Science Act a priority.“Today only 2% of the world’s memory is made here in the US, but we are going to change that,” Mehrotra said, outlining plans to help grow the US market share to 10% of the global supply in the next decade.Biden, in a statement, called the plant “another win for America” and pledged to build “an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, where we lower costs for our families and make it right here in America.”New York InvestmentSite preparation work for the chip factory will start next year and construction will begin in 2024. Production output will increase in the latter half of the decade, gradually increasing in line with industry demand, according to the statement from Micron.The site, near Syracuse, New York, could eventually include four 600,000 square foot cleanrooms, accounting for a total of 2.4 million square feet of cleanroom space – the size of about 40 US football fields.Hochul, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said the $5.5 billion in state tax incentives wasn’t a “blank check, you know, a hope, a wing and a prayer” and that tax credits would only be doled out after jobs are created.She said Micron’s investment “telegraphs that New York State is open for business” and will also draw further businesses across the chip supply chain. “This is a wise investment for New York because we’re in competition with every other state in the nation.”(Updates throughout with comment from Schumer, Hochul)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Massive Gas Field That Europe Can’t UseEven After $100 Billion, Self-Driving Cars Are Going Nowhere‘I Am Energy’: Inside the Bang Billionaire’s Reeling EmpireHackers Target Eager Homebuyers With a Dumb Scam That Keeps Working©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.73%.For the last reported quarter, PulteGroup came out with earnings of $2.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 per share, representing a surprise of 5.81%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.70 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.83 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.65%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PulteGroup lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesPulteGroup currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.75%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 25, 2022.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Medtronic Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.02bUS$6.15bUS$5.72bUS$6.62bUS$7.15bUS$7.49bUS$7.79bUS$8.06bUS$8.29bUS$8.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.85%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$4.7kUS$5.1kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.0%– 1.9%) = US$171bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$171b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$136b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$84.5, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.997. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Over the short, medium and long term, Europe now intends to reduce its reliance on Russian energy and increase its use of U.S. LNG.

(NYSE:CCI) insiders disposed of US$3.7m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-crown-castle-110044351.html,1664967644,STORY,['CCI'],"[Over the past year, many Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Crown CastleOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$193 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$150). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, Crown Castle insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Crown Castle Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Crown Castle insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Specifically, Independent Director Kevin Stephens bought US$121k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Insider Ownership Of Crown CastleI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Crown Castle insiders own about US$361m worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Crown Castle Insiders?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, Crown Castle insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Crown Castle has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

CCI are well-poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers. This is due to the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally.Moreover, wireless connectivity usage has significantly increased owing to the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet of Things. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have aided the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand.Consequently, the tower leasing demand has increased tremendously. This is expected to fuel the top-line growth of tower REITs.Also, with the increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless consumer demand is expected to escalate considerably.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle have been focusing on strategic acquisitions and development activities.In the second quarter, SBAC acquired 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil for total cash consideration of $127.3 million and built 100 towers. It is also under contract to acquire roughly 2,600 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Similarly, in 2021, AMT acquired Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, consisting of 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain. This provided the company with a significant scale in these attractive markets and enabled it to diversify its footprint with a strong, primarily tier-1, multinational tenant base.During the second quarter of 2022, AMT spent roughly $90 million on the acquisition of 118 communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets. These included 96 communications sites relating to its prior-announced agreement with Orange S.A. and fiber connected to its communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U.AMT’s development plan also assumes the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites across its international footprint.CCI, too, expects to double the rate of small cell deployments next year compared with the 5,000 nodes it anticipates putting on air in 2022, as 5G deployment is expected to require a greater scale of small cell deployment to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network.Further, these REITs have solid balance-sheet strength with ample liquidity and financial flexibility.

Boeing's high debt position hasn't helped investor sentiment either, particularly in a time of rising interest rates and given the uncertain timeline for FAA approval of the 737 Max 10.""We think this fear is misplaced,"" CFRA analyst Colin Scarola wrote in a new note about the concerns over Boeing's debt position.Here are more details from Scarola's aggressive call on Boeing:Price Target: $252 (reiterated)Rating: Strong Buy (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: +92%Why Scarola thinks concerns about Boeing's debt position are overblown""Boeing has no floating rate debt outstanding, meaning rising interest rates won't impact its earnings, all else equal,"" Scarola explained. ""Further, we expect the firm can repay all future debt maturities out of free cash flow without the need to refinance at higher rates.""The analyst added that ""even if our free cash flow projections miss, the firm can easily cover its $5.4 billion of debt maturities remaining in 2022 and 2023 by tapping into its large cash pile of $11.4 billion, again avoiding the need to refinance at higher rates.""Scarola: Boeing deliveries 'should rise regardless of recession'Although a recession would certainly impact demand for Boeing, Scarola suggested that the market may have gotten carried away in pricing a full-blown recession.""Another reason we think shares have been beaten down this year is fear that a global recession will keep the planemaker's delivery rates from recovering upward,"" Scarola wrote. ""We think this is wrong because delivery rates are already depressed... below severe recession levels by supply chain constraints. This means that as long as the labor and material shortages continue to taper, which we expect they will, Boeing deliveries should rise regardless of recession. To illustrate, in Q2, Boeing delivered 40 planes per month. But if the supply chain could handle the deliveries-to-backlog ratio it managed during 2017-2018, we estimate deliveries would be 60 per month.""Story continuesBoeing 737-8JP, from Norwegian (Andre Bjerke Livery) company takes off from the Barcelona airport on 26th June 2022. (Photo by Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Scarola also provided his outlook on the stock should a severe recession materialize.""We think a severe recession in aviation is unlikely given the healthy trajectory of travel demand, but if this did occur we estimate Boeing plane demand would fall roughly 15%,"" he said. ""This would result in demand for roughly 51 planes per month, 28% above the Q2 rate of 40. In addition to the high likelihood of Boeing deliveries rising strongly regardless of recession, we think the market is overlooking the potential near-term catalyst of a homegrown mRNA vaccine being approved in China. We think this would allow lockdowns to end and necessitate resumption of 737 MAX deliveries to Chinese airlines.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the clean energy sector in 2022, go directly and see 5 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In.The economic activity during and after the pandemic triggered price spikes for multiple commodities. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 added to the inflation crisis, causing drastic increases in energy prices and massive supply-chain disruptions. However, according to the Global Energy Perspective 2022 by McKinsey, the transition to a lower-carbon energy system continues to gain pace, and the incoming years are projected to witness a rapidly changing clean energy landscape. Following the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a grand total of 64 countries have followed the U.S. and have legislated in an effort to accomplish decarbonization goals in the next couple of decades. The Inflation Reduction Act facilitates upcoming decarbonization technologies, including hydrogen and EVs. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted an in-depth analysis into the future of the clean energy sector. It concluded that as the world combats the impending threat of climate change by facilitating the move towards a low-carbon future, companies which choose to compete within these transitional changes have the highest chances of profitability.Hence, it is reasonable to expect clean energy to be the future of the utilities and power sectors. It is for this reason that hedge funds are investing heavily in clean energy stocks, some of the most prominent being NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8.

Here are those reasons, with analysis from us at Yahoo Finance.""Treasury yields have backed off their recent highs. Two-years are down to 4.10% from the 4.32% highs on September 26th. Ten years are at 3.64%, well off the September 27 high of 3.96%."" That has put a bid under often leadership names in tech such as AMD, Amazon, and Apple.""Lower Treasury yields have stabilized currency markets. The euro is almost back to par with the dollar at 0.9983. The British pound has rallied from its V-bottom low on September 26 at $1.07, back to $1.15."" The U.S. dollar has eased off its recent highs this week, supporting share prices of multinationals such as Caterpillar and Microsoft.""Tuesday's JOLTS report suggests U.S. labor markets are seeing their first real signs of cooling."" U.S. manufacturing data earlier this week also showed an easing in economic activity and pricing pressure, spurring markets on the hopes the Fed would cool the pace of rate hikes sooner.""U.S. Q3 corporate earnings season starts next week, and estimates have come down enough (-6.6% since June 30) that companies should be able to beat Street numbers by a few percent."" Be careful with that one in light of recent dreadful financial warnings from FedEx, Nike, and Hasbro.""The next Fed meeting is not until November 2, so markets can focus on earnings rather than monetary policy."" Hawkish rhetoric from Fed members last week tanked the market, so less of their musings could bring further short-term relief to markets.Story continuesThat being said, investors remain on high alert for the resumption of selling given the precarious state of global economies and inflation-fighting tones among central bankers.The Federal Reserve remains the straw that stirs the drink in global markets as it continues a mission to stomp out inflation by aggressively hiking interest rates, which has set the pace for fellow central banks. That mission was reinforced in the past week by the tough-sounding commentary from various Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Lael Brainard.People ride in the ""Red Force"" roller coaster during the inauguration of Ferrari Land, at PortAventura resort, south of Barcelona, Spain April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYWall Street is now bracing for a policy mistake from central bankers.""We are increasingly worried about central banks making a policy error, and of new geopolitical tail risks,"" Marko Kolanovic, a top JPMorgan strategist, wrote in a new note to clients.The hawkish tone from the Fed has rippled across an array of asset markets, from the surging U.S. dollar to rising mortgage rates that are nearing 7%.And despite the strong start to October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remain mired in double-digit percentage declines for the year. Emerging markets remain under considerable pressure as well.""Our core view for choppy markets, up in quality and defensive positioning over the next six to 12 months, remains intact,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner warned in a note to clients. ""This global tightening cycle is set to weigh on economic growth well into 2023 given that monetary policy works with long and variable lags. Thus, even if the Federal Reserve (Fed) pivots or inflation softens in the fourth quarter, which may energize a risk-on rally, it likely does not change the downward trajectory of the economy and challenging market backdrop over the medium term.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:NKE) reported quarterly results last week that were not well received by the market. Shares declining almost 13% in the trading session following the release. In total, Nike is down more than 48% for the year.Nike's Gross Margin Is an Issue, but Shares Look UndervaluedWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEPeter Lynch Chart of NKENike has some issues in its business, but the stock is trading well below its GF Value. Lets look closer at the company and its most recent quarter to see why I believe Nike offers good value at this price.Quarterly highlightsNike reported first-quarter earnings results for its fiscal year 2023 on Sept. 29. Revenue grew 3.6% to $12.7 billion, beating Wall Street analysts estimates by $404 million. Excluding the impact of currency exchange, Nikes sales were higher by 10%. Net income of $1.5 billion, or 93 cents per share, compared unfavorably to $1.9 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the year-ago period. Earnings per share were 10 cents better than expected.Nike Direct sales grew 8% to $5.1 billion. This channel was up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Nike Brand Digital revenue was higher by 16%% on a reported basis and 23% excluding currency.By region, North America grew 13%, Asia Pacific and Latin America improved 5% (up 16% in constant currency) and Europe, Middle East and Africa was up 1% (up 17% in constant currency). Greater China fell 16%. The Converse brnad was up 2%.Merchandise markdowns and higher expenses for fright and logistics caused a 220 basis point decline in the gross margin to 44.3%. Inventory levels were up 44% to $9.7 billion.TakeawaysSeveral weeks ago, I opined that the market was offering a good entry point into Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE). That view was based on the companys previous quarter, where merchandise levels were higher, but the company wasnt discounting products in order to move them as demand remained elevated. As a result, the gross margin expanded 120 basis points last fiscal year. The most recent quarter has showed some cracks in my previous thesis.Story continuesFirst, the gross margin has contracted much faster than it did in the prior quarter as the company began to discount products at a much heavier rate in order to clear inventory that had built up. Much of the increase in inventory took place in North America, where supply chain constraints led to Nike carrying an increase in out-of-season products.Inventories remain high, though, even after the discounting activity, which means that markdowns will likely continue into the current quarter. Gross margins will thus be under pressure once again.Another headwind is Nikes performance in Greater China, which has been a real source of strength for the company historically. Sales for the region fell mid-double-digits, which comes on the heels of a 19% decline in the fourth quarter and a 5% decrease in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. The weakness in those quarters were largely attributed to Covid-19 restrictions, but those had mostly eased by the end of fiscal year 2022. Clearly, Nike is having difficulty in its most important growth region beyond just lockdowns.The third item that is impacting Nike is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which has railed more than 16% year-to-date. Much of this increase is due to aggressive Federal Reserve quantitative easing and quantitative tighening policies. With more interest rate hikes likely in the near-term, the dollar could rally further. More than 50% of Nike's revenue comes from international markets, so the company is likely to see continued pressure from currency exchange rates.Not all is lost, however. Management stated on the conference call that the company saw double-digit sales growth in the month of September as back-to-school shopping was robust. Some of the supply chain disruptions have been smoothed out, so markdowns may not persist much past the next quarter or two. A strong dollar hurts results, but the good news here is that demand remains very high in international markets outside of China, as currency neutral sales were all in the mid to high double-digit range. And in China, the decline in year-over-year sales has at least decelerated quarter-over-quarter.ValuationThe reduction in the share price has also brought the stock to a more reasonable valuation. Shares of Nike closed at $84 apiece on Oct. 3. Analysts project earnings per share of $3.02 this fiscal year, implying a forward price-earnings ratio of 27.8. Removing the artificially elevated multiple of 2020 due to Covid-19, the average price-earnings ratio has been just under 30 since 2012, according to Value Line. Thus, the stock is priced at a discount to its historical valuation.The GF Value chart rates the stock as significantly undervalued. Nike is trading at a 70% discount to its GF Value.Nike's Gross Margin Is an Issue, but Shares Look UndervaluedFinal thoughtsNikes stock was punished following the release of its fiscal first-quarter earnings, and maybe it needed the correction. The company had to mark down products in North America in order to begin right-sizing its inventory levels. Nike also continues to struggle in its most important growth region, and currency remains a headwind as well.The plus side is that Nikes stock is now more reasonably valued on a historical basis, and the discount to its GF Value is even steeper than it was last month. It might take the company several more quarters to get its inventory to lower levels, but Nike remains one of the worlds most well-known and valuable brands. For investors looking at the long-term, I believe Nike could be an excellent value proposition.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

NVAX faces challenges in securing a foothold in the COVID-19 vaccines market.Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine is also its first marketed product. However, the product launch was delayed by almost a year due to the postponement of the regulatory filing with the FDA. The FDA filing, supposed to have been done by management in May 2021, was completed after multiple delays in January 2022. This delayed filing resulted in a subsequent delay in emergency approval resulting in a substantial loss of market share for the company. Novavax secured emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for its COVID vaccine in July.This delayed product launch allowed other COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA to strengthen their position in the vaccines market. The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were also the first vaccines authorized by the FDA in 2020.In fact, this was also one of the likely reasons for management to slash the company’s total revenue guidance for 2022 from $4-$5 billion to $2-$2.3 billion at the second quarter conference call. Most of the population already completed primary vaccination using Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s approved mRNA-based vaccines.Compared to Novavax’s COVID vaccine, the mRNA-based COVID vaccines have also exhibited high efficacy rates. Furthermore, Novavax has started securing authorizations for its COVID vaccine in the United States. In contrast, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have already received full approval for their respective COVID-19 vaccines as a primary regimen in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for use in adults, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in adults and adolescents.The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States. A third and fourth booster dose of these vaccines have been authorized for certain age groups by the FDA. Novavax’s COVID vaccine is authorized in the United States as a primary two-dose regimen for adults and adolescents, while a regulatory filing is pending before the FDA seeks authorization for the vaccine’s use as a booster dose.Story continuesNovavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. Last month, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech secured EUA from the FDA for their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose. While Moderna’s Omicron booster is approved for individuals 18 years of age and older, Pfizer/Moderna’s version is approved for people 12 and older. These vaccines have been specifically developed to cater to the U.S. market, where the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 are the most prevalent variants.Novavax is also advancing its own Omicron-based COVID vaccine in clinical development. Management expects to initiate a regulatory filing with the FDA for this Omicron-specific vaccine candidate by 2022-end.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would appreciate the 3.1% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 3.5%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in International Business Machines. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.7% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that International Business Machines Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$90m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over International Business Machines. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with International Business Machines (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Tech Stocks to Consider.Growth stocks are lagging in 2022 amid skyrocketing inflation and incessant rate hikes. As of September 30, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has lost 33% of its value year-to-date. Growth stocks have been beaten down to levels where they are presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Analyst Says: “Try To Get Great Names On Pullbacks”Senior securities analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, Barton Crocket, was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, where he discussed how investors can navigate the current market situation around tech stocks by investing in blue chip companies. He also talked about how now is an attractive entry point for long-term investors to own some of the top tech companies. According to Barton Crocket, investors “have to own tech” because “tech is the future”. Here are some comments from the analyst:“What I think we’re looking at is an environment where it’s more treacherous than really any time in many years to own tech. You’ve got valuation risk around higher interest rates, around slowing growth, you’ve got a plethora of new secular challenges…You have a lot of things to consider but you have to own tech right, so tech is the future. The question is how you navigate that, and I think you want to stick with and have some exposure to some of the best names at a reasonable valuation...”Barton Crocket was then asked if long-term investors should take up stakes in tech stocks before earnings season or wait for companies to report earnings. The analyst said that “clearly there’s increasing risk as we worry about the macro into the earnings reports” but “the stocks have reflected a lot of this already”. The analyst said that investors that are trying to time the market amid macro uncertainty can “miss an opportunity” and that they should instead “try to get great names on pullbacks”.Story continuesWhile the near term for tech stocks looks gloomy, they can become the highest returning components of your portfolio in the long term. Some of the top tech stocks to consider buying for the long-term include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

(NASDAQ:MU) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)With the move, IBM will integrate the storage technologies from Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) as the foundation for IBM Spectrum Fusion. This combines IBM and Red Hat's container storage technologies for data services and helps accelerate IBM's capabilities in the burgeoning Kubernetes platform market.In addition, IBM intends to offer new Ceph solutions delivering a unified and software defined storage platform that bridges the architectural divide between the data center and cloud providers. This further advances IBM's leadership in the software defined storage and Kubernetes platform markets.According to Gartner, by 2025, 60% of infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) leaders will implement at least one of the hybrid cloud storage architectures, which is a significant increase from 20% in 2022.1 IBM's software defined storage strategy is to take a ""born in the cloud, for the cloud"" approach—unlocking bi-directional application and data mobility based on a shared, secure, and cloud-scale software defined storage foundation.""Red Hat and IBM have been working closely for many years, and today's announcement enhances our partnership and streamlines our portfolios,"" said Denis Kennelly, general manager of IBM Storage, IBM Systems. ""By bringing together the teams and integrating our products under one roof, we are accelerating the IBM's hybrid cloud storage strategy while maintaining commitments to Red Hat customers and the open-source community.""""Red Hat and IBM have a shared belief in the mission of hybrid cloud-native storage and its potential to help customers transform their applications and data,"" said Joe Fernandes, vice president of hybrid platforms, Red Hat. ""With IBM Storage taking stewardship of Red Hat Ceph Storage and OpenShift Data Foundation, IBM will help accelerate open-source storage innovation and expand the market opportunity beyond what each of us could deliver on our own. We believe this is a clear win for customers who can gain a more comprehensive platform with new hybrid cloud-native storage capabilities.""Story continuesAs customers formulate their hybrid cloud strategies, critical to success is the emphasis and importance of infrastructure consistency, application agility, IT management and flexible consumption consistency as deciding factors to bridge across on-premises and cloud deployments.With these changes to the IBM portfolio, clients will have access to a consistent set of storage services while preserving data resilience, security, and governance across bare metal, virtualized and containerized environments.  Some of the many benefits of the software defined portfolio available from IBM will include:A unified storage experience for all containerized apps running on Red Hat OpenShift: Customers can use IBM Spectrum Fusion (now with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation) to achieve the highest levels of performance, scale, automation, data protection, and data security for production applications running on OpenShift that require block, file, and/or object access to data. This enables development teams to focus on the apps, not the ops, with infrastructure-as-code designed for simplified, automated managing and provisioning.A consistent hybrid cloud experience at enterprise levels of scale and resiliency with IBM Ceph: Customers can deliver their private and hybrid cloud architectures on IBM's unified and software defined storage solution, providing capacity and management features. Capabilities include data protection, disaster recovery, high availability, security, auto-scaling, and self-healing portability, that are not tied to hardware, and travel with the data as it moves between on-premises and cloud environments.A single data lakehouse to aggregate and derive intelligence from unstructured data on IBM Spectrum Scale: Customers can address the challenges that often come with quickly scaling a centralized data approach with a single platform to support data-intensive workloads such as AI/ML, high performance computing, and others. Benefits can include less time and effort to administer, reduced data movement and redundancy, direct access to data for analytics tools, advanced schema management and data governance, all supported by distributed file and object storage engineered to be cost effective.Build in the cloud, deploy on-premises with automation: Customers can move developed applications from the cloud to on-premises services, automate the creation of staging environments to test deployment procedures, validate configuration changes, database schema and data updates, and ready package updates to overcome obstacles in production or correct errors before they become a problem that affects business operations.""IBM and Red Hat speaking with one voice on storage is delivering the synergies derived from IBM's Red Hat acquisition,"" said Ashish Nadkarni, group vice president and general manager, Infrastructure Systems at IDC. ""The combining of the two storage teams is a win for IT organizations as it brings together the best that both offer: An industry-leading storage systems portfolio meets an industry-leading software-defined data services offering. This initiative enables IBM and Red Hat to streamline their family of offerings, passing the benefits to their customers. It also helps accelerate innovation in storage to solve the data challenges for hybrid cloud, all while maintaining their commitment to open source.""Preserving commitment to Red Hat clients and the communityUnder the agreement between IBM and Red Hat, IBM will assume Premier Sponsorship of the Ceph Foundation, whose members collaborate to drive innovation, development, marketing, and community events for the Ceph open-source project. IBM Ceph and Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation will remain 100% open source and will continue to follow an upstream-first model, reinforcing IBM's commitment to these vital communities. Participation by the Ceph leadership team and other aspects of the open-source project is a key IBM priority to maintain and nurture ongoing Red Hat innovation.Red Hat and IBM intend to complete the transition by January 1, 2023, which will involve the transfer of storage roadmaps and Red Hat associates to the IBM Storage business unit. Following this date, Red Hat OpenShift Platform Plus will continue to include OpenShift Data Foundation, sold by Red Hat and its partners. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack customers will still be able to buy Red Hat Ceph Storage from Red Hat and its partners. Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenStack customers with existing subscriptions will be able to maintain and grow their storage footprints as needed, with no change in their Red Hat relationship.Forthcoming IBM Ceph and IBM Spectrum Fusion storage solutions based on Ceph are expected to ship beginning in the first half of 2023.Read more about today's news in this blog from Denis Kennelly, general manager of IBM Storage, IBM Systems: ""IBM + Red Hat: Doubling Down on Hybrid Cloud Storage""Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice and represent goals and objectives only.

187,95b120cd-8410-365d-a1a5-a8408cd92412,MPC,2022-10-05,Delek US Holdings (DK) Sees Growth Ahead Despite Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delek-us-holdings-dk-sees-142002812.html,1664893202,STORY,"['DLEKG.TA', 'DK', 'MUSA', 'MPC']","[Delek US Holdings, Inc. DK is a diversified downstream energy company with an impressive profile of strategically located assets. Its refineries have a combined crude throughput capacity of 302,000 barrels per day. The company also owns approximately 250 convenience stores in Texas and New Mexico locations as well as substantive logistics assets.The 2017 purchase of Alon USA Energy transformed Delek into a Permian-focused diversified downstream energy company with an opportunity for cash synergies. With 70% of Delek’s refining capacity leveraged to favorable Permian pricing, the company is poised for significant bottom-line growth.Of late, refiners (like Delek) have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing vaccinations and mobility. The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. As a reflection of this, Delek's 'Refining' segment’s contribution margin (refining margin minus operating expenses) rose sharply from just $14.1 million in the second quarter of 2021 to $618.3 million in the April-June period of 2022.The company’s retail segment also seems to be a bright spot. Since 2016, the unit’s adjusted earnings per store have witnessed a CAGR of 18%. What's more, Delek plans to add another 50 stores by 2025 to double its segment earnings to $100 million. Investors should know that the company is one of the largest licensees of 7-Eleven convenience stores in the United States.However, as a counter to these strengths, Delek is involved in a proxy battle with Carl Icahn's CVR Energy CVI, the owner of 15% of Delek’s outstanding common stock. CVR is pushing the Brentwood, TN-based firm to separate some of its assets to unlock more shareholder value. On the other hand, Delek sees CVR Energy as a competitor engaged in the business of petroleum refining and marketing that wants to further its own interests at the expense of Delek. We believe that a meaningful stock overhang is likely to remain unless the issue is resolved.Story continuesFurther, Delek’s financial metrics indicate that its leverage sits toward the top end of the high territory and is a massive negative for its shareholders. The long-term debt burden of the company stood at $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2022, which translates into a debt-to capitalization of 67.8% — a significant deterioration from 53% at the end of 2019 (before the downturn) and well above the sub-industry’s 36.3%.Finally, stock prices of oil refining companies are notoriously volatile. As such, shares of Delek may not be suitable for investors who are not comfortable with often substantial day-to-day volatility. In fact, Delek’s beta of 1.15 means that the company is more volatile than the overall market.In conclusion, investors are advised to stay put i.e., not to add or sell the stock at current levels.Stocks to ConsiderInstead, investors could look at stocks like Marathon Petroleum MPC and Murphy USA MUSA from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry.Marathon Petroleum: MPC posted robust Q2 results on Aug 2, with earnings per share of $10.61, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.17 and improving from a profit of merely 67 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its Refining &amp; Marketing segment, whose operating income totaled $7.1 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 108.4%. The company repurchased shares worth $4.1 billion during the May-July period and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Last year, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to the Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings — owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion. Apart from providing Marathon Petroleum with a much-needed cash infusion, the disposal of its Speedway-branded gas stations came with a supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will provide about 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.Murphy USA: MUSA came up with strong Q2 results on Jul 3, with EPS of $7.53 handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.35 and the year-earlier bottom line of $4.79. The outperformance could be attributed to a rise in the retail gasoline price and a higher retail margin of 34.9 cents per gallon, which was up 23.8% year over year. Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $6.8 billion surged 51.9% year over year and beat the consensus mark by $389 million, primarily due to improved petroleum product sales.Murphy USA’s unique high-volume low-cost business model helps it retain high profitability even in the fiercely competitive retail environment. The company, which sells more than 4 billion gallons of retail fuel annually, owns more than 90% of its gasoline stations. This allows Murphy USA to keep its operating expenses low. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract, thereby driving above-average fuel sales volume.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That production total represents a 67% jump from Q2, when it produced 4,401 trucks. The company produced around 2,500 trucks in Q1.CEO RJ Scaringe is focused on production gains and adding new shifts at the company’s lone factory in Normal, Illinois. The rising output has led the company to reiterate its 2022 annual goal of 25,000 vehicles produced for the quarter, despite component shortages the company noted earlier this year. Rivian’s initial annual goal was 50,000 trucks produced, which it later cut in half in March.While the stock is jumping on optimism, one Wall Street analyst isn’t buying the story just yet.“RIVN said it believes it is on track to deliver on its prior 2022 production guidance of 25,000 units. Doing so will entail improvement in Q4 (production of 10,683+ unit) and we continue to believe it will fall short,” CFRA analyst Garret Nelson said in a note.Workers lower an R1T truck body onto a chassis in the assembly line, April 11, 2022, at the Rivian electric vehicle plant in Normal, Illinois. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Nelson also believes the current environment remains difficult for startup EV companies because they are “several years from achieving profitability.” Those capital constraints, coupled with competition from established names like Ford, GM, and Tesla, will make it difficult for Rivian to succeed and become profitable, at least in the near term, Nelson added. CFRA maintains its Sell rating and $25 12-month price target.For the Rivian bulls, a big part of the growth story is the second plant the company intends to open in Georgia in the next two years, where it plans to build its cheaper R2 series of vehicles. However, those plans were dealt a blow recently.In a court ruling late last week, a local Morgan County judge denied $15 billion in bonds meant for construction of the plant in Rutledge, Georgia.Judge Brenda Trammell ruled Thursday that the Joint Development Authority (JDA), an organization that seeks to attract businesses to the region, could not prove construction of the Rivian factory would be “sound, reasonable, and feasible,” meaning the company is not eligible for the bonds.Story continuesJudge Trammell also ruled Rivian would have to pay traditional property taxes, which it was originally excluded from paying.“We basically were able to prove that we were only going to get $44 million the way the contract was written,” said JoEllen Artz, one of the organizers of a local opposition. “But if it was actually taxable … the two counties would get over $700 million in property taxes.”The JDA and its partner the Georgia Department of Economic Development said they would appeal the judge’s ruling.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The leading snacks company’s effective pricing actions are working. The company is keen on expanding its business through acquisitions.Let’s delve deeper.Portfolio Strength Fuels GrowthHershey’s core brands — Hershey’s, Reese’s, Hershey’s Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Brookside, Sofit and Ice Breakers — have been growing strongly on the back of advertising investments, in-store merchandising, and programming and innovation. The company regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio.On its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects increased inventory levels, advertising and merchandising to fuel everyday sales and share performance in the second half of 2022. It expects seasonal consumer engagement with high single-digit sales growth during Halloween and the holiday season. In addition, it is committed to supporting brands through solid media marketing.Pricing Power: UpsideHershey is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve performance. In the second quarter of 2022, net price realization contributed 9.5 points to net sales growth, fueled by higher list prices and reduced levels of promotional activity. In the North America Confectionery segment, net price realization contributed 9.8 points of growth, led by higher list price increases and reduced promotional activity. In the North America Salty Snacks segment, net price realization contributed 14.6 points to the upside. Price realization contributed 3 points to sales in the International unit.Strategic Acquisitions: Key DriverHershey has been undertaking buyouts to augment portfolio strength and boost revenues. In December 2021, Hershey acquired Dot’s Pretzels LLC — the owner of Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, a leading brand in the pretzel category. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels is a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. The company purchased Pretzels Inc. from an affiliate of Peak Rock Capital. The acquisition further expands Hershey’s production capabilities.On Jun 25, 2021, Hershey concluded the acquisition of Lily's, a leading better-for-you (BFY) confectionery brand. The buyout was in tandem with Hershey’s focus on creating an impressive BFY confection portfolio as part of its multipronged better-for-you snacking strategy. In the second quarter of 2022, net sales included a 5.3-point benefit from the Pretzels, Dot's and Lily's buyouts.Story continuesOther Food Companies Benefiting From AcquisitionsSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. HRL acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.McCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Coming back to Hershey, the abovementioned upsides are likely to keep the company well placed.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As part of its efforts to expand operations across the trans-Atlantic, DAL will have 8% more available seats in the coming summer than in the same season of 2022.In the summer of 2023, Delta will operate flights (either new or resumed after the pandemic) to destinations like London-Heathrow, Paris, Geneva, Stuttgart and Berlin. Expressing delight on the impending expansion, Joe Esposito, Delta’s senior vice president of Network Planning, said, “With nearly 620 weekly flights and connectivity to 32 destinations in Europe and beyond, customers will have a wealth of iconic destinations to explore and an unmatched journey to enjoy across the pond.”Delta’s trans-Atlantic schedule from New York JFK next summer will be the largest ever, including more than 220 weekly departures to 26 destinations. As part of this schedule, DAL will operate daily flights between Gatwick and New York JFK from Apr 10, 2023. The carrier has not operated flights on the route since 2008.DAL will resume daily service to Berlin from JFK on May 25. Also, for the first time since 1993, the airline will fly to Geneva from New York JFK. Also, the airline will boost its operations to Rome by adding a third seasonal flight from May 25. The flight to Rome will operate daily.From Atlanta, Delta will add 11 flights a week to three trans-Atlantic destinations. As part of the expansion from Atlanta, DAL will operate seasonal flights (five times a week) to Edinburgh from May 25. It also aims to bolster its trans-Atlantic operations from Los Angeles. The services include flights to Paris from May 8, marking the resumption of the route post-pandemic.  It will also fly to London-Heathrow from Mar 25, 2023, for the first time since 2015.The move to expand trans-Atlantic capacity seems prudent, given that passenger revenues are rising with the rebound in air-travel demand. Delta’s revenues in second-quarter 2022 came in at $13,824 million, which not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,608.9 million but also soared 94% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Story continuesTo highlight the buoyancy in air-travel demand, let’s recap the top-line performance of two other U.S. carriers.At American Airlines AAL, operating revenues were $13,422 million in the second quarter, increasing 79.5% year over year. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,409.8 million. This massive year-over-year jump reflects upbeat air-travel demand. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected in the 12.2% increase in total operating revenues from the second-quarter 2019 actuals despite operating at an 8% lower capacity.In the June quarter, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (91.1%), increased to $12,223 million from $6,545 million a year ago, driven by strong summer-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front.At United Airlines UAL, operating revenues of $12,112 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,033.7 million in the second quarter. Revenues increased more than 100% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the total operating revenue increase of 6.2% from the second-quarter 2019 levels.The massive year-over-year increase in United Airlines’ top line was driven by more than a 100% rise in its passenger revenues (accounting for 89.4% of the top line) to $10,829 million.

Sales have been slowing and that is worrying retailers. However, even then, they are banking heavily on the upcoming holiday season, which like every year, is expected to boost retail sales.Retailers are thus leaving no stone unturned to make the most of the holiday season. Although the sector is faced with several challenges, including soaring commodity prices, retailers are trying their best to ramp up sales during this period. Several retailers this year plan to launch early holiday deals, while others are on a hiring spree to meet the surge in demand during that period.Aggressive HiringThe retail sector has been struggling with sales slowing month over month for quite some time. However, a modest but 0.4% jump in retail sales in August ahead of the holiday season is a good sign for the worried retailers. Although rising prices have been impacting retail sales over the past few months, the sector has still managed to fight back as higher demand for goods has been driving sales.Besides, the industry is facing several other challenges. Supply-chain crisis and higher freight charges are also hindering smooth sales. However, retailers are hopeful for a great holiday season.Holiday season sales account for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers and are one of the most important sales windows. And this holiday season might not be as bad for the retail sector as was initially anticipated. The annual holiday retail estimate from Deloitte predicts a 4-6% increase in retail sales.Spending will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion between November and January. Sales during the holiday season last year totaled $1.49 trillion, a 15.1% increase from 2020. Given that everyone is wary about spending this year, the prediction is quite low, but the good thing is that even then, sales are expected to rise quite significantly.Story continuesThis has made retailers optimistic, and they are once again going on a hiring spree. Retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Target Corporation TGT will be launching early holiday deals, which will begin in October.Target Corporation plans to hire 10,000 seasonal workers ahead of the holiday season to meet customers’ demands during that period. TGT is also back with its ‘Target Deals Day’ with the aim of luring more customers to buy essentials and must-have products. This time, Target Corporation will start the ‘Target Deals Day’ on Oct 6, which will continue till Oct 8.Moreover, for those who look for the best deals, TGT is coming up with “Holiday Price Match Guarantee.” The offer will start on Oct 6 and continue through Dec 24. Target Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS too is aggressively hiring workers for the upcoming holiday season. DKS plans to hire at least 9,000 heads ahead of the holiday season. DICK’s Sporting Goods has been doing well despite the sector facing several challenges because of its both strong online and offline presence. Given that a lot of people plan to travel this year, DKS expects sales of its athletic wear to grow during the holiday season.Walmart Inc.

Due to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, the company has the capability to gain market share. Its commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales. The company’s everyday low-price model is attracting customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid the soaring inflation.Striking the Right Chord With CustomersDollar General’s initiatives, such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet, should benefit the top line. The company has been sparing no effort to bolster omnichannel operations and ramp up delivery services to provide customers with a frictionless shopping experience. Its partnership with DoorDash continues to yield results, with same-day delivery now available at more than 13,300 stores at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Regarding the company’s transformational initiatives, DG Fresh is designed to enable the self-distribution of fresh and frozen products. Meanwhile, Fast Track aims at increasing labor productivity in stores, enhancing customer convenience and improving on-shelf availability.Under DG Fresh, the company has been expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items. In the second quarter, the company installed more than 17,000 cooler doors across its store base and plans to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in fiscal 2022. The company completed the initial rollout of DG Fresh across the entire chain and is now delivering to nearly 19,000 stores from 12 facilities.Concerning Fast Track, the company has been expanding its self-checkout facility, which was available in approximately 10,000 stores at the end of the second quarter. The company plans to expand this offering to a total of up to 11,000 stores by the end of the current fiscal year. Additionally, the non-consumable initiative offering was available in nearly 15,000 stores. The company plans to complete the rollout of the non-consumable initiative offering across the entire chain by the end of fiscal 2022.Store Growth PlansDollar General has been making prudent investments relating to store infrastructure, store openings, expansions, remodels and relocations to drive revenues. The company opened 227 new stores, remodeled 533 stores and relocated 30 stores in the second quarter. The company anticipates carrying out 2,930 to 2,980 real estate projects, including 1,010 to 1,060 store openings, 1,795 remodels and 125 store relocations in fiscal 2022.In the second quarter, the company opened 14 new pOpshelf locations, which took the total count to 80. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, the company had a total of 32 store-within-a-store concepts, a smaller pOpshelf store in Dollar General’s larger format stores.Management reaffirmed its plan to nearly triple the pOpshelf store count and open additional 15 store-within-a-store concepts. This will result in about 150 stand-alone pOpshelf locations and a total of approximately 40 store-within-a-store concepts by the end of fiscal 2022. The company is targeting approximately 1,000 pOpshelf stores by the end of fiscal 2025.Wrapping UpDollar General’s differentiated product range resonates well with customers’ spending habits. The company, which shares space with Target TGT, Costco COST and BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ, is making every effort to enhance guests’ experience via unique store concepts, affordable and convenient assortment and other innovations.A Synopsis of Other StocksTarget has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. Target has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the ever-evolving retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line. Target intends to spend $5 billion or more in the current fiscal year to continue scaling operations.Costco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register impressive sales numbers. Costco’s net sales grew 15.2% year over year to $70,764 million, while membership fees increased 7.5% to $1,327 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.BJ's Wholesale Club’s ability to steer the tough retail environment validates its strong customer value proposition and business model. Its relentless efforts to boost the membership base, simplify assortments, enhance digital capabilities and accelerate club openings should support sales. BJ's Wholesale Club’s total comparable club sales jumped 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

If you want to skip the fund’s history, recent performance and details about its overall portfolio, please go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn.Billionaire Sir Chris Hohn is the founder of The Children’s Investment, or TCI Fund Management, a London-based hedge fund. Mr. Hohn was born in 1966 in Addlestone, Surrey, in a working-class family. His father was a car mechanic, and his mother was a legal secretary. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in accounting and business economics from the University of Southampton. On being advised by one of his tutors at the University of Southampton, Mr. Hohn applied to the Harvard Business School (HBS) for an MBA. At HBS, he graduated among the top 5% of his batch, becoming one of the Baker Scholars, the institution’s highest award for academic achievement. He worked at multiple noted PE and hedge funds in New York and London for a few years before setting up TCI Fund Management in 2003.TCI takes a long-term, value-oriented approach while investing and strongly focuses on environmental, social and governance issues. It is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, with over $50 billion in assets under management.Mr. Hohn is also a well-known philanthropist, having donated billions of dollars to charitable causes over the years. He is a founder and major supporter of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a UK-based charity that works to improve the lives of children in developing countries. He has also given large sums of money to educational causes and environmental causes.Mr. Hohn is well known on Wall Street and in the financial center of London for his aggressive negotiating style. He has been involved in a number of high-profile battles with companies, including a successful campaign to force the reform of the London Stock Exchange. He is also a passionate supporter of greater disclosure of information by companies and has been critical of the way in which some banks have operated in the past.Story continuesFor his philanthropic contributions, Mr. Hohn was knighted in 2014. The Children’s Investment Fund Management has generated strong returns since it was founded. In 2021, the fund generated a return of 23.3% for its investors, making it the sixth of the past seven years when TCI reported double-digit gains.TCI Fund Management’s Portfolio The value of TCI Fund Management’s 13F portfolio declined to $31.6 billion at the end of Q2 from $36.84 billion at the end of March. Because the fund has always run a concentrated portfolio, there was not much churning seen in TCI Fund Management’s portfolio during Q2.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) continued to be among TCI Fund Management’s top 10 stock picks at the end of Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris HohnChris HohnOur MethodologyAt Insider Monkey, we cover the portfolios of 895 hedge funds, closely tracking the stocks they buy and sell. We selected the ten stocks discussed in this article based on the 13F regulatory filing submitted by TCI Fund Management with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30. These are the top ten picks of Hohn's fund, according to its second quarter portfolio.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $172,633,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was the only stock among its top stock picks in which  TCI Fund Management initiated a new stake during Q2. Founded in 1967, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is among the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the world. Due to macro uncertainty and supply chain issues the semiconductor industry has been facing in the last few quarters, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) recently got featured in Insider Monkey’s list of 5 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Uncertainty Grows.One of the major reasons TCI Fund Management decided to buy the stock during the second quarter could be the drastic decline it has suffered this year. Having lost close to 48% of its value year-to-date, Applied Materials, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock currently trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of only 10.95.On September 28, analysts at Barclays reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while reducing their price target to $85 from $95, which represents almost no potential upside from where the stock is currently trading.9. Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $940,029,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.97%    Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Although TCI Fund Management reduced its stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) by 10% during the second quarter, the stock’s popularity among smart money investors saw a massive jump during that time. From just 21 hedge funds among those covered by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) at the end of March, the number jumped to 32 at the end of June. Funds that initiated a stake in the company during the second quarter included billionaire Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Ken Heebner’s Capital Growth Management, and Jinghua Yan’s TwinBeech Capital.Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP), as the name suggests, is based in Boston, Massachusetts and is currently the country’s largest publicly-held developer and owner of Class A office properties. It focuses on five major property markets in the country: Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC. On September 20, Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) announced that it had acquired a six-story life sciences property with a total area of 271,000 square feet adjacent to Kendall Center from Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). The gross purchase price of this deal was around $592 million, and Biogen has leased the property back from Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) and will continue to occupy the premise until April 2028.8. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $1,120,178,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Railroad major Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) stock seems to be following the trajectory of a roller coaster this year. Having started the year near the $200 level, it reached its lifetime high of $278.94 in May, but has pared all that gain as it currently trades flat year-to-date. Why following smart money can reap rich rewards for ordinary investors can be gauged from how smart money has played this stock. Between mid-2017 and the first quarter of this year, when the stock rose from $100 levels to $250 levels, hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) climbed from 49 to 90. However, that number fell all the way down to 65 in just one quarter.On September 15, executives at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and other railroad majors breathed a sigh of relief. After many months of negotiations, US railway workers and companies finally reached an agreement averting a potential strike that could have caused another logistical nightmare like what we saw post-COVID. Out of the 19 analysts on Wall Street who currently cover Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) 12 have a ‘Hold’ rating on it with a consensus price target of $243.57, implying a 22.6% potential upside from the stock’s last closing price.7. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,242,721,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 7.09%                Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is the oldest stock pick of TCI Fund Management that still finds a presence in the fund’s 13F portfolio. TCI Fund Management had first reported initiating a stake in the ratings and analysis company in a regulatory filing for the last quarter of 2012. During Q2, TCI Fund Management upped its stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) by 14%. Other funds covered by us that also increased their holdings in the company during the same period included billionaire D. E. Shaw’s fund D E Shaw, which boosted its stake by 166% to 60,674 shares, and Dev Kantesaria’s Valley Forge Capital, which upped its holdings by 8% to 1.16 million shares.For its third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is scheduled to report its earnings on October 28. The current consensus among analysts is that the company would declare a GAAP EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $1.4 billion for that period. On September 27, analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while upping their price target on it slightly to $288 from $283, representing a potential upside of 16.8% from the stock’s last closing price.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,955,450,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 9.35%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Like Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another stock in which TCI Fund Management has held a stake for a long time and boosted its holding further – by 29% – during the second quarter. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) have been among the most consistent compounding stocks over the past several years. However, among funds tracked by Insider Monkey, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) ranks way ahead in popularity when compared to Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO).In its second quarter investors letter published recently, Investment management company Ave Maria had this to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI):“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a data-driven financial services company with leading franchises in the areas of data and analytics, credit rating, commodity insights and indices. S&amp;P Global benefits from several secular trends including the disintermediation of banks, a shift to passive investing, and an increased focus on ESG, Climate &amp; Energy Transition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:11 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio10 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks14 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, today's pop has put the equity in line with a historically bearish moving average that could see its upward efforts stalled.The trendline in question is Ross Stores stock's 180-day moving average, which the shares just came within one standard deviation of after trading well below it for much of the year. Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, five similar signal have been observed in the last three years.

CCI are well-poised to benefit from increased capital spending by wireless carriers. This is due to the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally.Moreover, wireless connectivity usage has significantly increased owing to the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet of Things. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have aided the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand.Consequently, the tower leasing demand has increased tremendously. This is expected to fuel the top-line growth of tower REITs.Also, with the increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications, such as machine-to-machine connections, social networking and streaming of video, wireless consumer demand is expected to escalate considerably.To capitalize on this upbeat trend, American Tower, SBA Communications and Crown Castle have been focusing on strategic acquisitions and development activities.In the second quarter, SBAC acquired 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil for total cash consideration of $127.3 million and built 100 towers. It is also under contract to acquire roughly 2,600 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Similarly, in 2021, AMT acquired Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, consisting of 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain. This provided the company with a significant scale in these attractive markets and enabled it to diversify its footprint with a strong, primarily tier-1, multinational tenant base.During the second quarter of 2022, AMT spent roughly $90 million on the acquisition of 118 communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets. These included 96 communications sites relating to its prior-announced agreement with Orange S.A. and fiber connected to its communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U.AMT’s development plan also assumes the construction of approximately 6,500 new sites across its international footprint.CCI, too, expects to double the rate of small cell deployments next year compared with the 5,000 nodes it anticipates putting on air in 2022, as 5G deployment is expected to require a greater scale of small cell deployment to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network.Further, these REITs have solid balance-sheet strength with ample liquidity and financial flexibility. This supports their expansionary efforts to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fewer donations. Supply chain issues. Skyrocketing prices. All part of a recipe for disaster for the nation's food banks.Unless a key ingredient - community action - is added to the mix.""The surge in grocery and gas prices - at the same time many COVID-19 programs and waivers are expiring - means a perfect storm of challenges for our food bank and for the people we serve each day,"" said Jessica Whichard from the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, a Feeding America affiliate. ""We've expended about eight times our usual amount to purchase and distribute food, with our primary focus on shelf-stable items that are really hard to keep in place.""Whichard and her teammates are not alone. A recent Feeding America survey found 90% of responding food banks working through an increased or steady demand for services amid the nation's largest 12-month grocery price hike since 1979.The Harvest Regional Food Bank in Texarkana, Arkansas, is one of them.""Our pre-pandemic distribution hovered around 2.5 million meals annually and increased to over 5.5 million meals in 2020,"" said Camille Coker Wrinkle, executive director and CEO of the fellow Feeding America affiliate. ""Over the past couple of years, that number has leveled off to an estimated four million meals annually. We feel that's the ‘new normal.'""Regions Bank and its teams are doing their part to help during Hunger Action Month in September. Feeding America established Hunger Action Month in 2008 as a nationwide initiative encouraging people to become proactively involved with the hunger crisis.Associates in Raleigh recently presented a $2,500 contribution to the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, on top of volunteering in the food bank's warehouse. Terry Hoey, Mid-East Mortgage production manager and market executive for Regions in Raleigh, believes supporting basic needs like hunger relief is especially critical.Story continues""As we hopefully find ourselves on the other side of a global economic and health crisis, real challenges of housing instability and food insecurity continue to impact our Raleigh neighbors,"" said Hoey. ""Our business model as a company revolves around everyone pulling together to serve clients. That same ‘everyone pulling on the rope' approach to volunteerism shows how we can also create a greater impact for people in our communities.""Commercial Banking relationship specialist Cindy Forrester is a repeat volunteer. The chance to give back gives her a sense of fulfillment; it offers other benefits, too.""When you volunteer, you get to meet new people and have fun with the associates you work with,"" said Forrester. ""We work hard, but we still have a lot of fun. I enjoy the camaraderie.""Regions' Texarkana market is presenting Harvest Regional Food Bank with a $2,500 donation. The affiliate serves people and families in nine counties across Southwest Arkansas and in Bowie County, Texas, many in rural and underserved areas.""We know that one in every five of our neighbors in Southwest Arkansas and Northeast Texas was facing food insecurity prior to 2020, meaning they didn't have adequate and reliable access to healthy food,"" said Clay Roberts, market executive for Regions Bank in Texarkana. ""For 25-plus years, the Harvest Regional Food Bank has been distributing millions of pounds of food among dozens of food pantries, shelters and schools. They've been compassionate, good neighbors, and we're honored to be good neighbors to them in return.""While the unrelenting challenges since 2020 could be perceived as gloom and doom, it's anything but according to both affiliates. Each has uncovered new ways to approach serving clients. Ways they anticipate will continue.""The drastic and sudden changes to the way we provided hunger relief actually provided us with a good opportunity to evaluate what worked well and how we could incorporate those changes into our long-term plans,"" said Wrinkle.That includes continuing a drive-through model of food distribution at select sites; working with more senior centers to provide food boxes to their clients since transportation can be a barrier; and implementing health care partnerships to provide on-site pantry services, particularly for those who face chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.""The big ‘aha moment' for us was leveraging some of the new partnerships formed out of COVID to provide hunger relief to people in the places they will most likely be,"" explained Wrinkle.Jessica Whichard says the same is true in serving their North Carolina clients.""Home delivery of our senior boxes has been really effective, and we're exploring ways to continue providing that,"" she said. ""We also gained efficiencies by pre-ordering, pulling and loading food for our community agency partners. We're very fortunate to be in a place to have funds available to shift and remain nimble in how we can get food out the door while strengthening our programs to actually end hunger.""The challenges may be greater. But so is the resolve.

Visa (V), which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this global payments processor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.14%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Visa was expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, but it reported $1.98 per share instead, representing a surprise of 13.79%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.65 per share, while it actually produced $1.79 per share, a surprise of 8.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Visa, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Visa currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.17%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

As a result, customers across China can receive international money transfers digitally into their bank accounts from their loved ones. The process of receiving the money transfers in discussion is enabled by a mini app integrated into Weixin called “Weihuikuan”.Each of the transfers that the Chinese customers will receive through Weixin can amount to a maximum $3000. Weixin users merely need to furnish their Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) and other required information in the ""Weihuikuan"" mini program for depositing funds into their bank accounts through digital means.The latest tie-up highlights Western Union’s sincere efforts to offer customers wider choices, speed, security and convenience in receiving money transfers. Its constant efforts to engage in partnerships for enhancing and digitizing the money movement process are also clearly reflected in the recent move.The newly-introduced service on Weixin hints at Western Union's intense focus on strengthening its presence across China. WU shows prudence in keeping a keen eye on China, which occupied one of the top five spots among the recipient of remittances across the globe last year, according to the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).China has been witnessing widespread digital penetration and a rising number of Internet users so far, providing Western Union with the perfect ground to capitalize on partnerships or technology investments.Western Union remains the preferred partner for conducting money transfers, considering its expansive worldwide reach into billions of bank accounts, including millions of wallets and cards spanning more than 130 countries. WU also has agent locations stretched across more than 200 countries and territories.Story continuesSimilar to Western Union, other companies like Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and MoneyGram International, Inc. MGI resorted to creating a solid digital arm for capitalizing on robust demand for hassle-free money transfer services.Mastercard is firmly focused on collaborating with global and regional financial service providers to upgrade the money movement process for consumers and businesses. MA continues adhering to a digital partnership strategy and undertaking significant investments to enhance its digital capabilities.Visa facilitates seamless and secure transfer of funds on a real-time basis worldwide.

MAR is likely to benefit from unit expansion efforts, pent-up demand and the loyalty program. Also, its focus on hotel conversion opportunities bodes well. However, a decline in revenue per available room (RevPAR) from the pre-pandemic levels is a headwind.Let’s delve deeper.Growth CatalystsMarriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. During the second quarter, the company added 97 new properties (16,917 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio. Also,  the company announced an agreement with Vinpearl to open eight hotels in Vietnam. The deal is expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. MAR plans to expand its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands.Meanwhile, Marriott is focusing on hotel conversion opportunities to mitigate the impact of construction delays caused by the pandemic. In 2022, Marriott anticipates net room growth in the range of 3-3.5%. The hotel company is also trying to strengthen its presence outside the United States, especially in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The company’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue going forward.Marriott has been gaining from the reopening of international borders and leniency in travel restrictions. Throughout the second quarter of 2022, the company witnessed a steady increase in demand in the United States, Canada, the Middle East and Africa regions. The company benefited from robust leisure demand and business and cross-border travel improvements. It also reported a strong RevPAR recovery in Europe. With global trends improving, the company expects the recovery momentum to continue in the future. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment, lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders (in most markets) are likely to aid the company in the upcoming periods.The company is benefiting from the robust growth of its loyalty program. With nearly 169 million members globally, the company’s loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy plays a supporting hand in its marketing strategies. Also, the company is engaging its customers with promotional offers such as grocery and retail spending accelerators on its co-branded credit cards (American Express and Chase). In July 2022, the company unveiled a new credit card in China and reported solid feedback. During the second quarter of 2022, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from 2019 levels. Backed by solid customer acceptance for credit card programs coupled with a rise in credit card average spending, the company anticipates higher contributions from credit card fees in 2022.Story continuesConcernsMarriott — which shares space with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT, Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC and Hyatt Hotels Corporation H in the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry — has been affected by the coronavirus crisis. During the second quarter of 2022, strict COVID policies and lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing weighed on travel demand. Also, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages added to the downside. Although most properties have lifted or eased restrictions, RevPAR is still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels. The company expects demand to remain uneven in the near term.A Brief Review of the Other StocksHilton is benefiting from its focus on expansion, luxury development strategy and digital efforts. The company is gaining from robust leisure demand and business and cross-border travel improvements. During second-quarter 2022, the company witnessed solid RevPAR gains in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region on account of easing travel restrictions. With global trends improving, the company expects the recovery momentum to continue in future periods. The company anticipates system-wide 2022 RevPAR to increase between 37-43% (compared with the previous projection of 32-38%) on a year-over-year basis.Marriott Vacations continues to witness robust recovery during second-quarter 2022. While both occupancies and tours are witnessing growth in the second quarter, VPGs remain well above the 2019 levels. The company reported benefits from its development and rental businesses. During the second quarter of 2022, the company reported solid occupancies with respect to its Aqua-Aston business. Also, it reported a solid recovery in domestic markets (Hawaii) and Asia-Pacific. Going forward, much optimism prevails as the company noted increasing customer willingness to resume travel.Hyatt is benefitting from a gradual increase in demand, new hotel openings and acquisition initiatives. Also, increased focus on loyalty programs bodes well. With continued ease-of-travel restrictions and improvements in airlines, the company noted solid demand from both leisure and business travelers alike. The company is optimistic with respect to the Apple Leisure Group acquisition on account of robust business and technological optimization.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In 2020, Murdoch resigned from the board of News Corp, citing disagreements over editorial content at the company founded by his father, a conservative media mogul.Fox News, a television network spun out of News Corp., has been a fierce critic of Biden's presidency and amplified false claims that former President Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election. The station is being sued by Dominion Voting Systems for defamation over election coverage.In recent weeks, Biden has brought in millions of dollars for Democratic candidates, party officials say, contributing to a record level of fundraising in a midterm year.He has spoken at a wide array of venues that include a tent filled with donors behind a house in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Manhattan living room of mathematician Henry Laufer, where guests sat listening to Biden in their socks to avoid soiling the carpet.Biden remains a big draw among wealthy Democrats and has boosted fund-raising efforts in spite of lackluster job approval numbers. The events also aim to convince deep-pocketed Democrats that Biden, 79, is the right candidate for a 2024 presidential run despite his age.Story continuesWhile there remain questions as to whether Biden will seek a second term, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Biden ally, told his National Action Network staff recently that Biden told him he does plan to run again in 2024, NBC News reported on Monday.""I'm going to do it again,"" Biden told Sharpton, NBC News said.An official with the Democratic National Committee said that with Biden's assistance, it has raised a midterm record $271 million during the current election cycle and more than $107 million so far this year, ""the most at this point in any year.""

230,740bac25-5e82-31b6-a0a1-65d6ee7d8f84,VZ,2022-10-05,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-130001042.html,1664888401,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -5.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, indicating a change of -9.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.29 indicates a change of +1.9% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $136.33 billion and $138.29 billion estimates indicate +2% and +1.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $33.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.1%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.16%. The EPS surprise was -2.24%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over time, the company has expanded its product offerings, geographical reach, technological expertise and customer base through inorganic initiatives.Stanley Black has divested several of its businesses to focus on key areas of growth. In July 2022, SWK divested its Security Business to Securitas AB for $3.2 billion cash. The company expects to fund debt reduction with net proceeds from the divestiture. In the same month, it divested its Access Technologies Business to Allegion ALLE, a provider of security products and solutions, for $900 million in cash.The acquisition has enhanced Allegion’s access, egress and access control solutions offerings. The buyout has broadened its reach to high-growth segments.The acquisition enables Allegion to provide a comprehensive line of automatic entrance solutions to its commercial and institutional clients. The transaction strengthens its Americas core business and helps accelerate delivery and efficiency through its expanded service center footprint and wider distribution capabilities.Coming back to Stanley Black, apart from divesting assets, the company focuses on strategically acquiring businesses to drive growth. In December 2021, the company acquired Excel Industries and an 80% stake in MTD Holdings (SWK had already acquired a 20% stake in MTD Holdings in 2019). The transaction boosted channel opportunities, strengthened innovation capabilities and enhanced product offerings for Stanley Black. In second-quarter 2022, acquired assets boosted Stanley Black’s sales by 24% year over year. The Excel and MTD buyouts boosted the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s sales by 28%.Within the broader Industrial Products sector, Zebra Technologies ZBRA has been successively acquiring businesses to strengthen its operations. In June 2022, the company acquired Matrox Imaging, which enables it to combine fixed industrial scanning and machine vision portfolio with the latter’s expertise in the imaging market.In October 2021, Zebra Technologies acquired antuit.ai, complementing the planning and demand forecasting module for its retail software portfolio. This buyout and the launch of fixed industrial scanning and machine vision portfolio strengthen ZBRA’s position in the consumer products industry.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Tech Stocks to Consider.Growth stocks are lagging in 2022 amid skyrocketing inflation and incessant rate hikes. As of September 30, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has lost 33% of its value year-to-date. Growth stocks have been beaten down to levels where they are presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Analyst Says: “Try To Get Great Names On Pullbacks”Senior securities analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, Barton Crocket, was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, where he discussed how investors can navigate the current market situation around tech stocks by investing in blue chip companies. He also talked about how now is an attractive entry point for long-term investors to own some of the top tech companies. According to Barton Crocket, investors “have to own tech” because “tech is the future”. Here are some comments from the analyst:“What I think we’re looking at is an environment where it’s more treacherous than really any time in many years to own tech. You’ve got valuation risk around higher interest rates, around slowing growth, you’ve got a plethora of new secular challenges…You have a lot of things to consider but you have to own tech right, so tech is the future. The question is how you navigate that, and I think you want to stick with and have some exposure to some of the best names at a reasonable valuation...”Barton Crocket was then asked if long-term investors should take up stakes in tech stocks before earnings season or wait for companies to report earnings. The analyst said that “clearly there’s increasing risk as we worry about the macro into the earnings reports” but “the stocks have reflected a lot of this already”. The analyst said that investors that are trying to time the market amid macro uncertainty can “miss an opportunity” and that they should instead “try to get great names on pullbacks”.Story continuesWhile the near term for tech stocks looks gloomy, they can become the highest returning components of your portfolio in the long term. Some of the top tech stocks to consider buying for the long-term include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD), Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) and Discover Financial Services (DFS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Air Products and Chemicals shares have held up better than the peer group as well as the broader market, with the stock down -2.9% over the past year vs. -8.7% decline for the Zacks sub-industry and -15% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The Zacks analysts discusses the challenges facing the company like the impact of higher power and fuel costs on margins and currency headwinds, but sees Air Products' strong cash flows and history of shareholder returns offsetting these issues. Strategic investments in high-return projects, new business deals and acquisitions are expected to drive the company’s results in fiscal 2022. Also, Air Products is committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong cash flows. It will also benefit from productivity actions. The acquisition of PBF Energy plants is also contributing to its results.(You can read the full research report on Air Products and Chemicals here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Southern Copper shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous  industry over the past year (-15.1% vs. -13.3%). The company anticipates copper production in 2022 to be lower year over year reflecting the suspension of operations at Cuajone as well as temporary reduction in ore grades.Production is expected to recover in 2023 and reach 971,000 tons with the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production at Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista. Its strict cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.Even though copper prices have declined lately, it will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States and the global initiatives to address climate change. This will support Southern Copper's top-line performance. Backed by industry-leading copper reserves as well as growth investments, the company is well poised to continue delivering solid results.(You can read the full research report on Southern Copper here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Discover Financial shares have declined -26.4% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry’s decline of -38.0% on the back of rising macroeconomic worries. Exacerbating the macro headwinds are the company’s weak margins outlook and expectations of rising provisions for loan losses.However, Discover Financial’s integrated digital banking and payments model, as well as the ongoing economic recovery is buoying its performance. Expanding global payments operations and an attractive core business poise the company well for growth.Several digital transformation efforts bode well for DFS. Its strong balance sheet is a major positive, highlighted by a healthy liquidity portfolio. The company's solid financial position enables it to deploy capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.(You can read the full research report on Discover Financial here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Ventas, Inc.

""Our extensive zero-emissions portfolio is how we will meet varied customer demands across the hardest-to-abate industries and make the energy transition possible.""""With Cummins all-new X Series platform, we are taking the internal combustion engine to a next generation level, capable of meeting future ultra-low emission standards together with a low-to-zero carbon fuel capability to help put fleets on a lower cost path to decarbonization,"" added Alison Trueblood, Cummins Executive Director - On-highway Business Europe.One key zero-emissions product Cummins revealed at IAA was the company's fourth-generation hydrogen fuel cell platform. Designed for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses, the fuel cell technology is available in 135 kW single and 270 kW dual modules.Scania in Europe and Daimler Trucks North America have each announced collaborations with Cummins to develop and integrate these next-generation fuel cell platforms into demonstration vehicles. The systems use fourth-generation variable pressure to provide easier system integration into vehicles. The systems also have strong operating cycle efficiency and durability for a lower total cost of ownership.""We know our customers have diverse needs and complicated duty cycles to support, which is why we focus on continued innovation and improvement,"" said Amy Adams, Vice President of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies at Cummins. ""We're developing hydrogen fuel cell technology that demonstrates the capacity and flexibility required to meet or exceed the power needs for on-highway commercial vehicles - proving hydrogen as a viable solution to decarbonize the economy.""Story continuesMeanwhile, the fuel-agnostic architecture of the 15-liter X Series uses a common base engine with cylinder heads and fuel systems specifically tailored for the X15H to use carbon-free hydrogen and for the X15N to use biogas with up to 90% carbon reduction. With X15H ratings up to 530 hp (395 kW) and X15N ratings up to 510 hp (380 kW), they are ideally suited for trucks up to 44-ton gross vehicle weight (GVW).The next generation X10 diesel engine with up to 450 hp (335 kW) output extends heavy-duty robustness down to a 10-liter displacement, offering low weight and a compact installation for vehicles across the 26-to-44 ton GVW range focused on maximizing payload, as well as low-cab trucks for urban operations. The X10 design incorporates a similar fuel-agnostic capability to that of X15, with the potential to offer hydrogen and biogas versions.""Equally impressive as the environmental credentials of the X Series are a significant increase in power density and a more compact installation envelope providing truck manufacturers with the opportunity to enhance their vehicles,"" Trueblood said. ""A further benefit of the X15 and X10 engine is a modular architecture for global applications, in terms of adapting to vehicle configurations, varying emission regulations and customer preferences.""IAA takes place every other year to display the latest in transportation.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cummins (CMI) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.98 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 1, 2022.CMI has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.82.CMI is one of just a large database of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Tesla (TSLA).Slated to report earnings on October 19, 2022, Tesla holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.99 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor Tesla, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.92 is 7.84%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CMI and TSLA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In 2020, the global economy faced the risk of a prolonged depression and a slump in spending, a spike in unemployment and massive supply chain disruption.Today the picture is uncertain, but I still think it is far better for Disney than it was in March 2020. For a start, Disney has made a huge success of its streaming service. Its amusement parks are also back up and running again, and it remains one of the most iconic brands in entertainment.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISThe companys outlook is improving Though Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is still dominating the streaming market in terms of overall subscriber base with nearly 220.7 million subscribers, Disney+ is catching up rapidly. It has acquired 152.2 million subscribers since launching in 2019 and it does not look as if this growth is going to slow any time soon.As Netflix is struggling to maintain its growth, consumers are still flocking to Disneys offering. Disneys streaming service, Disney+, gained 14.4 million subscribers in the second quarter, compared to Netflixs loss of just under 1 million subscribers.Still, the company is continuing to recover from the pandemic. With revenues from its theme parks still recovering, Wall Street analysts have pencilled in earnings per share of $3.85 for 2022 rising to $5.43 in 2023. That is still far below the $7.23 per share reported for 2018 and $6.24 for 2019.Notably, Disney has not restored its dividend, which it cut in 2020 to conserve cash. Analysts do not expect the payout to return until 2023 based on earnings growth projections.Look to the long term This begs the question, does Disney deserve to be undervalued, or is the stocks slump just a reflection of the markets wider malaise? It seems it is the latter in my view. Shares of Disney have traded around 15 to 20 times forward earnings predictions for much of the past five years. Today, based on Wall Street estimates, the stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.9. That suggests shares are neither cheap nor expensive.Story continuesHowever, in the past two years, the stock has looked expensive, trading at a price-earnings ratio as high as 100 at some points. This was due to a combination of the market bubble, Disney's drop in earnings due to the theme park closings and investments in the currently unprofitable Disney+.Based on these numbers, it appears as if the markets view of Disney has reverted to the mean after two explosive years. This could present an opportunity for value investors who can look past current market conditions to the long term.Disney has not lost its competitive advantages. In fact, one could argue that thanks to the growth of Disney+, its advantages are only more entrenched. Consumers know and love the brand, and they are willing to pay a premium to get access to its services and watch its programs. In a harsh economic climate, these advantages are vital.The real question we need to be asking is not if Disney is expensive, but if the companys competitive advantages are under threat. Based on the information we have today, I would argue they are not.This makes it easier to assess if the business is a good value. Assuming the company's moat remains in place, I see no reason why it cannot grow earnings at least in line with inflation in the long run.In the 10 years to 2019, Disney had achieved compound annual earnings growth of 12%. If it can return to this trend, I estimate the company could be significantly undervalued at current levels, a theses which is supported by the GF Value chart:Walt Disney: Look to the Long TermThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

OneView, Roku's ad platform built for TV streaming, is directly integrated with Nielsen's measurement solution, enabling robust, person-level measurement of ad campaigns on the Roku platform.As marketers are shifting to TV streaming, this collaboration will make measurements simpler and more accurate and also build upon a longstanding relationship between Roku and Nielsen.Roku’s Library Aids its GrowthRoku is benefiting from strong momentum in average revenue per user (ARPU) and improving user engagement. ARPU was $44.10 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting an increase of 21% year over year, while active accounts were 63.1 million, reflecting an increase of 14% year over year.This is primarily because Roku has been focusing on expanding its portfolio on The Roku Channel and also Roku Originals.It recently added 14 new linear channels, of which the local news channels seemed to gain the most traction. These newly launched channels that offer a wide range of genres like Westerns, Spanish-language entertainment and true crime are expected to drive viewers’ interest and increase active accounts.Roku also continues its momentum on Roku Originals. The second season of Chrissy’s Court was the highest-rated unscripted Roku Originals launch ever and delivered four times more unique views than the first season.The upcoming feature film, WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story, which is scheduled to be released on Nov 4, is anticipated to attract advertisers due to the new opportunities to engage with Roku Originals.During NewFronts, the company announced two new co-production deals with Marquee Brands and Milk Street Studios, giving the Roku Channel over 3,000 episodes of library content as well as seven new original series starring food and lifestyle personalities Martha Stewart, Emeril Lagasse and Chris Kimball.Roku anticipates revenues in third-quarter 2022 to rise 3% year over year to $700 million.What Lies Ahead for Roku?Despite investing in growing its library, Roku faces challenges from the macroeconomic environment such as inflation, recessionary fear and supply chain issue.

But content does remain king. And Disney comes through with a strong roster of its own properties and franchises. Joining us now to discuss media matters is Jessica Reif Ehrlich, B of A securities senior media and entertainment analyst.Jessica, great to catch up with you. Thank you for being here. And I know that you're still positive overall on Disney. But I want to cut straight to one of the reasons behind your cut. And that is a lower number of subscribers to Disney Plus. You're saying you're lowering your projected Disney Plus net additions to 8 million. What's the main reason behind that?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: The company guided to core Disney Plus subs in the US are growing this quarter. So we have a modest growth of 1 million-plus. But really this is just a segue because the company gets its content paid in stride in the current quarter, which is fiscal Q1, the December quarter. So we expect subs to pick up pretty substantially. The goal is to have 100 original film and TV shows per year, or roughly 2 per week. And that really will drive Disney Plus subs going forward. It's just a lull period.- Jessica, when does Disney Plus reach profitability?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: They've hit peak losses. And the company should reach profitability in fiscal '24. So we're technically in fiscal '23. So next year. But we expect in a full year basis it will be fiscal '25.- And it seems that a lot of that might also be based on the entrance of this new ad-supported tier and what the demand looks like there. Where are you starting to see that actually come into play, given that Netflix has even pulled forward their own schedule for that ad-supported tier?Story continuesJESSICA REIF EHRLICH: We are super positive on the AVOD tier, or the ad-supported tier. So Disney just announced that they are raising prices for the subscription only, or SVOD, by 38% in the US. That's a pretty big increase for any service. But it's still only $10.99. They have a huge umbrella to raise prices because everybody else is so much higher. Their AVOD, or subscription plus advertising service, will be $7.99. So there's a $3 differential.And we believe demand is so strong for the Disney Plus product that the ARPU, or the revenue they generate per month per user, will be higher on the AVOD tier ultimately than on SVOD. So we know that there's massive demand by advertisers. The advertising inventory will be limited. Let's say 5 minutes per hour versus 15 minutes plus on linear. But it will be targeted and addressable. And it expands the reach of the Disney Company from the linear networks to streaming. There's very little overlap between the two. So it's actually really exciting.- I wonder, within the broader streaming options that are out there, we've continued to look at, of course, year over year the digital media trends survey that Deloitte puts out and the average number of different platforms that an individual or household might subscribe into. Are you expecting some of the average figures for the number of services that people are buying into to start to come down? And where would Disney sit within that mix?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: Disney will be at the top of the pyramid in our view. Disney has a very broad portfolio. If you look at their services, Hulu and ESPN Plus combined with Disney Plus, they have it all. They have news, sports, general entertainment, kids, adults, films, et cetera. So we expect them to be at the top. How many services people take ultimately is still an unknown.Most consumers and most viewers watch five to seven channels. And the five to seven I watch are different than the five to seven my husband watches and different from what our kids watch. So it's just not clear how many services per home people will take. But we think that Netflix, Disney-- we'll see what happens when Warner Brothers Discovery comes out with their combined service next year, which will also be a very broad service, how that shakes out. But those would be Disney Plus we think-- or Disney overall will be at the top of the pyramid.- Jessica, there has been some criticism, I guess, of some of the franchises that are out there. And Disney, of course, has really made a lot of its franchises and obviously spun off a lot of content from its franchises. You pushed back against that view in your recent note. You say franchises are basically where it's at.JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: Look, this is content that consumers know. So Disney has done an amazing job with expanding the Marvel universe. And they've just-- so there's more characters. There's more stories. They just have a very deep IP to work with. And that's an advantage versus any of the FAANG companies. This is an advantage Warner Brothers Discovery has, all of the traditional media companies have. They have content that consumers know and love.And they also have more platforms, whether it's linear and streaming, to advertise content over, but they have more assets, including theme parks. So Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, has Universal theme parks. And Disney, of course, has the Disney theme parks on a global basis. And they can use these franchises for content right across all of their assets, which is an incredible advantage.- Jessica Reif Ehrlich, B of A security senior media and entertainment analyst joining us this morning. Thanks so much.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including The Walt Disney Co., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walt Disney shares have underperformed the broader market this year (-39.1% vs. -24.8%) on the back of sentiment shift about the streaming business that had earlier helped the stock move higher. Other issues in the Disney story have been the adverse impact of coronavirus on theme park business, higher programming and production costs at Linear Networks, heavy investments on Disney+, and a leveraged balance sheet.However, the company is benefiting from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Availability in the Nordics, Latin America and other Asian territories is helping it expand its user base. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Kimberly-Clark's shares have declined -10.0% over the past six-month period against the Zacks Consumer Products – Staples industry's decline of -28.0%. The Zacks analyst believes that Kimberly-Clark has been battling high input costs for a while now. The same persisted in the second quarter of 2022, with operating profit declining due to a rise in input costs to the tune of $405 million. Management expects adjusted operating profit to be down mid-single digit percent during 2022. Key input costs are estimated to escalate $1.4-$1.6 billion in 2022.Story continuesNonetheless, the company has been benefiting from its three growth pillars. These include focus on improving its core business in the developed markets, speeding up growth in the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhancing digital and e-commerce capacities. Apart from this, the company's pricing and saving initiatives have been aiding amid a rising cost environment.(You can read the full research report on Kimberly-Clark here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Barrick Gold shares have underperformed the Zacks Mining – Gold industry over the past year (-15.0% vs. -8.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company's higher costs might dent its margins in 2022. Uncertainties surrounding the pandemic may impact demand for gold over the short term. Gold prices are also expected to remain volatile over the near term and are likely to be affected by interest rate hikes in 2022. Weaker copper prices are another concern.However, the company is expected to gain from progress in key growth projects that are likely to contribute to production. Barrick's debt-reduction actions are also expected to lower interest expenses. It has a strong liquidity position and is focused on boosting shareholders' returns by leveraging solid cash flows. Moreover, Barrick's merger with Randgold and joint venture with Newmont provides additional upsides.

The industry bore the brunt of the closure of dental practices and lower patient visits due to the risk of exposure to the virus and more focus on COVID-related treatments.However, digital orthodontics has been gaining traction lately. It offers advanced teeth straightening options while safeguarding dentists from the contagious virus.This subsegment of dental treatment entails the improvement of the arrangement and appearance of protruding, crowded or crooked teeth. It also pertains to correcting problems related to misaligned bites.Growing TrendGoing by a Fortune Business Insights report, the global clear aligners market size was $2.41 billion in 2020, exhibiting lower growth of 4.4% compared with the average year-over-year growth from 2017 to 2019.However, the market has experienced substantial recovery, primarily owing to the easing of restrictions and mass opening up of the economy in 2022. Apart from this, rising dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Robotics and teledentistry and an increase in the number of patient visits are likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. The latest technologies are helping orthodontic surgeons in carrying out minimally-invasive procedures that ensure precision and efficiency, thereby reducing patients’ trauma. The industry players actively promote digital workflows for general dentistry and dental specialties. Further, dental 3D printers are revolutionizing dentistry. These reduce time and cost through efficient utilization of orthodontics and dental practices.Accordingly, going by the same report, this industry is projected to grow from $2.85 billion in 2021 to $10.04 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 19.7% in the forecast period 2021-2028.Orthodontics players like Align Technology ALGN, SmileDirectClub SDC and DENTSPLY SIRONA XRAY are likely to gain from the changing opportunities within the orthodontic space.Story continuesStocks to WatchAlign Technology: In September 2022, Align introduced Invisalign Virtual Care AI, its next-generation remote monitoring solution with new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities that streamline workflows for doctors and their staff. It has features like patient enrollment, setup, and review directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site without the need to use separate standalone solutions. Prior to this, the company announced its new Invisalign systems innovations for the Align Digital Platform. These latest innovations include ClinCheck Live Update for 3D controls, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan, or IPP, and the Invisalign Smile Architect.In terms of 3D scanners, in the last-reported second quarter of 2022, the number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions reflected the continued adoption of digital scanners and a larger installed base. Total worldwide intraoral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q2 increased to 88.4% from 82.2% in the year-ago period.SmileDirectClub: Realizing the enormous prospects of this space, SmileDirectClub has extended its teledentistry platform to dental and orthodontic offices through a collaborative model, designed specifically for dentists who currently do not offer an orthodontic product to patients, and an office-directed model, designed for orthodontists and dentists as a traditional in-office clear aligner product. The company is currently providing a doctor-directed digital end-to-end experience in teledentistry, with 24/7 access to orthodontic care and the back end of a lifetime smile guarantee. The company continues to see favorable industry dynamics with broader acceptance of telehealth and specifically, teledentistry.The company continues to see growth in the adoption and use of teledentistry by the dental and orthodontic industries. This is further boosted by the expansion of the company’s professional partnerships and well-established and respected national DSOs, which demonstrate the adoption of telehealth by the dental community.DENTSPLY SIRONA: In a bid to revolutionize digital-implant workflow in dental care, DENTSPLY’s single tooth replacement solution — Azento — needs special mention. It revolutionizes the digital implant workflow by restructuring implant-planning service, purchase and delivery. Management remains optimistic about the long-term potential of the company’s digital dentistry and workflow management as it is well positioned with respect to the diagnostic expertise of its X-ray portfolio, which is critical for implants. DENTSPLY has been witnessing a rising trend in dental offices, upgrading from 2D to 3D units, which has also been observed in all global markets. In the last fiscal, digital diagnostic devices like Primescan, Axeos and Orthophos delivered solid growth. In three years, the company scaled its clear aligners from having no presence in the digital diagnostic space to a business that delivered $274 million in 2021.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Overall, Peacock’s active user accounts is now at 30 million, he said, up more than 3 million in the September quarter.“If you have the right content, and you offer a broad distribution platform, your consumers are going to find you — and that’s what we’re doing with Peacock,” Shell said.The Q3 growth is an improvement over the second quarter — when Peacock’s paid customer based was flat at 13 million and Peacock’s overall active accounts actually declined by about 1 million.One of the drivers for Peacock’s turnaround, according to Shell, is that NBCU now has rights back from Hulu for current seasons of NBC shows as well as Bravo series the day after they air.“All of our content that’s on NBC, Bravo, our other channels for the first time… is coming to Peacock, where it used to go to Hulu,” Shell said. “So if you want to watch ‘Saturday Night Live,’ if you want to watch ‘Real Housewives,’ if you want to watch ‘The Voice,’ all of our ‘Chicago’ shows… all of those are coming to Peacock.”In addition to the next-day rights, Peacock last month clawed back dozens of past seasons of NBCU programming, including the entire run of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”Shell also touted Peacock’s sports rights, including NFL and Premier League games, WWE, the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Big Ten Conference games starting in 2023. On the movie front, he cited the strategy to put Universal Pictures films directly on Peacock after their transactional home-video windows. Those included “Minions,” “Jurassic Park Dominion” and “Black Phone” in Q3, with others coming in the fourth quarter like Jordan Peele’s “Nope” and “Halloween Ends” (which is launching day-and-date on Peacock and in theaters).Story continues“That construct of the windowing combined with the fact that streamers really want movies… has in my opinion made the movie business economically better than it’s been in the entire time since I’ve been in the movie business,” Shell said.Other programming coming to Peacock includes a “Community” movie, along with nonexclusive rights to all six seasons of the sitcom (the first five of which originally aired on NBC).Comcast reported that Peacock had an operating loss of $1.7 billion in 2021, and it expects that to grow to $2.5 billion in 2022. The cable and media giant is scheduled to report Q3 2022 earnings on Thursday, Oct. 27, before the market opens.Shell also addressed the question of whether NBC will cut the 10 p.m. hour of primetime and return the timeslot to affiliates. “I don’t think we’re ready to make any decision on 10 o’clock… but we are looking to reallocate resources,” he said. “Right now, we have a lot of great shows at 10 o’clock, we make a lot of money at 10 o’clock” but Shell added that “as linear declines you have to make some trade-offs.”During the CNBC interview, Shell said that NBCU would be interested in owning all of Hulu (it currently owns 33%), although he conceded that Disney is not interested in selling it — echoing comments that Comcast chief Brian Roberts made at an investment conference last month, who opined that Hulu would fetch a premium if Disney were to auction it off. “We, like a lot of other people, would want to own Hulu,” Shell said. “That’s not what we anticipate happening, but it’s a pretty valuable asset.”CNBC is owned by NBCU. The interview with Shell was conducted by CNBC’s David Faber, who joked at the beginning of the segment that it’s “always a pleasure to interview your boss’ boss’ boss’ boss.”VIP+ Analysis: What Everyone Gets Wrong About PeacockBest of VarietyConstance Wu Gets Candid in Revealing New Memoir 'Making a Scene'The Best Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2022: From 'House of the Dragon' to 'Euphoria'What's Coming to Netflix in October 2022]"

The 2022 UCaas and CCaaS Market Trends Study sheds light on the rising imperative among businesses to standardize and consolidate their corporate collaboration strategies – using bundled solutions to remove IT complexity from today’s digital interactions among distributed workforces and customers. The full report is available to download here.The latest study found success requirements for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) and Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) have evolved since the 2020 report with consolidation and integration becoming more important. Two years ago, the top criteria for ensuring successful deployments were data security and network reliability. This year, integration has broken into the top tier with near-equal significance. Of the more than 200 senior IT leaders surveyed:91% say data security is critical or very important90% say network reliability is critical or very important89% say integration is critical or very important""For UCaaS and CCaaS to work well, they must function as core elements in a larger ecosystem, harmonizing communications, connectivity, and cybersecurity — the trifecta for digital transformation,"" said Rudy Tibuni, Director, UC Solutions, Masergy. ""These three disciplines can no longer operate in silos. They must come together to create a more secure, resilient, and efficient environment to support excellent employee and customer experiences.""Under the pressures of the pandemic, companies added a hodge-podge of collaboration applications to quickly meet the needs of cloud calling, virtual presence, chat, and video conferencing. The inefficiency of redundant applications is quickly coming into focus for IT leaders as they seek to make hybrid work models sustainable for the future. But there’s another reason the idea of integration is rising in importance — the sheer volume of systems and technologies required to make collaboration work well.Story continuesSignaling additional essentials for consolidation, SIP trunking and bundled solutions are also rising in demand. Use of SIP trunking with UCaaS/CCaaS has increased over the past two years (63% versus 51% in 2020). Additionally, the preference for bundled, pre-integrated UCaaS/CCaaS solutions has grown stronger since 2020 (65% versus 51% in 2020).""Senior IT decision makers are pointing to a new integration imperative, consolidating UC around one toolset to untangle complexities in the wake of multiple applications and multi-cloud services,"" said Tibuni. ""To effectively connect people, corporate communications tools and their supporting systems must all work as a cohesive collective. Businesses should standardize on their preferred cloud collaboration platform and seek holistic solutions that intersect with SIP trunking and secure network connectivity, including SD-WAN and SASE.""The 2022 UCaaS and CCaaS Market Trends Study also revealed:Companies can’t afford a collaboration failure: 9 out of 10 IT leaders say UCaaS/CCaaS downtime is highly concerning or detrimental to their business — up from 8 out of 10 in 2020UCaaS adoption is rising amidst changing times:97% of organizations say remote work has increased interest in UCaaS/CCaaS47% of organizations have implemented UCaaS/CCaaS, up from 40% in 202075% of respondents report increased use of Microsoft TeamsⓇIT agility is the biggest driver: Respondents state the single biggest factor driving their UCaaS/CCaaS investment is increasing their IT flexibility and agility (41%)Foundry’s CIO, the executive-level IT media brand providing insight into business technology leadership, conducted the research on behalf of Masergy.

The new cloud native portfolio of analytics solutions combines network function data with machine learning and artificial intelligence to help operators make more informed, automated decisions around the performance and stability of their entire 5G network core. The first offering in the suite, Oracle Communications Network Data Analytics Function is available now. With the offering, operators can quickly identify anomalies that can cause catastrophic network function failures and impact customer service. See the Analytics Suite in action at Network X Amsterdam, booth G24, October 18-20, 2022.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Driving innovation with insights from trusted data and enriched analytics is not only critical to compete in today's marketplace, but game changing in the way service providers can achieve greater cost efficiency, improve quality of service, and carve out new revenue streams, explains Andrew Morawski, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications, Networks. ""Our 5G Network Analytics Suite harnesses Oracle's cloud and network experience into a powerful toolset that helps operators better manage and optimize their 5G networks.""Optimizing 5G networks with the Network Data Analytics FunctionBased on cloud native computing foundation (CNCF) principles and supporting 3GPP standards, the Network Data Analytics Function is a containerized microservices-based architecture and managed by Kubernetes. It serves as a key data and analytics repository with standard interfaces to store and share information that can support use cases across the entire 5G network.The offering aggregates historical and real-time data such as control signaling measurements, the state of network functions, congestion, and quality of service, all in one, intuitive dashboard. By applying machine learning, predictive analytics and AI to this data, service providers can better understand how their 5G core is performing and make better decisions around any actions that need to be taken. This enables carriers to streamline operations and network planning based on insights generated from current, predicted, and even simulated events in their network.Story continuesWith the offering, CSPs can build automation into applications to monitor and audit software components. This supports anomaly detection to avoid events such as network function failure that could result in degradation of network quality. The offering can also support network monetization with data and insight sharing to third-party developers to create new services.And because it is based on open standard interfaces and supports both private and public environments and multi-cloud deployments, the network function is interoperable and accessible regardless of network size or ecosystem of core network functions in use. This is particularly useful for service providers seeking a company-wide analytics strategy, who can implement the offering to reach beyond pre-defined 3GPP use cases and work with broader analytics solutions.""Communications service providers are challenged by the levels of complexity that new technology brings to light. Building a competitive advantage requires not only effective operations management, but advanced insight concerning network behavior,"" said Karl Whitelock, research vice president, Communications Service Provider Operations and Monetization, IDC. ""To access enterprise-driven business opportunities, and to create value within new industries goes well beyond traditional connectivity services. Network level analytics must play a heavy role in addressing customer-defined solution needs.""To learn more about Oracle Communications suite of industry leading solutions, join us at booth G24 at Network X, October 18-20, 2022 in Amsterdam.

266,b34dc239-8918-346c-9d49-a2f3c9535fc2,ORCL,2022-10-05,A Timeline of Elon Musk’s Takeover of Twitter: The Deal Is On,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/timeline-elon-musk-became-twitter-205930962.html,1664916828,STORY,['TSLA'],"[(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is now the owner of Twitter Inc., capping months of speculation over whether he would complete the deal. It’s been a wild ride for all involved, but after several fits and starts, the company is finally in the hands of the tech billionaire who also runs Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Here’s the timeline of how it came together.Most Read from BloombergTwitter Now Asks Some Fired Workers to Please Come BackPutin’s Ukraine War Is Entering a Terrifying New PhaseUkraine Latest: US and Russia Discussed Containing War, WSJ SaysLawyer Suing Twitter Over Layoffs Says Musk Trying to ComplyHouston Mogul’s $75 Million Win on Astros Hits Caesars HardestJan. 31: Musk starts building his stakeThe year begins with Musk quietly acquiring Twitter shares. By March 14, he accumulates over a 5% stake, the point at which he’s supposed to disclose the activity to the Securities and Exchange Commission — a misstep that later would trigger a shareholder lawsuit.March 24: Musk starts criticizing Twitter, on TwitterIn late March, with his stake still secret, Musk begins lobbing criticism at the company: “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he tweets on March 24. “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?” he asks on March 25. “Is a new platform needed?” Musk says on March 26. “Am giving serious thought to this.”April 4: Musk’s stake becomes public, and he’s invited to join Twitter’s boardIt becomes known that Musk is Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with more than 9% of the company. His filing lists him as a passive investor, but he’s been actively tweeting about changes to the business. That includes polling users on whether they want an edit button, which would allow people to change tweets after they’ve been published. By end of day, Twitter invites Musk to join the board contingent on him not owning more than 14.9% of the company’s stock.Story continuesApril 5: Musk becomes an active investorIn the morning, several of Twitter’s board members take to the platform to congratulate Musk on his decision to join their ranks. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal tweets that the company and Musk have been chatting for weeks. Later that day, Musk refiles his disclosure to classify himself as an active investor, after indicating that he would accept a seat on the social network’s board.April 9: Musk rejects the board seatMusk rejects the offer to join the board, and Twitter holds the news for roughly 36 hours while waiting to see if he will change his mind. He spends the weekend tweeting more suggestions for the business, like converting Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter “since no one shows up anyway” and charging for user verification, a service that has been free and reserved for notable figures.April 10: Twitter announces Musk is not joining the boardOn Sunday, Agrawal sends a note to employees about Musk not joining the board and later tweets it publicly. Neither Agrawal or Musk give a reason for the reversal.April 11: Speculation aboundsMusk files an amended disclosure with the SEC. He can now purchase as many shares as he wants. Without a board seat, he doesn’t have to act in the best interest of Twitter shareholders. Within the company, which doesn’t have a founder with majority control like other tech giants, employees are “super stressed” and concerned that this is only the beginning of the turmoil.April 14: Musk offers to buy the whole companyIn an SEC filing and accompanying tweet, Musk says he would buy out stockholders in a cash deal then valued at $43 billion to take Twitter private. The offer is $54.20 a share, a 54% premium over the price when he started building his stake in January. Morgan Stanley is brought in to advise on the bid, which Musk describes as his “best and final” offer.April 15: Twitter adopts ‘poison pill’ to ward off Musk takeoverTo thwart Musk, Twitter launches a so-called poison pill, which is a rights plan that allows shareholders to purchase shares at a discount if any shareholder exceeds 15% ownership. It’s a tactic that would effectively dilute the billionaire’s stake. The company says that the intention of the plan is to ensure that anyone taking control through open-market accumulation will pay all shareholders an appropriate premium. Twitter begins to field interest from other parties, and is advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, among others. Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, a friend of Musk, acknowledges in a tweet that as a public company Twitter has always been for sale.April 16: ‘Twitter’s board owns almost no shares’In a flurry of tweets about the potential deal, Musk says, “With Jack departing, the Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares,” so its economic interests are not aligned with shareholders. Dorsey replies, “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company.” Dorsey is scheduled to leave the board once his term expires at the next shareholder meeting on May 25.April 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in fundingMusk says he’s secured $46.5 billion in funding. A filing with the SEC shows that he has $25.5 billion in debt financing from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, including margin loans backed by his equity stake in Tesla and $21 billion in equity financing from himself. But whether the billionaire will sell part of his stake in one of his prized companies to acquire Twitter remains to be seen.April 25: Twitter agrees to be boughtTwitter yields to Musk’s original offer of $54.20 a share. The transaction, valued at about $44 billion, will take the company private. Musk says he will prioritize free speech on the site, make its algorithms open-source, eliminate spam and add new features. Twitter says it expects the deal to close this year.April 29: Musk sells Tesla stockMusk discloses an additional $4.5 billion worth of Tesla stock sales in new regulatory filings, followed by disclosures of 4.4 million shares sold the two prior days, bringing the total to around $8.5 billion that he’s disposed of in the process of buying Twitter. Musk has now sold about $25 billion worth of stock in the electric-car maker during the last six months.May 4: Billionaire backers pony up additional fundsMusk raises an additional $7.1 billion to fund the transaction. Backers include Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, who puts up $1 billion. The bid also gets $800 million from Sequoia Capital, $700 million from Vy Capital and $500 million from Binance, with more than a dozen others contributing as well, according to company filings. Musk secures a pledge from Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who agrees to roll over his nearly 35 million Twitter shares, worth about $1.9 billion at $54.20 per share.May 6: Plans for Twitter revealedIn a pitch deck presented to investors and seen by the New York Times, Musk lays out aggressive growth plans for Twitter, including aiming to quintuple revenue $26.4 billion by 2028, from $5 billion last year, and increasing users to 931 million from 217 million. To accomplish this, he plans to expand the company’s negligible payments business currently used for tipping creators, and increase it to $15 million in revenue by 2023 and $1.3 billion by 2028. The deck also reveals plans to cut the company’s reliance on advertising to less than 50% of revenue, further develop a subscription product and prepare for fluctuating headcount.May 10: Trump ban to be liftedMusk confirms that he would reverse Twitter’s ban on former US president Donald Trump once he’s the owner.“I would reverse the permanent ban,” he says at a Financial Times conference. “Perma bans just fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter as a town square where everyone can voice their opinion.”“My opinion, and Jack Dorsey I want to be clear shares this opinion, is that we should not have permanent bans,” Musk says. Dorsey tweets his agreement, and both men add caveats that illegal behavior or spam wouldn’t be allowed.May 12: Hiring freeze goes into effect and key executives departCEO Agrawal announces a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts amid the state of uncertainty over the acquisition. Two of Twitter’s top leaders also depart: Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue product. Beykpour tweets, “Interrupting my paternity leave to share some final @twitter-related news: I’m leaving the company after over 7 years.” He adds: “The truth is this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision. Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.”According to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, the company is halting hiring and may rescind outstanding offers. The company is also pulling back on costs such as travel, consulting and marketing. Agrawal says global events, including the war in Ukraine and supply-chain crunch, have hurt Twitter’s business, but broad job cuts aren’t yet planned.May 13: Musk hits the brakesWith bots surfacing as a deal breaker, Musk tweets, “Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.” This sends Twitter’s stock plummeting. A few hours later he tweets that he is “still committed” to the acquisition and is waiting on confirmation that fake accounts on the social-media platform contributes to less than 5% of its users.May 16: Musk and Agrawal have it out...on TwitterIn a tweetstorm, Agrawal explains that measuring spam accounts is complicated because some are actually real humans even if they look like spam, and vice versa. Twitter also allows bots on the service, so simply setting up an automated account is not against the rules. Musk is not impressed with Agrawal’s response and suggests calling users to verify their accounts. He then replies to Agrawal with a poop emoji.May 17: Musk threatens to pull outMusk declares that he won’t proceed with his takeover plan unless the social-media giant can prove bots make up fewer than 5% of its users. The comment stokes speculation that Musk may be trying to lower the price. But Twitter’s board says it plans to enforce the $44 billion agreement, and that directors have already voted to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve Musk’s $54.20-a-share offer.If the deal falls apart due to financing issues, Musk would have to pay a $1 billion breakup fee, but he can’t walk away for just any reason. The merger agreement includes a specific performance provision that allows Twitter to force Musk to consummate the takeover, according to a securities filing. That could mean that, should the deal end up in court, Twitter might secure an order obligating Musk to complete the merger rather than winning monetary compensation for any violations of it.July 8: Musk backs out of deal, citing ‘spam bots’Musk backs out of the deal to buy the platform, saying in a regulatory filing that the company has made “misleading representations” over the number of so-called spam bots on the service. He also says in a letter to Twitter that the company hasn’t “complied with its contractual obligations” to provide information about how to assess how prevalent the bots are on the social-media service and argues that Twitter has failed to operate its normal course of business.July 12: Twitter sues MuskTwitter files suit in Delaware Chancery Court to compel Musk to complete the deal. In the lawsuit, Twitter says, “Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” Musk then countersues Twitter, arguing the company misled investors and the SEC and was “frantically closing the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud,” according to the filing reviewed by Bloomberg.Sept. 29: Private texts revealedAs part of the lawsuit slated to go to trial on Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court, Musk’s private text messages become public, revealing how the deal came together, including early conversations with Dorsey.There are also a flurry of messages from industry insiders who offer suggestions on who should be CEO. Investor Bill Lee suggests Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital. Steve Jurvetson pushes for the former chief business officer of Uber Technologies Inc., Emil Michael. And investor Jason Calacanis texts, “Put me in the game coach! Twitter CEO is my dream job.”Oct. 4: Musk revives $44 billion takeover bidTo avoid a courtroom fight, Elon Musk revives his bid for Twitter at the original offer price of $54.20 a share. Twitter shares climb as much as 23% after resuming trading following a halt on the news.Oct. 6: It’s do or dieDelaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick agrees to pause the court case to give the two parties a chance to complete the deal. A hard deadline is set for agreement to be reached by Oct. 28 at 5 p.m., or a trial will resume in November.Oct. 27: Musk buys TwitterWith the court deadline approaching, Musk finalizes the deal and takes possession of Twitter.His first act is to fire the executive leadership that thwarted him, including CEO Agrawal.As he tweets plans for unbanning accounts and charging for user verification, there are murmurings of another wave of Twitter quitters. General Motors Co. pauses ads. Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes tweets, “Not hanging around for whatever Elon has planned. Bye.”The deal is done, ending Twitter’s nine-year run as a public company. But with Musk poised to cut jobs and shake up the company’s business model, the upheaval may just be beginning.(Updates with closing of deal.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEl Salvador’s $300 Million Bitcoin ‘Revolution’ Is Failing MiserablyUS Housing Hit by Spiraling Mortgage Rates as Inflation PersistsYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFast Fashion Waste Is Choking Developing Countries With Mountains of TrashThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid Mystery©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Long-Term Stock Portfolio: 5 Tech Stocks to Consider.Growth stocks are lagging in 2022 amid skyrocketing inflation and incessant rate hikes. As of September 30, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has lost 33% of its value year-to-date. Growth stocks have been beaten down to levels where they are presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors.Analyst Says: “Try To Get Great Names On Pullbacks”Senior securities analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, Barton Crocket, was interviewed on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, where he discussed how investors can navigate the current market situation around tech stocks by investing in blue chip companies. He also talked about how now is an attractive entry point for long-term investors to own some of the top tech companies. According to Barton Crocket, investors “have to own tech” because “tech is the future”. Here are some comments from the analyst:“What I think we’re looking at is an environment where it’s more treacherous than really any time in many years to own tech. You’ve got valuation risk around higher interest rates, around slowing growth, you’ve got a plethora of new secular challenges…You have a lot of things to consider but you have to own tech right, so tech is the future. The question is how you navigate that, and I think you want to stick with and have some exposure to some of the best names at a reasonable valuation...”Barton Crocket was then asked if long-term investors should take up stakes in tech stocks before earnings season or wait for companies to report earnings. The analyst said that “clearly there’s increasing risk as we worry about the macro into the earnings reports” but “the stocks have reflected a lot of this already”. The analyst said that investors that are trying to time the market amid macro uncertainty can “miss an opportunity” and that they should instead “try to get great names on pullbacks”.Story continuesWhile the near term for tech stocks looks gloomy, they can become the highest returning components of your portfolio in the long term. Some of the top tech stocks to consider buying for the long-term include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction.

We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”8.

This latest version could aid to prevent and curb phone theft in Latin American regions.Communications service providers, committed to combating phone theft and improving customer service, are looking to implement databases to deactivate lost or stolen mobile devices. By disabling devices and keeping them inoperable on mobile networks around the world, operators can protect customers and help reduce criminals' incentive to steal.This product allows operators to include the IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) codes of stolen devices, which are the only ones that correspond to specific terminals, in a blacklist that prevents them from operating on the network. It connects to the GSMA-maintained IMEI database, which is stored in the CEIR and acts as a central system for network operators to share information about stolen devices to prevent them from operating on a network.Story continuesOracle’s Cloud Expansion Strategy- A Game ChangerOracle is striving hard to strengthen its position in the lucrative cloud space. As part of Oracle’s planned expansion of its cloud region footprint to support strong customer demand for OCI and Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications services worldwide, Oracle aims to open additional cloud regions in Colombia, Chile, and Israel, and plans to offer at least 44 cloud regions.In first-quarter 2023, Oracle's total quarterly revenues were up 18% year over year, largely due to a 14% increase in cloud services and license support subscriptions. Total cloud services and license revenues for the quarter hit $8.4 billion — driven by Oracle Fusion Cloud, Oracle Autonomous Database and OCI Gen 2.An expanding clientele is enabling the company to maintain its leading position in the cloud ERP market. The healthy adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) bodes well for the long term.Apart from Oracle, the HCM space is dominated by the likes of Workday WDAY, SAP SE SAP and Automatic Data Processing ADP.SAP’s SuccessFactors Solutions suite is the mainstay of the company’s HCM solutions. Last year, the company added a new cloud-based solution— the SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking — to the SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management solutions portfolio.Workday’s top line is being driven by high demand for its HCM and financial management solutions. Some of the notable HCM deal wins for Workday include Novartis, DraftKings, and CTBC Bank.Automatic Data Processing is one of the leading names in the cloud-based HCM solutions space. The company has expanded its footprint in the HCM market through multiple acquisitions that include Celergo, WorkMarket, and The Marcus Buckingham Company.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

271,fd2b6826-0162-3326-812b-4fc9146999b8,PSA,2022-10-05,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Public Storage (PSA),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164504861.html,1664901904,STORY,"['PSA', 'PSA-PM']","[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Public Storage (PSA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this self-storage facility real estate investment trust a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Public Storage is 6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 21.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.8%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Public Storage has an S/TA ratio of 0.22, which means that the company gets $0.22 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.12, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Public Storage looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 21.2% this year versus the industry average of 10%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Public Storage. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.Bottom LinePublic Storage has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Public Storage is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Equinix is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market with an average daily volume of just 425,000 shares.The daily price chart looks like this:Both the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average are headed down and price is well below the two. This is a bearish look, for sure. Also, the September lows took out the June and July lows — breaking previous support like this is bad news.

The price chart looks better than the above two because it’s managed to stay above the mid-June lows.

Now the Wall Street Journal reporting that some of Apple's suppliers are adding manufacturing operations in the United States, especially focusing on California. And chipmaker Micron is set to invest $100 billion in Central New York State for a semiconductor factory in Syracuse.Joining us now, we want to bring in Jay Timmons. He's the National Association of Manufacturers CEO and president. Jay, it's great to see you. So obviously, jobs coming and many of them, tens of thousands of jobs coming, in the manufacturing sector. The JOLTS report out this morning, showing 795,000 manufacturing job openings in the month of August. From your conversations that you're having, from leads within this sector, I guess, what's your assessment just on the state of manufacturing right now and the dire need to hire?JAY TIMMONS: Well, it's good to see you as well. And I have to tell you, manufacturing is running very strong right now. As you said, 800,000 approximately jobs are open in the sector. That's on top, though, of about 30,000 jobs we've been filling every single month for the last year. So as you can see, we still have-- we have a lot of room to go to bring people on.We're keeping our promises that we made in 2017, when those tax cuts were put into place, to invest in America, to hire workers in America, and to raise wages and benefits. That legislation, plus the Chips and Science Act, are really supercharging manufacturing in America.SEANA SMITH: Jay, what does this do to cost? Because I think that's a big question for consumers out there. Is it going to substantially bring down costs, the fact that we're focusing on manufacturing here in the US?Story continuesJAY TIMMONS: Well, I think that's a piece of it. Look, there are so many things that go into inflationary pressures-- monetary policy, fiscal policy, the massive amount of debt that was signed into law in the last administration, and then at the beginning of this administration, to deal with the pandemic because we didn't know what else to do. So those things have all gone into increasing a lot of money in the system and a lot of demand by consumers when manufacturers can't keep up with supply. And one of the reasons we can't do that is because the jobs that we do need to fill.Having said that, you're right. When we do things here in this country, when we make things here in this country, that can reduce the cost of doing business, and therefore, the cost of those goods to consumers, as long as we don't impose additional costs. And by that, I mean, undue regulatory burden costs or additional tax costs. So we've got to keep that all balanced. And it's a constant balancing act that business and the government has to be focused on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we're certainly think Micron investing in that future with pledging up to $100 billion for the semiconductor factory in New York. But as we mentioned there, you still have all these job openings. But obviously this is coming as a result of the chip sector wanting to get more of these jobs here. What do you think of the momentum that we've seen since the CHIPS Act and what this means for the pipeline of, perhaps, training and jobs that are still needed to fill some of these skills gaps?JAY TIMMONS: So I just think it's so exciting to see the results of-- I want to call it post-partisan. A lot of people call it bipartisan. I want to call it post-partisan. We put politics aside to get the Chips and Science Act into place. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that this was a big reason that they're making this massive investment in New York.It's another reason that we saw Intel making their massive investment in Ohio or letting that investment to go forward. I was really pleased to be there for the groundbreaking with President Biden just last month. So I think you're going to see more and more of this happening in this country, which is good news. We don't want to rely on Asia.We don't want to rely on either hostile or potentially hostile foreign regimes to supply critical inputs to manufactured products, or energy, for that matter. That's another cost input. And you're right. This will also-- the Chips and Science Act will also provide some training dollars that are so necessary to upskill and futureproof the jobs of manufacturing for manufacturing workers.SEANA SMITH: Jay, supply chain issues, rising costs, two of the big challenges facing manufacturers today. Any improvement there? And I guess, when do you expect to see substantial improvement?JAY TIMMONS: Yeah, I look at the supply chain challenge like a frozen pipe in the winter. When is it going to thaw? And what we are seeing-- and I will say this anecdotally because it's through those conversations that I have with many of the CEOs who are members of my board of directors at the National Association of Manufacturers. They're starting to see a slight thaw in the supply chain bottleneck. And I think that's good news for us.These types of investments that you see, again, for chip fabrication facilities here in this country will also help that supply chain crisis ease, but of course, that's many years in the future. So we're going to see incremental progress. And we'll start to see the supply chain ease, that will help with inflation. That will also help, I think, with, obviously, the shortage of certain products around the country.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously, Jay, manufacturing isn't a monolith. We're seeing sort of different areas recovering at different paces. Of the millions of men and women who are part of the Manufacturers' Association, what are some of the best performing sectors? And what are some of the ones that could really still use some help or that are going through a bit of difficulty?JAY TIMMONS: Well, look, I think to be very frank about it, I think the entire sector has just done amazingly well, given some pretty difficult conditions. So I put inflation in that bucket. I put our workforce shortage in that bucket. And then of course, I put the supply chain crisis in that bucket. They all kind of feed each other. So when you can't get the input supplies you need, you can't supply the demand that's out there. That increases price pressures. You also don't have enough people doing the job if you do get those products supplied to be able to build the final product.So I think all sectors have done phenomenally well. One that I think we all probably are watching very carefully, given the global situation, is the food and beverage manufacturing sector. Russia has destabilized, or they're attempting to destabilize, the entire world to get the world to bend to the will of the Communist regime under Vladimir Putin. And the world has to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for the war crimes that he's committed in Ukraine.But those war crimes, I think, are even broader than that. They're causing disruptions to the food chain and the food supply. And I hope-- as well as energy, of course, in Europe, which has an impact all around the world. So I hope that we're going to see the rest of the world holding Russia accountable for what they're doing to destabilize economies globally.SEANA SMITH: Well, Jay, mentioning that geopolitical risk factor there, there was a KPMG survey out saying 91% of CEOs predict a recession in the next 12 months, talking about some of that uncertainty. 66% saying that it's not going to be mild, and it's not going to be short. That's pretty alarming. What are you hearing from your CEOs?JAY TIMMONS: So we did a study-- pardon me-- a survey of our members, as we do every quarter. 2/3 also believe that we're probably headed for a recession next year. But I'm not sure that anybody really knows what that recession is going to look like. And I think one of the reasons for that is, I don't think any of us would have predicted kind of how the economy would have responded over the course of the last few years, given all of the factors that are out there, whether it's inflation or interest rates or unemployment.All of these things are a little bit out of balance for those of us who have been around a long time, like I have. You look back to the 1970s, and you saw the triple whammy of high unemployment, high inflation, high interest rates. We haven't had that unemployment component, although it does look like, based on this last JOLTS report, that the economy is cooling a tad.The question is, can we land this plane gently? Or is it going to be a bumpy landing? And I think, obviously, the Fed wants to have it be a gentle landing. Obviously, the business community wants it to be a gentle landing. And I think every American wants it to be a gentle landing. So perhaps we are headed toward that. And let's just all hope so.SEANA SMITH: We certainly do hope so. Jay Timmons, thanks so much for taking the time to join us once again. Great to see you.]"

Moreover, the company promised to increase operating profits by a whopping 50% over the next three years — mostly through cost cuts and new product introductions. All of that hype by management comes despite rising economic pressures causing a contraction in U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2022.The mounting financial pressure on consumers and volatile currency markets caused Hasbro to slash its full year sales guidance at the event and bank on a big holiday quarter to meet its lowered financial goals.Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks at the company's investor day on Tuesday.

Hasbro warning of a weaker third quarter revenue outlook, cutting its full year revenue forecast at its investor day today, but projecting sales to be flat to slightly down for 2022.For the long-term, though, a bit of a different tune. Management remaining positive as CEO Chris Cocks announced Blueprint 2.0, laying out a growth plan that includes a larger emphasis on gaming and licensing shares-- on gaming and licensing, excuse me.Shares fell as much as 6% in earlier trading, although you can see it now back in positive territory, up just around 1%. Dave, it will be interesting to see where this company goes. Obviously, the next couple of months will likely be a bit of a struggle for them as consumers pull back, but they're pretty positive, looking further ahead.DAVE BRIGGS: Licensing including Wakanda Forever, which we expect to be a major hit, and they expect to see some significant sales off of. But also, part of that plan was $250 to $300 million in cost cutting without really identifying where those cuts are coming from and not mentioning any layoffs in that release either, although transferring a lot of employees to more hybrid work. But that ain't going to get you anywhere near 250 to 300 million, so it'll be interesting to see where that comes from. And Wordle, their board game, coming out. I don't know. Will you play?SEANA SMITH: I love Wordle. I don't have--DAVE BRIGGS: You play every day?SEANA SMITH: I don't play every day. I used to play every day. I actually kind of forgot about it. So thank you for reminding me. I really like it. But I think that could be a huge hit for them.DAVE BRIGGS: ""Dungeons and Dragons"" still a big hit for them.]"

Morgan have noted investor concerns about retailers potentially reducing the inventory of the toymaker's products heading into the all-important holiday season as consumers increasingly cut discretionary purchases.Walmart Inc and Target Corp, which have both spelled out plans to drastically reduce inventory levels in recent weeks, together account for over a third of Hasbro's sales, according to UBS.The Monopoly maker lowered its annual revenue forecast to between flat and slightly down on a constant currency basis from its prior expectation of a low single-digit revenue growth.Hasbro said it expects third-quarter revenue to decline approximately 15% on a reported basis and 12% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.Still, the company aims to increase profit by 50% over the next three years, with plans to expand margins to 20% by 2027 as they focus on selling more toys and games such as Peppa Pig and Nerf Guns directly to consumers and via online channels. Hasbro reported an operating margin of 16.4% in the third quarter.The largest U.S. toymaker also forecast it will report annual revenue of $8.5 billion or greater by 2027.Shares of Hasbro rose marginally in morning trading.(Reporting by Mehr Bedi in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 3.06%. At the same time, the Dow added 2.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.16%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the industrial real estate developer had lost 14.38% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's loss of 5.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 6.15% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Prologis as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 19, 2022. On that day, Prologis is projected to report earnings of $1.76 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 69.23%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.13 billion, up 8.86% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.17 per share and revenue of $4.46 billion, which would represent changes of +24.58% and +7.58%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Prologis should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Prologis is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Prologis is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.18.

Rowe Price Group, Inc.’s TROW diversified business model, solid assets under management (AUM) balance and strong liquidity position keep supporting its financials amid a tough operating backdrop. Rising costs and increased dependence on investment advisory fees are woes.Revenue growth remains a key strength at T. Rowe Price, with net revenues seeing a five-year (ended 2021) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.1%. It witnessed a decline in the metric in the first half of 2022 due to the impact of declining markets on the AUM balance. Nonetheless, the company remains focused on fortifying its business by enhancing investment capabilities, broadening its distribution reach and deepening client partnerships to support long-term growth.In the upcoming quarters, the mix shift toward international growth funds is expected to help increase revenues and investment management margin of the company. For the five years ended Jun 30, 2022, 66% of the T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds AUM outperformed the Morningstar median, while 60% outperformed the passive peer median.TROW’s debt-free position with substantial liquidity has aided in impressive capital deployment activities. It has hiked quarterly dividends every year since its IPO in 1986, the most recent being a sequential hike of 11.1% in February 2022 to $1.20 per share. This was T. Rowe Price’s 36th consecutive annual dividend increase.Also, the company has a common share repurchase program, through which 3.8 million shares were bought back by the firm for $519.6 million in the first half of 2022. Such efforts reflect the company’s commitment to return value to its shareholders with its strong cash generation capabilities.However, elevated operating expenses are major concerns for T. Rowe Price, with costs escalating witnessing a four-year (2018-2021) CAGR of 9.6%. It saw a downtrend in the first half of 2022. However, the company incurs significant expenditure to attract investment advisory clients and additional investments from existing clients. This might inflate expenses in the near term and hinder its bottom-line expansion.Story continuesInvestment advisory fees are the biggest source of revenues for T. Rowe Price and the dependence on the fees could affect the company's financials in the near term, as the changes in AUM, owing to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations, regulatory changes or a sudden slowdown in overall business activities, could hurt this revenue source.Also, the company expects to continue seeing net outflows amid an unfavorable equity environment, high overall market volatility and challenged investment performance across flagship growth strategies.Lastly, the majority of the assets under T. Rowe Price's purview are invested in U.S. equities. This product category has been most susceptible to market-share losses due to the heightened adoption of passive investments via index funds and exchange-traded funds.Other asset managers seeing a similar rise in expenses are Franklin Resources, Inc. BEN and Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. APAM.Artisan Partners’ operating expenses have been exhibiting an uptrend for the past few years. It witnessed a four-year CAGR of 9.5% in 2021. The rise was primarily attributable to increased incentive compensation and third-party distribution expenses. APAM continued to see an increasing trend in the first half of 2022.Franklin’sexpenses witnessed a CAGR of 16.2% over the last four years (ended fiscal 2021). Although The company has achieved 100% run-rate cost synergies of $300 million from the Legg Mason acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the metric remained flat in the first nine months of fiscal 2022.

301,ded03a9d-4cd5-3d95-9a3f-cf6f74511d63,AXP,2022-10-05,American Express Travel Is Right on Point for Certain Millennial Travelers,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-travel-point-certain-063000131.html,1664951400,STORY,"['AXP', 'GBTG']","[Audrey Hendley, president of American Express Travel, making a point on stage during a sponsored session at Skift Global Forum in New York City on Sept. 20, 2022. Neil van Niekerk / SkiftA majority of American Express’ new customers — 60 percent — in the second quarter belonged to the Generation Z and millennial generations, a metric very much noticed at subsidiary American Express Travel.“Their mindset around culturally impactful travel is helping to shape what we do,” Audrey Hendley, president of American Express Travel, told Skift last week.American Express Travel, the leisure travel business that handles cardmembers’ vacations and pleasure trips, became the sixth largest U.S. travel agency in 2021, overtaking Flight Centre and Internova.That ranking is from Travel Weekly’s 2022 Power List, which pegged American Express Travel at $4.9 billion in 2021 sales. This figure was just 71 percent of the travel agency’s 2019 numbers, but parent company American Express reported that in April cardmembers’ total travel and entertainment spending, including for hotels, flights, car rentals and cruises, as well as restaurants and concerts, rose to 108 percent of the 2019 mark. That was the first time travel and entertainment spending through American Express eclipsed pre-pandemic levels.“We have seen the demand for travel rebound faster and stronger than what we expected,” Hendley said.One signal of that rebound is the recovery of the company’s elongated booking windows, which many travel companies saw shrink to a fraction of their pre-pandemic lengths as uncertainty and disruption took their toll.“We’re seeing advanced bookings being very, very strong,” Hendley said. “So one of the measures that I look at is 120-plus days out from today. Versus the same time in 2019, those 120-day-plus bookings are up 40 percent for U.S. card members.”The trip mix has reverted to pre-pandemic levels of 70 percent domestic and 30 percent international, she said, adding, “And that’s kind of back to what we would’ve seen in the past, as travel continues to surge.”American Express Travel and Amex Global Business TravelMany people confuse American Express Travel, the leisure travel agency that’s part of public credit card company American Express, with the larger American Express Global Business Travel ($7.1 billion in 2021 sales), which became a public company in its own right in at the end of May.Story continuesThe two businesses had been part of the same parent company until 2014 when American Express spun out Amex Global Business Travel into a privately held joint venture.The two companies have a tight relationship, and American Express owns 35 percent of Amex Global Business Travel, now formally known as Global Business Travel Group. That stake is down from 40 percent before the business travel company’s stock market debut.Among the tie-ins, American Express licenses its brand to the business travel group, and American Express and the Global Business Travel Group conduct joint negotiations with airlines, hotels and car rental companies to wrangle sometimes-exclusive deals, including private airfares, as well as significant discounts and perks such as late checkouts or hotel upgrades.The Value PropositionThose deals are part of the reason many cardmembers are attracted to American Express Travel, which touts its roughly 100 years in the travel industry, despite some weaknesses (we’ll discuss further below).American Express Platinum cardmembers, according to American Express Travel, “can enjoy exclusive savings on premium class fares on over 20 participating airlines” when booking international trips at AmexTravel.com.Business Platinum cardmembers who book first and business class seats partially or wholly with points through American Express Travel receive 35 percent of these points back, the company said.Luxury lodging benefits from 2,000 hotels around the world include 5x membership rewards points for Platinum cardmembers when they book on AmexTravel.com, and they can pay for these stays with points on that portal, as well.“I book all my travel with Amex,” said Marcus Baldwin, 27, who’s in the tech industry, in a Twitter direct message. “I think the hotel prices are compelling and I like the added perks I get from the hotels program (including Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection). “I also think the peace of mind of dealing with a travel company that knows me based on my card membership. I like being able to use points to pay with travel also.”Baldwin’s one cited disappointment is he would like to see American Express Travel add the ability to book Amtrak tickets.Allen Walton, 34, the founder of FlyGuyTravel and a Richardson, Texas resident, said in a phone call that he booked around half a dozen hotel stays through American Express Travel over the last year, including an upcoming reservation at a Hilton’s Conrad Bangkok in Thailand, and he’s generally found the rates “way better” than booking directly with the hotel or Booking.com, or even compared to group rates in one instance when he was attending an event.Travel Agents and Mix of Booking ChannelsAmerican Express Travel has around 7,000 travel agents, or travel consultants in company parlance, in 23 countries, and the planning and booking experience can be hybrid.Hendley of American Express Travel said the agency attempts to provide a cross-channel experience so disclosing to this reporter a percentage of online or offline bookings might be misleading, and a “disservice” to each.“So you could go online, and you could start your booking there and then you have something a little bit more complicated or something you want to talk about,” Hendley said. “And you might then say, forget that. I’m going to call you on the phone. You might start on the phone and you might say, you know what? I need to look around and see what other hotels are in the location, and you go back to the online.”Walton, the Texas entrepreneur, said he booked a stay using the American Express Platinum card’s concierge service, but reserved the wrong dates. In trying to modify the booking, he said the customer service was “not great” because the concierge service agent told him she couldn’t cancel an American Express Travel booking, and redirected Walton back to the travel agency’s non-Platinum cardmember customer service.On the other hand, Danielle Nuzzo, 38, a communications professional at Trust &amp; Will in San Diego, California, raved in a Twitter direct message about her experience booking her honeymoon, including using Amex points for the flights, through American Express Travel six years ago.“They had a lot of knowledge of specific hotels and villas to book in Sri Lanka and the Maldives,” Nuzzo said. “They were super helpful on which hotel and even the villa number to book in the Maldives for the best sunset view.”Nuzzo’s American Express travel consultant even came to the rescue with a visa on short notice.“Well one thing that was overlooked was a tourist visa, which was needed for Sri Lanka,” Nuzzo said. “So the day before our flight, while in Dubai, we realized we don’t have a visa but once we contacted our agent she was able to get it sorted out very quickly and we were on the flight the next day. “Nuzzo said the couple communicated with the American Express Travel agent for the honeymoon trip “mostly by phone and email communication.”“I’m wondering if they have an app now that you could direct-message your agent for quicker responses?,” asked Nuzzo, who counts herself solidly as a millennial.If there are some gripes at times about American Express Travel’s customer service, it should be pointed out that American Express took top honors for customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study for the third year in a row.There Are Millennials and Then There Are Other MillennialsNuzzo’s reference to whether American Express Travel has a mobile app raises the issue of how American Express Travel relates to younger travelers.American Express Travel doesn’t have a dedicated mobile app, and when cardmembers seek to book travel in the American Express app they get pushed to an American Express Travel mobile website.American Express Travel’s Hendley said the company’s customers — and not just the ones who skew younger — seek experiential travel — and during the second quarter 60 percent of American Express’ new customers in the U.S. were Generation Z or millennials.Hendley said American Express Travel found that 81 percent of its customers expressed the sentiment that it was “very important” that they feel like they are contributing to local economies when they travel.“And this is very meaningful to people, and it’s not just what you would think in terms of millennials,” she said. “It’s across the board in terms of what customers want. They want to be in local places, they don’t want the one size fits all.”American Express Travel doesn’t have a great mobile experience, and it doesn’t offer short-term rentals during an era where many people are looking to travel, work, and live in new places beyond hotels. Hendley pointed out that its Fine Hotels + Resorts program offers “a lot of properties that have onsite villas, and properties that have multiple bedrooms and kitchens in different destinations.”If American Express Travel indeed wants to appeal to customers in the current era, after the pandemic reshaped the travel environment, doesn’t it need to offer more vacation rentals at a minimum?Calling it “an interesting trend,” Hendley said the company knows a lot of customers are interested in short-term rentals.“We’re watching the ways people are traveling, and I just want to make sure that if we ever did that, that we made sure that we were innovating and being very differentiated in the marketplace,” Hendley said.It would be easy to envision an American Express Travel partnership with Homes &amp; Villas by Marriott International, which deals in higher-end vacation rentals, or Amex could find another collaborator. American Express currently offers co-branded credit cards with Marriott, Hilton, and Delta Air Lines.Jordan Stolper, 44, an entrepreneur who lives in Denver, Colorado, uses his Amex Platinum Card for travel and American Express Travel solely for the cardmember benefits, including 5x points and perks like free breakfasts.In terms of appealing to younger travelers, Stolper said in a phone interview that American Express Travel has “no decent mobile experience,” which would be a short-coming for travelers who live with their phones at the ready 24/7. But he cautioned that short-term rentals aren’t necessarily a make-or-break feature.Millennials and Generation Z are “not a market segment — it’s an age range,” Stolper said. “Not all millennials shop and think alike. Not all millennials want to stay in Airbnbs.”So Gen Z and millennial travelers booking business class seats on Delta through American Express or using their Amex Platinum cards to earn 5x rewards are not necessarily the same ones scrolling for deals or watering plants to earn rewards in the Hopper app, or scouring comparison shopping websites like Google Travel or Skyscanner to find hotel bargains.Who Powers WhatStolper, who co-founded a travel startup more than a decade ago, disparaged the look and feel of American Express Travel, and characterized it as “an overlay on Expedia.”Indeed, Expedia provides the backend foundation for American Express Travel’s air, hotel, car and tour verticals while Arrivia does cruise.American Express Travel, in tandem with Amex Global Business Travel, negotiates the deals in its airline and hotel programs. And American Express tweaks the front end user experience beyond what its booking engine partners provide.More Banks Launching Travel PortalsA flurry of financial institutions, including Capital One with Hopper; Chase, with the acquisition of Frosch, and Citi with Booking.com, are newly operating, revamping or launching travel businesses.Is this a challenge to American Express Travel?Hendley characterized banks getting into travel as a positive trend. “It kind of buoys us and gives us confidence in what we are doing,” she said, and referenced more than 2,000 properties in Fine Hotels + Resorts, its global network of airlines and cruise partners, tours and land-based vacations, as well as 1,400 lounges in some 140 countries.“For us, we feel like we’ve got a very strong value proposition, and we’ve got a strong infrastructure,” Hendley said. “We continue to invest and we continue to get to know our customers with every trip, and iterate and develop from there.”Several Additional PointsWhen it comes to points redemption, an article in The Points Guy last year argued that there can be more value in transferring Amex rewards points to airline and hotel loyalty programs than redeeming them on AmexTravel.com.“While you can use your points to book hotels and flights in the Amex Travel Portal, you’ll typically get more value from your American Express Membership Rewards points by transferring them to airline and hotel partners instead,” the article said. “There are exceptions to this, such as the case of last-minute travel when there is no award availability available.”Hendley said she wasn’t familiar with the article, adding “it’s very hard to say yes or no to that.”The American Express Travel president didn’t directly answer the points redemption question, and focused instead on what her travel agency offers in service.When you find out from your airline that it changed your flight, and your American Express Travel team took care of everything, “so I don’t know, is that more points or less points than what you would have received if you went to the airline directly,” Hendley said.“In this case, I would probably venture you’re getting better value in American Express because their [the airline’s] value proposition is around the fares,” and American Express Travel is providing so much more, she said. “So that’s why it’s hard to do a straight line comparison.”There’s another part of American Express Travel’s infrastructure that Hendley frequently mentions — the company’s 7,000 travel consultants.With plenty of holiday travel looming, Hendley said the travel industry has made huge commitments to decreasing the disruption that made summer travel so difficult for many.“We say this to customers all the time: You always have to have plan B,” Hendley said. “What happens if … and that’s of course where your traveling comes in. Your travel consultant is there to help you with the plan B because things don’t go to plan. So let’s have a plan when it doesn’t go to plan.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

(NASDAQ:NTAP) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-66-56-netapp-inc-101000101.html,1664964600,STORY,['NTAP'],"[Let's talk about the popular NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$78.56 and falling to the lows of US$61.85. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NetApp's current trading price of US$66.56 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NetApp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for NetApp Is NetApp Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 15.25x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 16.66x, which means if you buy NetApp today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that NetApp should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NetApp’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from NetApp?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NetApp's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NTAP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at NTAP? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NTAP, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NTAP, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing NetApp at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NetApp you should know about.If you are no longer interested in NetApp, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Fredric Reynolds, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$57.53. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, Mondelez International insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.1% of Mondelez International shares, worth about US$94m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Mondelez International Insiders?The fact that there have been no Mondelez International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at Mondelez International in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Mondelez International and we suggest you have a look.But note: Mondelez International may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.3bUS$7.56bUS$3.25bUS$3.12bUS$3.06bUS$3.03bUS$3.03bUS$3.05bUS$3.08bUS$3.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -2.05%Est @ -0.85%Est @ -0.01%Est @ 0.57%Est @ 0.98%Est @ 1.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$10.5kUS$6.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (8.0%– 1.9%) = US$52bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$52b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$24bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$56b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$66.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.430. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Occidental Petroleum, we've compiled three important items you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - Occidental Petroleum has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does OXY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This oil and gas exploration and production company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.73%.For the most recent quarter, Occidental was expected to post earnings of $2.93 per share, but it reported $3.16 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.97 per share, while it actually produced $2.12 per share, a surprise of 7.61%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Occidental, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Occidental currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.19%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -6.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Vertex falls in, has lost 2.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Vertex is expected to post earnings of $3.68 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.21 points to a change of +9.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.09 indicates a change of +6.2% from what Vertex is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Vertex is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VRTX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Vertex, the consensus sales estimate of $2.22 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $8.77 billion and $9.31 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.8% and +6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVertex reported revenues of $2.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.5%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.02%. The EPS surprise was +3.45%.Over the last four quarters, Vertex surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Vertex is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Vertex. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Norfolk Southern in FocusBased in Atlanta, Norfolk Southern (NSC) is in the Transportation sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -27.18%. The railroad is paying out a dividend of $1.24 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.29% compared to the Transportation - Rail industry's yield of 1.37% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.78%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.96 is up 19.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, Norfolk Southern has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.97%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Norfolk Southern's payout ratio is 39%, which means it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NSC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $13.69 per share, with earnings expected to increase 13.05% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates.

322,96d88314-c89e-3c1d-8ca4-15a61ed5bccf,KO,2022-10-05,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 61% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-120036668.html,1664971236,STORY,['KO'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 61% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Coca-Cola already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.3% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Coca-Cola Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.6b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Coca-Cola. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NASDAQ:INTU) insiders disposed of US$22m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-intuit-inc-120100044.html,1664971260,STORY,['INTU'],"[The fact that multiple Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At IntuitIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Laura Fennell, sold US$9.1m worth of shares at a price of US$611 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$412). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Intuit insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Intuit Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Intuit. In total, insider Varun Krishna sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Intuit insiders own 2.8% of the company, worth about US$3.2b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Intuit Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Intuit stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Intuit you should be aware of.Of course Intuit may not be the best stock to buy.

Monterey AL is made up of both solid and porous structures within a single implant, leveraging Stryker’s proprietary Tritanium In-Growth Technology, a material designed to mimic cancellous bone and provide an environment favorable to bone regeneration and fusion.1-4 New data demonstrates that undifferentiated stem cells grown on Tritanium exhibited osteogenic Alkaline Phosphatase without requiring growth factor supplements.5,6This press release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire)""No one understands 3D-printing like Stryker – the fact that they’ve been able to dial in the right mix of small, medium, and large pores in a reproducibly randomized matrix is incredible,"" said Bala Giri, MD, President and Founder, Texas Neuro Spine Institute. ""Their growing body of pre-clinical data, specifically the cellular findings published most recently,5,6 makes my decision to go with these products very straightforward. Our goal with any implant is spinal fusion, and Stryker has taken a very intentional approach to designing the Tritanium cages with this goal in mind.""Monterey AL Interbody System highlights:Tritanium In-Growth Technology: Tritanium is a 3D-printed, novel, highly porous titanium material designed for bone in-growth and biological fixation, built using AMagine, Stryker’s proprietary approach to implant creation using additive manufacturing.1Functionally optimized footprint options: Strategically deeper and narrower cage footprints allow surgeons to create indirect decompression by distracting the disc space posteriorly.2 These geometries are designed to both help prevent the cage from impinging posteriorly into the neural foramen and lessen the need to countersink the cage, thereby allowing for easy access to the anterior screw holes.2Straightforward instruments: The robust medial attachment, multiple technique possibilities, and a wide variety of screwdriver options are designed to facilitate clear visualization of and easy access to the surgical site once the approach is complete and a retractor is in place.2Story continues""This is an exciting time for our division, as we continue to build momentum and expand our portfolio to bring new technology to our surgeon customers,"" said Robbie Robinson, President of the Spine division, Stryker. ""One of our goals as a medical technology company and an implant manufacturer is to complement clear visualization and easy access with intuitive instruments and biologically inspired implant designs.

To skip our detailed analysis of the clean energy sector in 2022, go directly and see 5 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In.The economic activity during and after the pandemic triggered price spikes for multiple commodities. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 added to the inflation crisis, causing drastic increases in energy prices and massive supply-chain disruptions. However, according to the Global Energy Perspective 2022 by McKinsey, the transition to a lower-carbon energy system continues to gain pace, and the incoming years are projected to witness a rapidly changing clean energy landscape. Following the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a grand total of 64 countries have followed the U.S. and have legislated in an effort to accomplish decarbonization goals in the next couple of decades. The Inflation Reduction Act facilitates upcoming decarbonization technologies, including hydrogen and EVs. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted an in-depth analysis into the future of the clean energy sector. It concluded that as the world combats the impending threat of climate change by facilitating the move towards a low-carbon future, companies which choose to compete within these transitional changes have the highest chances of profitability.Hence, it is reasonable to expect clean energy to be the future of the utilities and power sectors. It is for this reason that hedge funds are investing heavily in clean energy stocks, some of the most prominent being NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In this article, we shall look at 14 of the best clean energy stocks to invest in. Photo by Jason Blackeye on Unsplash   Our MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey's database of 895 hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter and picked the top 14 clean energy stocks owned by these elite money managers.Story continuesBest Clean Energy Stocks To Invest In14.

He expressed positive share support near-term on the notion of industry acceptance of green H2, keeping a Buy rating and $32 price target on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares.Global supply of lithium is rapidly running short and since HFC vehicles have similar range when compared to petrol-powered vehicles and are able to refuel just as quickly, the latter will eventually fizzle out.

U.S. buyers imported about 4.3 million barrels of Kazakhstan's CPC Blend, down from 13.2 million in the same period a year ago. Refiners increased purchases of Middle East crude, particularly Basra Medium, as CPC fell.Traders initially this year shunned CPC oil out of fear that loadings from Russia's Novorossiysk port might be barred. They were not, but terminal equipment repairs, oilfield and pipeline maintenances have cut shipments and volumes.Chevron, which owns a 50% stake in Kazakh oil producer Tengizchevroil, PBF Energy's Delaware City refinery and Valero have purchased CPC crude since the Ukraine crisis. PBF has not, however, received any cargoes since May.Chevron and PBF did not immediately reply to requests for comment.Chios, a Greek-flagged vessel chartered by Chevron, loaded CPC crude at Novorossiysk and was signaling discharge this month at El Segundo, California, according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. Chevron operates a refinery there.Aristofanis was the latest vessel to discharge CPC crude in the United States, according to U.S. customs data. The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker was chartered by Valero Energy and discharged crude at Long Beach and Benicia in California.Aigeorgis, another Valero-chartered vessel that according to Refinitiv Eikon is carrying CPC Blend crude, also signaled Benicia as its destination. It has been anchored off the southern California coast for about three weeks.Valero and CPC Pipeline Consortium did not reply to a request for comment.U.S. authorities in June allowed an oil tanker traveling from Russia to New Orleans to unload after checking whether the cargo was Russian. A source familiar with the matter had said the shipment was of Kazakh oil products. (Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

This is expected to be October 14, 2022. In that report, analysts expect UnitedHealth Group to post earnings of $5.45 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 20.58%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $80.72 billion, up 11.59% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $21.86 per share and revenue of $322.21 billion, which would represent changes of +14.93% and +12.04%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this largest U.S. health insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.98%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, UnitedHealth was expected to post earnings of $5.24 per share, but it reported $5.57 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.30%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.40 per share, while it actually produced $5.49 per share, a surprise of 1.67%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor UnitedHealth, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UnitedHealth currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.08%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 14, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(Change Healthcare) (Nashville, TN) [NASDAQ:CHNG], a leading health care technology company. The outlooks of these Credit Ratings (ratings) remain stable.The close of this transaction had been delayed following the antitrust suit from the U.S. Department of Justice; however, the U.S. federal judge cleared the way for the transaction to be completed late in September. The close of the transaction was announced on Oct. 3, 2022. The transaction is valued at approximately $14 billion, and includes $5.3 billion debt of Change Healthcare that UnitedHealth Group retired. UnitedHealth Group has financed the transaction with cash on hand and short-term debt, which likely is to be converted to long-term debt later in fourth-quarter 2022.Following the transaction, AM Best anticipates an increase in financial leverage to above 40% and decline in interest coverage at year-end 2022 and through 2023. However, UnitedHealth Group has managed its financial leverage at 40% over the long term, and has experienced temporary fluctuations following sizeable acquisitions. AM Best anticipates that the group will continue to deploy deleveraging actions to revert to the 40% range over the next 12 months, as it has done in the past. UnitedHealth Group also has a high level of financial flexibility, supported by its large commercial paper program, parent company cash and substantial subsidiary dividend capacity, as well as a revolving credit facility of $15 billion. Furthermore, UnitedHealth Group has significant nonregulated operating earnings and cash flows from its Optum operations, which include OptumRx, Optum Health and OptumInsight.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

(NYSE:EL) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/59-ownership-shares-est-e-120042055.html,1664971242,STORY,['EL'],"[Every investor in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 59% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Estée Lauder Companies. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Estée Lauder Companies?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Estée Lauder Companies does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Estée Lauder Companies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Estée Lauder Companies is not owned by hedge funds. Lal Family Partners, LP is currently the largest shareholder, with 23% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.. Insiders own US$6.5b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Estée Lauder Companies. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 23%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Estée Lauder Companies better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Estée Lauder Companies , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

351,dc82146f-75cf-3fae-a81a-786ef289ce64,UDR,2022-10-05,Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why UDR (UDR) is a Solid Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-growth-stock-3-reasons-164504457.html,1664901904,STORY,['UDR'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends UDR (UDR) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this real estate investment trust a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for UDR is 2.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, UDR has an S/TA ratio of 0.13, which means that the company gets $0.13 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.12, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And UDR looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 16.5% this year versus the industry average of 11.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for UDR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineUDR has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that UDR is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Principal Financial has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while BlackRock has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PFG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BLK has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PFG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.70, while BLK has a forward P/E of 17.05. We also note that PFG has a PEG ratio of 1.97. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BLK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.03.Another notable valuation metric for PFG is its P/B ratio of 1.72. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BLK has a P/B of 2.32.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PFG's Value grade of A and BLK's Value grade of D.PFG sticks out from BLK in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PFG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, both Regal Beloit and Eaton are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.RRX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.50, while ETN has a forward P/E of 18.24. We also note that RRX has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.66.Another notable valuation metric for RRX is its P/B ratio of 1.53. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 3.34.Based on these metrics and many more, RRX holds a Value grade of B, while ETN has a Value grade of C.Both RRX and ETN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that RRX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Karl Sievertsen, vice president of engineering and chief technology officer for Eaton's Vehicle Group, discusses how to prepare for upcoming changes and what technology will help maximize fuel efficiency and increase operational effectiveness.TranscriptZARI VENHAUS: Hi, I'm Zari Venhaus, Vice President of Corporate Marketing Communications, and we're here for another Eaton 10 in 10 podcast. There's a lot of talk today about the electrification of vehicles. But in the commercial vehicle space, the diesel engine is still king.We are here with Karl Sievertsen, the Chief Technology Officer of our Vehicle Group, to talk more about vehicle emission standards and fuel economy. Can you give me a quick overview of the regulations affecting commercial vehicle emissions?KARL SIEVERTSEN: The regulations that you speak of primarily involving fuel economy--Improving fuel economy, and thereby lowering CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas effect, protecting the environment. And harmful emissions, oxides of nitrogen, which produce ozone and can be harmful to humans. So those are the two main constituents that the regulatory bodies are trying to reduce and improve.ZARI VENHAUS: What are the specific reduction goals that the regulations are targeting?KARL SIEVERTSEN: A fuel efficiency improvement that's mandated anywhere between 15% and 30%, while at the same time, reducing the harmful emission of oxides of nitrogen by almost an order of magnitude. So we're talking up to 90% reduction from our output today, which is substantial. But making that even more complicated is learning from the dieselgate experiences et cetera is the testing is becoming more stringent, more real world.Also, measuring at low loads. So vehicles do spend a fair amount of time idling or operating at low load, not always at full power. And it's at those times where right now, they're producing some of their highest emissions, if you will.Story continuesZARI VENHAUS: OK, so they're really targeting reducing emissions and use cases where the potential for exposure in highly populated areas is great, like in cities. So how will that impact innovation in this space?KARL SIEVERTSEN: The regulations are really honing in on minimizing and controlling emissions during those use cases as well or those operating modes. And so the overall level coming down, the more real world kind of measuring technique, and this focus on closing this low load exemption is what's really driving what we think is going to be quite a technology adoption revolution as you move past 2024.ZARI VENHAUS: So technically speaking, how difficult is it to achieve this in commercial vehicles?KARL SIEVERTSEN: In a diesel engine, for example, reducing NOx in, let's say, absence of monitoring CO2 is not, in itself, all that challenging.But doing them both together is the problem. Because there's been a traditional offset that if you want to reduce NOx, you're kind of detuning the combustion cycle in a way as to make it less efficient.So you get lower NOx, but also more fuel consumption, and vice versa, right? And what we're doing is working to break that paradigm. The needs of the market, the needs of the regulators, et cetera require that fuel economy go up and NOx production or emissions go down. And our technologies-- like CDA, like 48-volt EGR pumping-- have the capability and the design intent and the purpose of bringing benefits to both. Reducing NOx while improving fuel efficiency.ZARI VENHAUS: How is electrification going to play a role in this change?KARL SIEVERTSEN: As we look at the total commercial vehicle space, and we look at improving efficiencies and reducing harmful emissions, electrification is clearly going to play a role. It's going to play a role from moving to full battery electric vehicles, in some cases, especially with regard to buses and maybe urban transport and delivery. In terms of other use cases, there's a large potential benefit to start to electrify the commercial or the diesel powertrain that we have today.So in other words, add some electrification in order to make the total system more efficient, whether it's pulling accessory drives off the engine-- those are things like air conditioning compressors and power steering pumps, things that don't need to run all the time. And that by pulling them off and electrifying them, we actually make the diesel engine more efficient. To allowing for electric catalyst heating again, for harmful emissions reduction and so forth.ZARI VENHAUS: What about full battery electric for on-highway and long haul trucks?KARL SIEVERTSEN: When we think more about long haul, that becomes less practical in terms of not just the battery cost, which is coming down, but battery weight and energy density, and the effect that has on the amount of freight you can carry and the amount of range you can get in a truck.ZARI VENHAUS: What do fleet owners need to consider when preparing for electric options?KARL SIEVERTSEN: For them, it is really, really about total cost of ownership. They want the range, they love the diesel, they want the diesel to be more efficient. We can make that happen.And when the price points are such that the electrification is going to make sense for them, then they're going to pull hard. And this balance between total cost of ownership or, let's say, customer pull and regulatory environment is going to be what drives that balance as we move forward.ZARI VENHAUS: So as these 2024 regulations approach, how is Eaton innovating to meet the needs of our customers?KARL SIEVERTSEN: We expect to see more of a convergence of standards. And so we're working on those technologies that are going to help our customers meet those ever more stringent regulations beyond 2024. And I named a few of them, I think, in our conversation.We can, in terms of that catalyst heating and making the engine more efficient, we can introduce cylinder deactivation to the diesel engine. Which we've had for probably 15 years or more in the passenger car space.Eaton has produced millions of product that's in millions of engines on the road today. But we can take that space from that knowledge, that technique from the passenger car space, move it into the commercial diesel, and drive higher exhaust gas temperatures and lower fuel consumption in low load environments in that diesel space. So cylinder deactivation and variable valve actuation in general is something that we're working on. Even more efficient decompression engine braking for again, when those vehicles become more aerodynamic. And lower rolling resistance tires. They're going to need higher braking efficiencies to stop the vehicle when needed. So we're working on all of those technologies to work in conjunction with the diesel engine.ZARI VENHAUS: Can you talk a little about the benefits and the need for extensive testing for these applications?KARL SIEVERTSEN: We do a lot of engine dynamometer testing. We do a lot of testing at our research partners. But putting it all in one package on the vehicle and testing is important. And you hit on it, in addition and underlying foundationally, all those regulations with regard to emissions is an ever-increasing kind of durability warranty period that those devices have to be proven to be functional. So reliability and life of those emissions devices is also key.ZARI VENHAUS: And for our last question, what are we doing to meet today's needs while preparing for the future of commercial vehicles?KARL SIEVERTSEN: In our latest transmissions, we've improved efficiency, reduced gear train losses, improved end-user performance et cetera, and improved calibrations with our OEM partners, all to drive better performance, better fuel economy. Along our broader product range at Eaton, our valve business continues to introduce new materials and technologies that allow our customers to engineer more difficult and higher performance combustion cycles that put our components in a harsher environment, if you will. But we're there, stepping up and providing product that meets the challenge. And again, moving to improve efficiency.We're introducing hydraulic lash adjustment in these diesel engine spaces that will allow better warranty cycles, less service, let's say, tear up into the engine to do these valve adjustments.As the engine gets more complex, getting in to make things like valve adjustments becomes more complex. The less often we have to do that, the better. Our engine braking technology is improving performance and enabling some of the down speeding that drives fuel economy. So really across our product portfolio, we've had a fuel economy focus for many years now. And our new technologies really have us positioned well for the challenges of the future.ZARI VENHAUS: Thank you so much for these insights, Karl.

A surprising percentage of employees are ready to quit their jobs and start a business, and budget cutting due to the economy is reducing financial support for charity, friends and family only half as much as household spending. These are some of the findings of the recently released 2022 Aflac Risk Survey of 1,644 American adults. A leading provider of supplemental health insurance in the U.S., the $22 billion supplemental insurance company annually surveys Americans on matters of topical importance.Other findings from this year's survey include:Nearly 90% of Americans list proactively managing risks to mental health as a priority compared to 80% who are concerned about the state of the U.S. economy, 61% who are concerned about the effects of politics on their household, and 54% who are concerned about the impact of COVID-19.About 57% of Americans with incomes over $150,000 reported that ""proactively managing risks to your and your family's mental health"" has grown in importance over the last couple of years versus only 40% with incomes of $35,000 and under, pointing to a potential mental health equity gap.Nearly 1 in 6 Americans are somewhat or very likely to quit their jobs and start a business, including more than half of self-reported ""absolute risk-takers."" For those whose likelihood of starting their own business has changed in the past couple of years, more than 4 in 10 are more likely to do so, meaning that while people want to work, they don't necessarily want to work for another company.While 9 out of 10 of those making changes in household budgets are cutting their own spending, less than half are reducing the support they provide to friends, families and charitable causes they care most about.Story continues""After a major pandemic, economic challenges, social justice anxieties and political unrest, Americans are reassessing their approach to mental health, seeing it as a greater risk to themselves and their families than it was just two years ago,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Group Voluntary Benefits Bob Ruff. ""How people manage these risks has a lot to do with their income and education, showcasing the likelihood of a health care gap for mental illness that must be addressed.""In 2022, Aflac added mental health components to several products in response to a growing need for access to emotional and mental stress mitigation tools. According to the National Alliance on Mental Health, 21%, or nearly 53 million U.S. adults, experienced mental illness in 2020, and 46% of adults with mental illness received treatment. Serious mental illness causes $193.2 billion in lost earnings each year.1""The last two years have awakened an entrepreneurial spirit among Americans, particularly those who self-identify as 'risk takers,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Distribution Expansion and Consumer Markets Jeramy Tipton. ""While it seems that people want to work, they don't all necessarily want to work for someone else, which will have a significant impact on how people will obtain health care benefits potentially through consumer-directed platforms as the gig economy continues to grow. It is important to note, however, that risk-taking does not equal recklessness. These individuals take great care to manage risk since they know they cannot avoid it.""Aflac currently provides many consumer-directed products, including those for Cancer, Critical Illness, Accident, Final Expense Whole Life and Medicare Supplement. The company plans to add additional consumer-directed products to the roster of available policies in 2022 and 2023.The 2022 Aflac Risk Survey was conducted online July 8-9, 2022, among 1,644 American adults age 18 and older.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Realty Income Corp. O, Simon Property Group SPG, Kimco Realty Corp. KIM and Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Will Retail REITs Continue to Rebound This Holiday Season?The rising prices of commodities and the consequent impact on consumers' spending might have fueled fears among retailers and their landlords — retail REITs — for the upcoming holiday season. However, the favorable job-and-wage growth environment, which supports consumer confidence, and stimulus savings from last year are raising hopes. Predictions also suggest that retail sales will pick up during the holiday season.Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to surge 7.1% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period that runs from Nov 1-Dec 24. While in-store retail sales are projected to increase 7.9%, e-commerce is expected to rise 4.2%.Obviously, this is a positive for retail REITs like Realty Income Corp., Simon Property Group, Kimco Realty Corp.  and Federal Realty Investment Trust .The retail real estate industry is poised to benefit from the pent-up consumer demand as consumers look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience, following the pandemic downtime. Amid these, retailers' focus has now shifted from the closing of stores to the revival of their growth plans, resulting in more demand for physical store spaces and paving the way for the retail REITs to experience gain in leasing activity, pricing power and flourish.Retailers are also focusing on investments in their stores because apart from serving as showrooms, physical stores offer a convenient location for pick-up or exchange of goods, helping retailers counter the increasing costs associated with last-mile delivery.Story continuesFurthermore, amid limited availability and with the rapid formation of new businesses in the retail sector, lease signings, rent and occupancies in retail real estates are likely to get a boost. This will support the growth of retail REITs like Realty Income, Simon Property, Kimco Realty, Federal Realty and others.Moreover, omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This is quite evident from the recent foot traffic at retail destinations.Digitally native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy as the opening of stores helps them improve their connection with customers and drive expansion.In fact, for retailers, the focus now is not only on boosting their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations. Also, with the waning impact of the pandemic, entertainment and dining concepts are seeing a revival, boosting retail REITs' growth scopes.Nevertheless, inflationary pressure, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings might temper consumers' willingness to spend to some extent. With office usage affected and international tourism yet to regain lost ground, certain submarkets also remain choppy.Moreover, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers. This is likely to affect the market share for brick-and-mortar stores and hurt demand for retail REITs' properties.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 American Stocks That Will Benefit from the New Cold War. A March 2022 survey indicated that more than 6 in 10 American adults believe that the chance of a Cold War is now greater than it was five years ago. However, President Biden announced in a United Nations meeting on September 21 that “we do not seek a Cold War” and that the US was not asking “any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.” However, foreign policy experts largely believe that with the US on one side and Russia and China as its opponents, a Cold War is already happening.The United States’ lead in productivity, technology, and average company size means its economy is still stronger than China’s, which is the largest manufacturing and exporting entity in the world, but the gap between the two superpowers is far less than was the case between the US and the U.S.S.R. in the old Cold War. If sanctions or trade wars become obvious between the United States and China, there are many American stocks that stand to benefit from this scenario. Some of the companies that will be clear winners amid the new Cold War include Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT). Our Methodology We selected American companies operating in the cybersecurity, defense and military, lithium, and precious metals sectors. During geopolitical unrest, cyber safety and military firms experience higher demand. Similarly, China is the largest lithium and precious metals exporter, and a war means the United States and its allies might cut reliance on the country, which will boost domestic firms working in the sector. The hedge fund sentiment around the securities was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database of about 900 elite hedge funds. American Stocks That Will Benefit from the New Cold War10. Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) Story continuesNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Foster City, California. It is a cloud-based provider of information technology, security, and compliance solutions in the United States and internationally. Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS)’s product suites enable customers to identify and manage IT assets, collect and analyze IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, and verify the implementation of such actions. As cyber threats increase in the midst of the new Cold War, demand for firms like Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) skyrockets. On August 9, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $150 from $160. The analyst noted the company delivered robust Q2 results that came in ahead of the Street's expectations as Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) continues to show deal momentum in the field.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 23 hedge funds were bullish on Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $300 million, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter worth $328 million. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the leading position holder in the company, with 930,206 shares valued at $117.3 million. Like Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) is one of the American stocks that will benefit from the new Cold War. Here is what Headwaters Capital specifically said about Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS) was founded in 1999 and provides vulnerability management software to both SMBs and enterprise customers. Vulnerability management software provides a continuous view of security and compliance across all of a company’s assets including on-premise, end-points, cloud and mobile. The easiest way to think about QLYS’s original VM solution is that it provided a dashboard that monitored all potential threats to a network and helped IT departments prioritize which vulnerabilities were the highest risk. QLYS was a pioneer in the industry as they were one of the first companies to offer a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solution as opposed to the traditional license offerings that proliferated at the time. While QLYS’ VM software has always provided an industry leading dashboard to monitor weaknesses, it provided limited functionality to respond to these vulnerabilities. More recently, QLYS has increased the functionality of its software through the rollout of Detection and Response capabilities (VMDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities in late 2021.The cybersecurity space has been marked by a preference of customers for point solution expertise as opposed to a winner take all solution. This market structure is driven by the complex nature of assets that need protection, the dynamic nature of security threats and the critical nature of cybersecurity, which leads to a customer preference for quality over cost. Historically, cybersecurity was best served by firewalls, which provided a ring fence around assets that were physically located on a network. Firewalls are increasingly becoming obsolete in the cybersecurity world as the network perimeter has effectively disappeared due to the growing adoption of SaaS solutions and new connected devices that connect to the network from multiple new endpoints. This trend has only accelerated following COVID. As more devices and software tools connect from outside of the traditional firewall perimeter, the importance of security monitoring tools such as VM, VMDR and XDR has increased. In many ways, vulnerability management is the foundation of cybersecurity as it provides the dashboard for monitoring all potential security gaps. QLYS’ software can provide critical data about which assets are exposed to specific threats and can increasingly help IT departments prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities.Understanding QLYS’s history is important to gaining confidence in QLYS’ ability to maintain revenue growth going forward. QLYS was almost perfectly positioned earlier this decade to take advantage of both the transition in the software market from license to SaaS solutions as well as the cybersecurity trend away from firewalls as devices increasingly moved beyond a physical perimeter. Given the large TAM, industry tailwinds and a market leading product, QLYS was able to growth revenues at a +20% CAGR from 2012-2018. Even more impressive, QLYS was able to accomplish this growth with limited investment in R&amp;D or its sales force. R&amp;D as a percentage of revenues declined from 22% in 2012 to 16% in 2018 while S&amp;M declined from 40% in 2012 to 22% in 2018. Consequently, QLYS operates with one of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry at 45%. The ability for QLYS to post such consistent revenue growth despite under-investing in product development and sales is evidence of the strong competitive positioning of QLYS’ software and the critical nature of the product…” (Click here to read more)9.

Freeport’s share price declined in Q2 with other large miners as a result, and we think the response by market participants is overdone. The company continues to generate strong free cash flow, which it has returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We also remain attracted to Freeport’s unique exposure to high-quality copper producing mines, which is a key industrial input, particularly for green technologies, and we believe it’s a strong business oriented toward strengthening end markets.""Photo by Stephen Philpott on UnsplashStory continuesFreeport-McMoRan Inc.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Regeneron has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Repligen has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that REGN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.REGN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.94, while RGEN has a forward P/E of 62.30. We also note that REGN has a PEG ratio of 2.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. RGEN currently has a PEG ratio of 8.90.Another notable valuation metric for REGN is its P/B ratio of 3.87. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Recently, REGN crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.The 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Moving Average Chart for REGNREGN has rallied 26.6% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests REGN could be on the verge of another move higher.Once investors consider REGN's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has been lowered in the past two months, compared to 5 raised estimates, for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has increased as well.Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on REGN for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, 2022 has seen a massive decline from those levels, thereby pulling down the year-over-year growth.While sales in 2021 came in at $5.8 billion in the United States, sales in the first half of 2022 were negligible as FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV, as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant.  Therefore, REGEN-COV is not currently authorized for use in any U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions. Sales outside the country came in at $658.4 million in the first half of 2022.Further, with the pandemic largely under control, sales of COVID-19 treatments will decline.Regeneron, however, has many arms in its arsenal. Lead drug Eylea (aflibercept), approved for various ophthalmology indications, has been a steady growth driver and should maintain momentum on sustained label expansions.The company recently announced that the two studies evaluating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) were successful. The company is evaluating a higher dose of aflibercept with less frequent injections in the targeted population. The results impressed investors and should bode well for Eylea.Regeneron is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY. While REGN records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.However, stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weigh on Eylea and has been an overhang on Regeneron’s shares in recent months.Story continuesIn January 2022, Roche RHHBY won FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) to treat wAMD and DME. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. It has ongoing long-term extension studies for Vabysmo in people with nAMD and DME. The European Commission too recently approved Vabysmo (faricimab) for these indications.Another growth driver in Regeneron’s armory is Dupixent, for which it has a collaboration with Sanofi SNY. Solid sales of Dupixent (approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis) have boosted the top line significantly. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while REGN records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of the drug.Regeneron is also looking to make a place in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo, indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While Libtayo holds promise, competition is stiff in this oncology space with many formidable drugs. Hence, Libtayo has a long way to go before contributing significantly to the top line.Regeneron is also looking to foray into the challenging but promising nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) space with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing therapy with Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Dupixent is being jointly marketed by Regeneron REGN and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of the drug.Dupixent is now annualizing at close to €6.0 billion in sales after around five years on the market. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in peak sales. Dupixent now is approved in the United States and the EU for three type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It was approved for the fourth disease indication, eosinophilic esophagitis, in the United States in May 2022. The frequent label expansion approvals are driving the drug’s sales higher. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications and expansion in younger patient populations expected in the near future, sales are expected to be higherSanofi possesses one of the world’s leading vaccine operations, with total annual sales of more than €5 billion in the past five years. Its vaccine unit has become the primary top-line driver. Sanofi expects sales in its Vaccine unit to grow at a mid-to-high single-digit CAGR from 2018 to 2025. Sanofi is also developing an adjuvanted recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidatein partnership with GSK GSK. The vaccine is being developed by combining Sanofi’s recombinant protein-based technology with Glaxo’s pandemic adjuvant technology.Glaxo and Sanofi began a pivotal phase III study on the candidate in May. Meanwhile, a booster study is also planned to complement the phase III study.Sanofi’s R&amp;D pipeline is strong. Several data readouts are expected in 2022.Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years. Some recent key drug approvals are Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa) for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease, a rare degenerative muscle disorder and Enjaymo (sutimlimab-jome) for hemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease, a rare blood disorder, in 2022.Story continuesSanofi is also expanding its pipeline through M&amp;A deals. The Principia acquisition in 2020 added BTK inhibitors like tolebrutinib and rilzabrutinib to its pipeline, which can address a variety of serious illnesses. The acquisition of Translate Bio in September 2021 accelerated Sanofi’s efforts to develop transformative vaccines and therapies using mRNA technology. The Kadmon acquisition added Rezurock, Kadmon’s FDA-approved treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease to Sanofi’s portfolio.ConclusionSanofi faces its share of headwinds, including the weak performance of diabetes drugs and generic competition for many drugs. Also, macroeconomic headwinds such as increased cost of energy, transportation, as well as labor costs are hurting margins. The impact of volume-based procurement in China is also expected to hurt gross margins. Nonetheless, the strong performance of Dupixent, above-market sales growthof the Consumer unit, consistent pipeline innovation and regular accretive collaboration deals should keep the stock afloat in the second half and thereafter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively) and was designed specifically to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Roche for the same.While Regeneron has co-developed Eylea with Bayer’s HealthCare unit, Praluent was co-developed with Sanofi. Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo in the United States, and Sanofi records the same outside the country. Both the companies equally share profits/losses in connection with global sales of Libtayo. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, Kevzara and Zaltrap. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara. Sanofi pays the company a percentage of net sales of Zaltrap.Regeneron collaborated with Bayer for the joint development and commercialization of co-formulated combinations of Eylea, rinucumab and nesvacumab for the treatment of ocular diseases or disorders outside the United States. In September 2016, Regeneron and Teva announced a global agreement for the development and commercialization of the former’s experimental nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody, fasinumab.Regeneron’s revenues comprise collaboration revenues, net product sales and technology licensing and other revenues. Total revenues of $8.5 billion in 2021 were up 30% from sales in 2020. Eylea sales came in at $5.8 billion in the United States.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Regeneron, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $4,650.66, or a 365.07% gain, as of October 4, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 153.51% and the price of gold went up -8.74% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for REGN.Regeneron’s performance has been strong with broad-based growth. Solid demand for Eylea and Dupixent maintained momentum for the company. However, sales from REGEN-COV took a hit due to its lack of efficacy against the Omicron variant and might weaken further.  Nevertheless, growth in Eylea and Dupixent through further penetration in existing indications should maintain momentum. The approval of Libtayo for the lucrative indication of lung cancer is likely to drive the drug’s sales in the upcoming quarters. Regeneron has a deep and diversified pipeline, and approval of new drugs will further expand the portfolio. However, Regeneron relies on Eylea for the bulk of its sales, and the drug is likely to face stiff competition from the recently approved therapies. Shares have underperformed the industry in the past three months.The stock is up 26.61% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 5 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

If you want to skip the fund’s history, recent performance and details about its overall portfolio, please go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn.Billionaire Sir Chris Hohn is the founder of The Children’s Investment, or TCI Fund Management, a London-based hedge fund. Mr. Hohn was born in 1966 in Addlestone, Surrey, in a working-class family. His father was a car mechanic, and his mother was a legal secretary. He graduated with a first-class honours degree in accounting and business economics from the University of Southampton. On being advised by one of his tutors at the University of Southampton, Mr. Hohn applied to the Harvard Business School (HBS) for an MBA. At HBS, he graduated among the top 5% of his batch, becoming one of the Baker Scholars, the institution’s highest award for academic achievement. He worked at multiple noted PE and hedge funds in New York and London for a few years before setting up TCI Fund Management in 2003.TCI takes a long-term, value-oriented approach while investing and strongly focuses on environmental, social and governance issues. It is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, with over $50 billion in assets under management.Mr. Hohn is also a well-known philanthropist, having donated billions of dollars to charitable causes over the years. He is a founder and major supporter of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a UK-based charity that works to improve the lives of children in developing countries. He has also given large sums of money to educational causes and environmental causes.Mr. Hohn is well known on Wall Street and in the financial center of London for his aggressive negotiating style. He has been involved in a number of high-profile battles with companies, including a successful campaign to force the reform of the London Stock Exchange. He is also a passionate supporter of greater disclosure of information by companies and has been critical of the way in which some banks have operated in the past.Story continuesFor his philanthropic contributions, Mr. Hohn was knighted in 2014. The Children’s Investment Fund Management has generated strong returns since it was founded. In 2021, the fund generated a return of 23.3% for its investors, making it the sixth of the past seven years when TCI reported double-digit gains.TCI Fund Management’s Portfolio The value of TCI Fund Management’s 13F portfolio declined to $31.6 billion at the end of Q2 from $36.84 billion at the end of March. Because the fund has always run a concentrated portfolio, there was not much churning seen in TCI Fund Management’s portfolio during Q2.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) continued to be among TCI Fund Management’s top 10 stock picks at the end of Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris HohnChris HohnOur MethodologyAt Insider Monkey, we cover the portfolios of 895 hedge funds, closely tracking the stocks they buy and sell. We selected the ten stocks discussed in this article based on the 13F regulatory filing submitted by TCI Fund Management with the SEC for the quarter ending June 30. These are the top ten picks of Hohn's fund, according to its second quarter portfolio.10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn10. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $172,633,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was the only stock among its top stock picks in which  TCI Fund Management initiated a new stake during Q2. Founded in 1967, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is among the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the world. Due to macro uncertainty and supply chain issues the semiconductor industry has been facing in the last few quarters, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) recently got featured in Insider Monkey’s list of 5 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch as Uncertainty Grows.One of the major reasons TCI Fund Management decided to buy the stock during the second quarter could be the drastic decline it has suffered this year. Having lost close to 48% of its value year-to-date, Applied Materials, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock currently trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of only 10.95.On September 28, analysts at Barclays reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while reducing their price target to $85 from $95, which represents almost no potential upside from where the stock is currently trading.9. Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $940,029,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 2.97%    Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Although TCI Fund Management reduced its stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) by 10% during the second quarter, the stock’s popularity among smart money investors saw a massive jump during that time. From just 21 hedge funds among those covered by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) at the end of March, the number jumped to 32 at the end of June. Funds that initiated a stake in the company during the second quarter included billionaire Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Ken Heebner’s Capital Growth Management, and Jinghua Yan’s TwinBeech Capital.Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP), as the name suggests, is based in Boston, Massachusetts and is currently the country’s largest publicly-held developer and owner of Class A office properties. It focuses on five major property markets in the country: Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC. On September 20, Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) announced that it had acquired a six-story life sciences property with a total area of 271,000 square feet adjacent to Kendall Center from Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). The gross purchase price of this deal was around $592 million, and Biogen has leased the property back from Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP) and will continue to occupy the premise until April 2028.8. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $1,120,178,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 3.54%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Railroad major Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) stock seems to be following the trajectory of a roller coaster this year. Having started the year near the $200 level, it reached its lifetime high of $278.94 in May, but has pared all that gain as it currently trades flat year-to-date. Why following smart money can reap rich rewards for ordinary investors can be gauged from how smart money has played this stock. Between mid-2017 and the first quarter of this year, when the stock rose from $100 levels to $250 levels, hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that reported a stake in Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) climbed from 49 to 90. However, that number fell all the way down to 65 in just one quarter.On September 15, executives at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and other railroad majors breathed a sigh of relief. After many months of negotiations, US railway workers and companies finally reached an agreement averting a potential strike that could have caused another logistical nightmare like what we saw post-COVID. Out of the 19 analysts on Wall Street who currently cover Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) 12 have a ‘Hold’ rating on it with a consensus price target of $243.57, implying a 22.6% potential upside from the stock’s last closing price.7. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,242,721,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 7.09%                Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is the oldest stock pick of TCI Fund Management that still finds a presence in the fund’s 13F portfolio. TCI Fund Management had first reported initiating a stake in the ratings and analysis company in a regulatory filing for the last quarter of 2012. During Q2, TCI Fund Management upped its stake in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) by 14%. Other funds covered by us that also increased their holdings in the company during the same period included billionaire D. E. Shaw’s fund D E Shaw, which boosted its stake by 166% to 60,674 shares, and Dev Kantesaria’s Valley Forge Capital, which upped its holdings by 8% to 1.16 million shares.For its third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is scheduled to report its earnings on October 28. The current consensus among analysts is that the company would declare a GAAP EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $1.4 billion for that period. On September 27, analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the stock while upping their price target on it slightly to $288 from $283, representing a potential upside of 16.8% from the stock’s last closing price.6. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)TCI Fund Management’s Stake Value: $2,955,450,000Percentage of TCI Fund Management’s 13F Portfolio: 9.35%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Like Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is another stock in which TCI Fund Management has held a stake for a long time and boosted its holding further – by 29% – during the second quarter. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) have been among the most consistent compounding stocks over the past several years. However, among funds tracked by Insider Monkey, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) ranks way ahead in popularity when compared to Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO).In its second quarter investors letter published recently, Investment management company Ave Maria had this to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI):“S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a data-driven financial services company with leading franchises in the areas of data and analytics, credit rating, commodity insights and indices. S&amp;P Global benefits from several secular trends including the disintermediation of banks, a shift to passive investing, and an increased focus on ESG, Climate &amp; Energy Transition.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn. Suggested articles:11 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio10 Best Junior Silver Mining Stocks14 Best Clean Energy Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Hohn is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Union Pacific in FocusBased in Omaha, Union Pacific (UNP) is in the Transportation sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -20.51%. The railroad is paying out a dividend of $1.3 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.6% compared to the Transportation - Rail industry's yield of 1.37% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.78%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.20 is up 21.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Union Pacific has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.93%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Union Pacific's current payout ratio is 48%, meaning it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNP is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $11.55 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 16.08%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNP presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.Meet Beamlink, a startup based out of the U.S. that won a $75,000 USD Regional First Runner-Up Prize in the Americas region.Beamlink's Chief Technology Officer, Arpad Kovesdy, has a background in the aerospace industry and a passion for spacecraft electronics. Beamlink CEO, Mateo Abascal, focuses his energy where social entrepreneurship meets technology. He's leveraged tech to solve issues from food donation distribution to the delivery of prosthetics and ventilators. DC Palter, Beamlink Chief Marketing Officer, is a startup founder and marketing expert with 25 years in the computer networking space.The team has designed and built a cellular mesh networking solution that connects people affected by natural disasters, when communications infrastructure is down, while also broadening access to vital connectivity in rural underserved areas of the U.S. (and eventually all over the world).I recently had an enlightening conversation with the team about their innovative, award-winning technology.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Mateo: Nearly half of the global population lacks access to mobile internet connectivity.This is an issue literally everywhere in the world. It is an issue here in Los Angeles, where we're based. It's an issue for rural farms in America. It goes far beyond the U.S. I mean, you pick a country, you pick a region…this is an issue somewhere for someone.Story continuesWe want to make it easy to connect your phone to a new cellular network. Our overall goal is to make an impact.Can you explain how the solution works?Arpad: We're using mesh technology to connect a large number of small devices, known as a BentoCell, to expand coverage across a broader area. And each BentoCell device is inexpensive and requires little power.You just scan a QR code and then immediately your phone will recognize the network and connect to it. It requires no technical background. There are a lot of algorithms running in the background that just configure everything that usually has to be done by a radio engineer. And all you have to do on the ground is just press the power button and it will configure everything on its own.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?DC: BentoCell is a cell tower in your hand.Arpad: We can basically set-up a new cellular network from zero. And whether that is after a natural disaster or in a rural area that has never had solid connectivity before, it doesn't really matter, because our devices are extremely simple to use. All the hard stuff is done in software in the cloud - you don't have to think about it.Mateo: It's also extremely decentralized in that there's no set architecture that you have to use to set-up your network. You could have hundreds of thousands of these devices in an area and they would still play along with each other and help create a massive network.Arpad: Since it is software defined, you can operate completely standalone if you have no licenses. We can utilize CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) or unlicensed frequencies. We can operate a completely independent cell network that can be private, it could be semi-private, it just depends on the use case.What inspired you to develop this solution?Mateo: We were on the ground in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. A lot of our initial customer discovery was on the ground in Houston, a lot of our initial market analysis and technical modeling.Then Hurricane Maria happened and it was a complete communications blackout. We weren't in Puerto Rico at the time, but our solution was informed by a problem that became clear during these hurricanes.When a disaster hits, one of the first things that will get wiped out is connectivity. Repairing anything, getting resources to survivors in the area, just showing up to the area and figuring out where to go and who needs help, everything to some extent relies on connectivity.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Mateo: We're hoping to address a lot more than disaster response. Disaster response for us is a beachhead, especially in light of global climate change, but we eventually want to provide mobile connectivity to all in need.Arpad: In 2021 we entered the Global Problem Solver Challenge and we were a finalist. We didn't win an award last year. But, as a finalist, for Cisco to simply recognize the issues surrounding digital inclusivity is validating.DC: We are a networking company, so a name like Cisco behind us is just huge.Do you know what you will use the prize money for specifically?DC: We have funding from a National Science Foundation grant for the development of the product. But that only covers the actual development work. We can't fund anything other than the actual engineering with that.This funding makes a big difference in helping us run the business beyond just doing the development work. All the things like customer discovery, talking to customers, marketing, human resources, and the general day-to-day.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Mateo: I think every problem is different. I would say talk, talk, talk to your customers. Know the problem and know who you are solving it for.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/718760/Beamlink-How-a-Cellular-Mesh-Networking-Solution-Connects-People-During-Natural-Disasters]"
