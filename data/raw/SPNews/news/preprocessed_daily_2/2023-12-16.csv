This article delves into the details of the transaction, the background of Martijn Hagman, and an analysis of insider trading patterns in relation to PVH Corp's stock price."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with USPH.', 'Martijn Hagman has been a prominent figure in the fashion industry, particularly known for his leadership roles within PVH Corp. As the CEO of TH Global and PVH Europe, Hagman oversees the operations of some of the most recognized brands in the apparel sector. His strategic vision and management have been instrumental in steering the company through the dynamic landscape of global fashion and retail.', ""PVH Corp is a global apparel company that boasts a portfolio of iconic brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Van Heusen. With a presence in over 40 countries, PVH Corp has established itself as a leader in designing and marketing a wide range of products, including sportswear, jeanswear, underwear, and footwear. The company's commitment to quality, innovation, and sustainability has solidified its position in the competitive fashion industry."", ""Insider trading activities, particularly those of high-ranking executives, can provide valuable insights into a company's health and future prospects. In the case of PVH Corp, the insider transaction history shows a lack of insider purchases over the past year, with four insider sells recorded during the same period. This could signal a cautious or bearish sentiment among those with intimate knowledge of the company's operations and potential."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of PVH Corp were trading at $115.26, giving the company a market cap of $7.067 billion. This valuation places the stock at a price-earnings ratio of 13.97, which is lower than both the industry median of 19.09 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. Such a lower price-earnings ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers, or it could reflect market skepticism about the company's growth prospects."", 'When considering the price-to-GF-Value ratio, PVH Corp appears to be modestly overvalued with a ratio of 1.21, based on a trading price of $115.26 and a GuruFocus Value of $95.04. The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate from GuruFocus, which takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates.', ""The insider trend image above illustrates the recent selling pattern, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term appreciation potential. However, it is also important to consider that insiders may sell shares for various reasons unrelated to their outlook on the company, such as personal financial planning or diversifying their investment portfolio."", ""The GF Value image provides a visual representation of the stock's valuation in relation to its intrinsic value. The current modest overvaluation suggests that investors may want to exercise caution, as the stock price may have limited upside potential based on the GF Value estimate."", ""The recent insider sell by CEO Martijn Hagman is a significant event that warrants attention from PVH Corp shareholders and potential investors. While the lower price-earnings ratio could indicate an undervalued stock, the modest overvaluation based on the GF Value suggests that the current stock price may already reflect much of the company's intrinsic value. As always, insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle, and investors should consider a comprehensive analysis of the company's financials, market position, and growth prospects before making investment decisions."", ""It is also crucial to monitor further insider transactions and broader market trends that could impact the stock's performance.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:', '13% = US$5.9b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""At first glance, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's moderate 17% growth over the past five years amongst other factors."", ""Next, on comparing Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 21% over the last few years."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TMO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""In Thermo Fisher Scientific's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 5.8% (or a retention ratio of 94%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business."", ""Moreover, Thermo Fisher Scientific is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 6.0% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is predicted to rise to 18% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio."", ""On the whole, we feel that Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

This takes the dividend yield to 4.4%, which shareholders will be pleased with."", ' Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, U.S. Bancorp has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 57%, which means that U.S. Bancorp would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet."", 'The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 37.1%. The future payout ratio could be 44% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.78 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.96. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.7% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, U.S. Bancorp's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 3.9% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", 'Overall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.', 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation.

The central bank has also indicated a 75 basis points cut in rates by 2024-end. The above-mentioned developments have attributed to bullish investor sentiments.

In May 2023, Nvidia’s (NVDA) market value “briefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time.

Despite the impressive run for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in 2023, many large-cap stocks have underperformed for various reasons. The three highly-ranked stocks we dig into today—DocuSign (DOCU), Nike (NKE), and Target (TGT)—are all trading at least 30% below their highs and could be poised for serious comebacks in 2024.', 'Jay Powell and the Fed gave the green light to the bulls on Wednesday when the world’s most important central bank signaled the possibility of three rate cuts in 2024. The 10-year U.S. Treasury is back below 4% (3.92%) after sitting at 5% in late October as Wall Street rapidly prices in lower rates.', 'The Fed’s newfound dovishness finally confirms what the bulls have been saying and doing for a large chunk of 2023 and certainly since the end of October. The S&P 500 appears on the cusp of summiting a new peak by the end of 2023 or early 2024.', 'All of this strength came before we even entered the official Santa Claus rally period, which includes the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.', 'There will likely be some selling and choppiness in the weeks and months ahead. Still, more money is poised to flow into stocks in 2024 as the calculus on cash and bonds changes and investors grow increasingly nervous about missing out again.', 'DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU)', 'DocuSign crushed our Q3 FY24 EPS estimate on December 7 and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. DOCU stock has soared 30% in the last month to retake its 50-day, its 200-day, and its long-term 50-week moving averages. Yet, the e-signature stock still trades over 80% below its record highs after it got crushed for slowing growth and weak bottom-line results.', 'DOCU’s revenue soared following its 2018 IPO, including four straight years of between 35% to 49% growth (19% last year in FY23). The company remains a powerhouse of electronic signatures, document generation, and beyond as medical forms, legal documents, and much more are becoming increasingly paperless. DocuSign has responded to its slower growth and higher rate environment by cutting costs, changing leadership, and rolling out other efforts to streamline its business.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'DocuSign’s valuation levels remain sky-high. But DOCU is focused on the bottom line. Investors might want to consider the e-signature and digital document firm with 1.4 million customers as Wall Street begins to search high and low for technology stocks that are still trading far below their highs.', 'Nike, Inc. (NKE)', 'Nike trades around 30% below its highs heading into its Q2 FY24 earnings release on December 21. Wall Street sold Nike shares based on fears about growing competition and other headwinds. NKE also got caught up in the broader consumer discretionary selloff. Nike certainly faces increased competition from relative newcomers Hoka and On in the running shoe segment and among consumers looking for maximum comfort and support at their jobs. Adidas, Lululemon, and digital native upstarts are also fighting for a larger share of the so-called streetwear market or the fashion end of sportswear.', 'Despite more challengers, Nike remains the heavyweight champion of sportswear and one of the most valuable brands in the world alongside the likes of Coca-Cola. NKE has treaded down a new direct-to-consumer-heavy path in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Nike’s sales are projected to climb 4% this year and over 8% higher next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 16% and 17%, respectively, based on Zacks estimates.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Nike’s earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now and its Shoes and Retail Apparel segment is in the top 23% of over 250 Zacks industries. Nike has climbed 850% during the last 15 years vs. the S&P 500’s 420% and its sector’s 220%. Nike is up 73% in the past five years, even though it trades 30% below its highs. Nike has retaken its 50-day and 200-day and is on the cusp of climbing above its very long-term 50-month moving average. Nike trades near its 10-year median at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings and pays a dividend.', 'Target (TGT)', 'Target posted blowout Q3 earnings results in mid-November and provided upbeat guidance that helped it capture a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The strong bottom-line performance extended its recent rebound that has TGT stock up 30% since the start of the fourth quarter. Even with the comeback, the retail standout trades 45% below its highs.', 'TGT’s resurgence has taken it right to its 50-week moving average and solidly above its 200-day and 50-day. Target trades at a 30% discount to its sector, 32% below Walmart (WMT), and close to TGT’s 10-year median. TGT stock is far more than a plummeting pandemic winner. Target crushed Walmart over the last 15 years, up 310% vs. 170% despite its massive fall from its 2021 highs.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last year-plus. The firm is also dealing with other setbacks. But it appears that TGT is finally finding its footing again. TGT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar 39% this year and then climb another 9% higher next year.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with MGM.', ""John McManus has been an integral part of MGM Resorts International, serving as the company's Chief Legal Officer, Administrative Officer, and Secretary. His role involves overseeing legal affairs, regulatory and compliance matters, and administrative functions. McManus's position places him in the inner circle of decision-making at MGM, making his stock transactions particularly noteworthy to the market observers."", ""MGM Resorts International is a global entertainment company with a portfolio of destination resort brands around the world. The company owns and operates a variety of hotels, casinos, and golf courses, as well as entertainment venues and luxury retail outlets. MGM's well-known properties include the Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and The Mirage, among others. The company's operations are primarily based in the United States, with significant presence in Las Vegas, but it also has a growing footprint in China and other international markets."", ""Insider transactions can be a powerful indicator of a company's health and future performance. Over the past year, John McManus has sold a total of 80,000 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity could signal a lack of confidence in the company's future growth or a belief that the stock may be overvalued. However, it's also important to consider that insiders may sell shares for various reasons unrelated to their outlook on the company, such as personal financial planning or diversifying their investments."", ""The broader insider transaction history for MGM Resorts International shows a pattern of more sales than purchases over the past year, with 17 insider sells and no insider buys.

This price point is below the industry median price-earnings ratio of 19.525, indicating that MGM may be undervalued compared to its peers. However, the price-earnings ratio is higher than the company's historical median, suggesting that the stock may not be as attractive as it has been in the past."", 'When considering the price-to-GF-Value ratio, which stands at 0.61 based on a GF Value of $72.80, MGM Resorts International appears to be a Possible Value Trap, Think Twice.

While the current price suggests a discount, the insider selling trend could be a red flag that warrants a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and potential headwinds."", ""John McManus's recent sale of 20,000 shares of MGM Resorts International is a significant event that investors should not overlook. While the company's stock appears undervalued based on certain metrics, the consistent pattern of insider selling over the past year raises questions about the insiders' confidence in MGM's future performance. As always, investors should consider insider trading trends as one piece of a larger puzzle when evaluating their investment decisions and perform comprehensive due diligence."", ""Given the mixed signals from valuation metrics and insider activity, a cautious approach is advisable.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Microchip Technology's  ROE today."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microchip Technology is:', '36% = US$2.5b ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.36 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""First thing first, we like that Microchip Technology has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Microchip Technology's considerable five year net income growth of 46% was to be expected."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Microchip Technology's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 30% in the same period, which is great to see."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Microchip Technology is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry."", ""The three-year median payout ratio for Microchip Technology is 39%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 61%. So it seems that Microchip Technology is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered."", ""Additionally, Microchip Technology has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 42%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Microchip Technology's future ROE will be 43% which is again, similar to the current ROE."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Microchip Technology's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

Why Gartner (IT) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170006822.html,1702659606,STORY,['IT'],"['Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock\'s recent trend in either direction. In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Gartner (IT), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Gartner currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if IT is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this technology information and analysis company holds up."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For IT, shares are up 2.46% over the past week while the Zacks Consulting Services industry is up 1.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.07% compares favorably with the industry's 5.4% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Gartner have risen 30.01%, and are up 33.21% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.17% and 19.94%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to IT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. IT is currently averaging 432,279 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with IT."", ""Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost IT's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.28 to $11.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that IT is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Gartner on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield will be 2.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve ', ""We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, Flowserve was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 93.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 23%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.56, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.6% a year over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Flowserve has been growing its earnings per share at 8.6% a year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock."", ""Overall, we think Flowserve is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. The payments look okay by most measures, the lack of cash flow could definitely cause problems for them in the future. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, Flowserve has 2 warning signs (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Higher sales of services and software, and contributions from recent acquisitions bode well for the Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment. Also, improved supply chains and reduced product lead times are supporting Zebra Technologies.Cost-Reduction Actions: ZBRA has announced expanded cost-reduction actions, including an incremental $65 million of annualized expense reductions, as it grapples with a slowdown in end markets and demand softness. Along with the previous cost-reduction actions taken over the past year, the company expects to generate approximately $100 million in cost savings annually.Accretive Acquisition: The company’s expansion initiative is expected to drive growth. Zebra Technologies’ acquisition of Matrox Imaging (June 2022) enabled it to combine its fixed industrial scanning and machine vision portfolio with the latter’s expertise in the imaging market. Zebra Technologies expects approximately a 50-basis point contribution from acquisitions in 2023.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $52 million. While free cash flow was negative in the first half of 2023, the company expects the same to be positive in the second half.

Emergency personnel often have to work in geographically challenging locations where accessibility is limited and connectivity is weak. This is where SmartConnect comes into play as it automatically transitions voice channels to the optimal available communication network, whether on land mobile radio or broadband.SmartConnect allows safety workers' radio systems to utilize in-vehicle LTE or satellite modems for seamless remote access without interruptions. Switchover of the voice communication from one network to another is smooth and fast and does not interrupt the audio and other radio functionalities.NSW SES boasts an extensive pool of 10,000 volunteers dedicated to providing emergency services during challenging events such as road crash, storms, floods, and search and rescue operations. Moreover, 50 public safety agencies and about 50,000 first responders and emergency personnel use the NSW SES public safety network. With the increasing frequency of natural calamities, the public safety entity is actively working to enhance its preparedness by extending the reach and capacity of its radio communication infrastructure.Time sensitivity, proper coordination and clarity of information are vital aspects of any emergency situation. SmartConnect will significantly enhance the resiliency of voice communication in hostile environments. This will facilitate a rapid exchange of information, lower the risk of misinterpretation of crucial details and augment the safety of emergency responders. The system's end-to-end encryption feature meets security requirements throughout the entire process, even during transitions among LMR, LTE, WIFI and satellite networks.As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. The communications equipment maker intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem.The stock has risen 25.1% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 9.3%."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Motorola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

OpenAI's ChatGPT took the world by storm and shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) soared. So how should investors play the sector in 2024? Evercore ISI Head of Internet Research Mark Mahaney and Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst Brent Bracelin give Yahoo Finance Live their best ideas."", 'Mahaney likes Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META). Why? ""They\'ve got so much data to work with and they also have the capital to be able to invest,"" Mahaney explains, adding that these companies were investing in AI long before 2023.', 'Bracelin is favoring Microsoft (MSFT) saying this is Microsoft\'s ""iPhone moment."" Bracelin also likes Adobe (ADBE) and HubSpot (HUBS) for how they plan to monetize their AI products.', 'Watch the video above to find out why Bracelin also thinks database stocks could be a ""dark horse.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""JOSH LIPTON: It is good to see both of you. Mark, let's just pick up right there with AI. And, obviously, Mark, there's been a lot of companies, companies you cover and know really well, that have been putting a lot of time, and effort, and money, Mark, into AI. I'm curious, within your coverage universe, Mark, are there certain companies that are maybe better positioned than others to really benefit from the monetization of generative AI, Mark? Is it Amazon, Alphabet, Meta? How do you see it?"", 'MARK MAHANEY: You just listed the three companies I was going to pitch.', '[LAUGHTER]', ""You stole my thunder, Josh. So it's nice to see you again. And, let's see, yeah, those are the three. Why would those three be the companies? Because they've got so much data to work with, and they've also got the capital to be able to invest, and they have been investing for a decade or seven years in different versions of AI. Amazon's been using machine learning to figure out how to best position packets and parcels within their distribution centers for a long time. We do have a kind of step up in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, there's no doubt about that. I think both as an employer and as a revenue recipient, I actually think Amazon's really interesting."", ""Your second started off highlighting the two companies that everybody refers, to NVIDIA and Microsoft, and then maybe Google get some credit for it. But Amazon usually doesn't show up in the conversation, yet they are the leading cloud vendor, 50% bigger than Azure and our-- Microsoft's Azure. And our point of view all along has been generative AI revolution won't be televised. It won't be on-prem, it's going to be in the cloud."", ""And so when people look for ways to really use these large language models, you're going to need storage capabilities, you're going to need compute capabilities, you're going to need infrastructure, and that's where AWS is 60% market share. So I think Amazon's really kind of the best derivative play off this. Probably I'd put Meta-- I'm sorry, Google 2, and I'd put Meta 3 because I think they've had a wonderful number of applications that people have underappreciated, ways they've used AI. Already improve the experience for both users and advertisers."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Interesting stuff that all of them have a little something for everyone. I want to turn to you, Brent, because sort of the most obvious one in your coverage universe is Microsoft, right? It's been the loudest with their AI, with what's happened with OpenAI. Is that the obvious play here? Or are there others that people should be looking at?"", ""BRENT BRACELIN: Certainly, the obvious play, but for obvious reasons. The way I think about Microsoft, this is their iPhone moment. It was obvious that Apple had an opportunity to capitalize on the iPhone. This is Microsoft's opportunity. Microsoft AI is about a $2 billion business in year 1. We think this is going to be a $10 billion business for Microsoft over the next two years. So we're just in the early stages of the monetization for Microsoft."", ""But that's not the only company in the application space that is leveraging these large language models. Adobe, for example, has done a very good job in a very short period of time monetizing it. There's more stuff coming next year from Adobe. They're coming out with an AI assistant for their Acrobat products and their reader products. So I think there's a lot of interesting things that Adobe is doing, as well as HubSpot, smaller application company, but they're also in a really unique position. They have about 15 different AI features and functions. And they'll be in the early stages of monetizing some of that next year."", 'I would also watch some of the data players. I think outside of the infrastructure as a service players, these database layers could be the dark horse relative to indirect beneficiaries of AI, so MongoDB, Snowflake, these are database layer technologies that actually could see a indirect tailwind as some of these big applications start to get deployed.']"

But, like any stock, Microsoft could fail to deliver good returns for shareholders from here. Let's take a closer look at that bullish thesis and one major fact that could threaten investors' returns."", ""Microsoft's portfolio of software services is becoming more valuable to its customers, which is great news for its long-term growth outlook. It's true that much of this value is coming from the emerging field of AI, a potentially overhyped investing trend on Wall Street these days. Yet Microsoft is getting concrete benefits from AI, such as boosting productivity across areas like cloud enterprise services, cybersecurity, and personal computing."", 'Executives said in a late-October earnings update that the technology is a major factor behind the company\'s recent 23% growth in its cloud segment. Overall revenue rose 12% as its expanding divisions more than offset sluggish results in areas like computing hardware. ""We are rapidly infusing AI across ... every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers,"" CEO Satya Nadella said. Those gains are also directly boosting Microsoft\'s profit margin.', ""Many software-as-a-service companies generate relatively weak earnings, but that's not at all the case for Microsoft. In fact, this tech giant is among the most profitable large companies on the planet."", 'Gross profit last quarter landed at $40 billion, or 71% of sales. Operating income jumped 24% to reach nearly 50% of sales. These gains came despite a relatively tame growth environment and aggressive spending in areas like data centers and research and development.', ""Microsoft's cash flow is stellar, too, with over $30 billion of operating cash generated in just the past three months. As a result, management has the resources it needs to protect the tech titan's dominant market share. The company can also afford to raise the dividend steadily as well."", ""The main issue is that investors have to pay up for exposure to all of these positive factors. Microsoft shares are valued at nearly 13 times sales today, up from a price-to-sales ratio of 9 at the start of the year. An elevated premium like that raises the risk that you'll see underwhelming returns by overpaying for a business. You can own Apple -- which is admittedly less profitable and growing more slowly -- for 8 times revenue."", 'Still, Microsoft checks a lot of boxes as an attractive growth stock investment. With just one stock, you get exposure to multiple promising software niches including cybersecurity and cloud enterprise services. You also gain a big presence in the burgeoning field of generative AI and all the positive implications on the way for software and business productivity.', ""If the stock's price bothers you, consider watching for another pullback in the market or in the tech world.

McDonald’s, meanwhile, has signalled plans to muscle in on Starbucks’ territory with a new chain of “beverage-focused” cafes.', 'Investors are worried. Shares in the chain have dropped more than 7pc over the last month, wiping around $9bn (£7bn) off the value of the company.', 'Narasimhan abandoned Durex-owner Reckitt halfway through a turnaround to join Starbucks, arguing the job was too good to pass up.

McDonald’s says it has plans to open a handful more sites over the months to come.', '“The fact that McDonald’s is doing it and testing it weighs down on investor sentiment because … if McDonald’s gets serious about this, it could start to be a big rival,” says Saunders.', 'Hospitality industry expert Simon Stenning says: “[Starbucks] struggle with their food and now there’s growing competition, certainly on high streets to go somewhere where the food offer is better.”', 'It is not just well-established Western names that are encroaching on Starbucks’ territory. In China – Starbucks’s second-largest market after the US – the chain has found itself struggling to compete against homegrown coffee brand Luckin Coffee.', 'Luckin, which has cheaper prices, overtook Starbucks to become China’s biggest coffee company earlier this year.', '“The growth rates that are coming through from China are nowhere near the levels that Starbucks would perhaps like,” says Saunders. “This big cornerstone of their strategy isn’t quite materialising.”', 'Narasimhan has made cooling tensions with workers his immediate priority, publishing an open letter this week admitting “we do not always get it right”.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Synopsys as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.995. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

An airline spokesperson confirmed to CNN his comments.', 'Last December, a winter storm barreled through the US and disrupted thousands of flights. Although many airlines were able to recover relatively quickly, Southwest didn’t return to normal operations for several days. Crewmembers were left stranded because they were unable to communicate with their dispatchers and schedulers, and the airlines’ legacy technology could not keep up with the rate of changes.', 'Jordan said the airline developed software internally, now being used, that he called “a game changer.” The Dallas-based airline is investing $1.3 billion on technology projects this year, about 25% more than it spent in 2019, the last full year before the pandemic.', '“What you do today typically is, all airlines, you solve the metal or the aircraft, and then you throw that solution to the crews, and then have to solve the crew routing,” Jordan said about the new software. “A lot of times the metal problem makes the crew problems even harder, so they’ve come up with something that actually solves that together.”', 'The airline is still feeling the affects of last year’s disaster. In October, Southwest said it was bracing for a fine from the US Department of Transportation, however it was “not able to estimate” how much the fine could be.', 'Earlier this year,\xa0Southwest released an “action plan”\xa0to prevent another nightmare.

Then it reported it took another\xa0$325 million hit to revenue\xa0during the first three months of this year due to the spillover effect on ticket sales.', 'Southwest’s holiday debacle caught the ire of\xa0its pilots’ union and Congress.

After decades of consolidation and cutbacks, can air travel be fixed?",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prepare-hellish-travel-holiday-season-170120687.html,1702659680,STORY,['LUV'],"['Flying home from a European vacation last month provided me with an unexpectedly magical—by now almost mythical—experience: an on-time, half-empty, remarkably pleasant flight. I sipped a glass of bubbly and watched the latest John Wick, sprawling across the empty coach seat next to me, before taking a luxuriously roomy nap.', 'I’d almost stopped believing such things could exist. This summer, over several trips for work and vacation and a family wedding, I experienced nearly every example of just how terrible it is to fly these days: In June, vague aircraft “mechanical difficulties,” compounded by staff shortages, grounded me for hours in Toronto. In September, daylong weather delays—made worse by, yep, staff shortages—held me hostage at Chicago’s O’Hare airport. Airports were mobbed, and getting a seat in the overcrowded airport lounges that are supposed to make waiting slightly more bearable resembled the vicious fray of The Hunger Games. And with ticket prices spiking earlier this year, I’d paid a small ransom for the privilege of repeatedly throwing myself into the melee.', 'If you’ve flown during this “hellish” and “nightmare” year for air travel, you’ve probably experienced something similar. Flying has been getting measurably worse for years—we’re paying more fees for smaller seats and increased delays—but with travelers surging back into the post-pandemic skies, the industry’s national breakdown has become impossible to ignore.', 'Flying is now so bad that the U.S. government literally can’t keep up with all the people complaining about it. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation received more than 77,600 official consumer complaints—up 55% from 2021, and more than five times the pre-pandemic levels of 2019—about delays, cancellations, refunds, boarding, baggage, and a whole host of other air travel problems. This year, more than 38,100 consumers filed complaints during the first five months of 2023, according to the Department of Transportation’s monthly Air Travel Consumer Report—but that’s where the data stops. The federal agency says it’s still struggling to work through the flood of complaints it has received from unhappy airline customers since the end of May.', '“It is increasingly clear that consumer complaints are not returning to pre-pandemic levels,” the monthly report says of the data backlog.', 'So it’s not just our imaginations, or a handful of isolated incidents, or individual bad luck. The air travel system really “is so miserable for so many people—and has real downsides for the country,” says Ganesh Sitaraman, author of the new (and perfectly named!) book Why Flying Is Miserable: And How to Fix It. “Everybody has their story.”', 'And everyone is bracing for more of these flying horror stories. The December holiday travel season is ramping up, that annual national stress test of travel infrastructure, and a record-breaking 7.5 million people are predicted to take to the skies this year. Last year a winter storm over Christmas sparked a catastrophic meltdown for Southwest Airlines—canceling nearly 17,000 Southwest flights, stranding some passengers for days, and costing the airline more than $1.1 billion.', 'So as Americans head back to the skies for the holidays, can the post-pandemic airline industry finally get its act together?\xa0Spoiler alert: It’s probably too late for that.', 'Even if the big U.S. airlines manage to avoid a poorly timed snowstorm this year, and knuckle through all the other holiday strains on their stretched operations, the industry is fundamentally broken—thanks to decades of decisions by government policymakers and the airlines themselves, Sitaraman argues. The resulting mess hurts all of us: consumers, workers across the air travel system, and a wide swath of Fortune 500 companies and other businesses, who still rely on airlines to send their employees and other stakeholders around the country and the world.', 'Even the airlines and their investors are dissatisfied with the industry status quo, despite being expected to earn more than $23 billion in global profit this year (more than double the profit forecast in June). Jet fuel costs are eating into revenues, and ticket prices have fallen since the spring as inflation-weary customers pull back on some of the post-COVID vacations and other “revenge travel” spending that fueled this summer’s air travel boom.', 'Still, the airlines are struggling to keep up with consumer demand, thanks to aging equipment and labor shortages. And airline investors aren’t very satisfied with the business, despite its soaring profits: Shares of the Big Four airlines—Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines—are still trading below their pre-COVID levels, as Fortune’s Shawn Tully noted this fall.', 'Meanwhile, slightly smaller airlines are trying to merge their way to bigger-company status—despite new regulatory hurdles from the Biden administration, which is trying to prevent more industry consolidation. This month, as JetBlue argued in a federal trial that the U.S. government shouldn’t block its planned $3.8 billion takeover of budget airline Spirit, Alaska Air announced a $1.9 billion deal for Hawaiian Airlines.', 'Such consolidation is part of what has led to our current woes, argues Sitaraman, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. He traces air travel’s current breakdown back to the 1970s, when Congress passed a law deregulating the airlines—setting off decades of industry consolidation and diminishing services that, he argues, are directly responsible for today’s utter entropy.', 'By 2015, just four major airlines—Delta, American, United, and Southwest—controlled 80% of the U.S. market for air travel. Customers unhappy with one airline’s prices or service had few alternatives, especially for those who live in smaller cities.', 'And then COVID-19 hit. The pandemic ground air travel—and airline profits—to a halt, and sent the companies to Washington to beg for bailouts. As in so many other areas—the cracks in our health care system, our nation’s devastating lack of childcare infrastructure—the pandemic also exposed and exacerbated all of air travel’s long-existing fault lines.', ""“We have a kind of boom-and-bust cycle in the airline industry, where there are years where the airlines do extremely well and make a lot of money. And then you have these big demand shocks where people don't fly for a period of time, like after 9/11 or COVID,” Sitaraman says. “When things are good, the airlines do well, and when things are bad, the people suffer.”"", 'In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, airlines encouraged workers to take buyouts or to retire early; cut service to dozens of smaller airports; and permanently grounded some of their older aircraft. And, predictably, when the pandemic eased and Americans started rushing back to the skies, airlines didn’t have the workers or the capacity to start to meet the demand.', 'They still don’t. Take the widespread staff shortages affecting pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers, airport security agents, and air traffic controllers. Some of these gaps, including the national shortage of government-employed controllers and its destabilizing and dangerous effects on the entire air travel system, are beyond the immediate control of airlines.', 'But some are directly a result of their business decisions: After taking $54 billion in U.S. taxpayer-funded bailouts and agreeing not to lay off workers, airlines still encouraged many to leave voluntarily. Some 10,000 pilots left the field in the three years since the start of the pandemic, according to one analyst estimate. But after the pandemic eased and Americans surged back onto airplanes, carriers haven’t been able to hire back enough workers fast enough. The U.S. will have more than 16,000 annual job openings each for pilots and for flight attendants—for every year through 2032—according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'Experienced pilots have a specialized skill set that requires years to develop and is hard to find at short notice. Even workers whose roles require less training or specialized knowledge, such as baggage handlers, require background checks that can take months to process.', 'One of the most frustrating aspects of my flight delays this summer was the lack of specific information about what caused them. “It started with the weather, and then it all snowballed,” multiple empathetic but eerily on-message employees told me during my O’Hare limbo this September.', 'I started to suspect that these answers were a corporate-mandated talking point, carefully workshopped to avoid taking any company responsibility—or, horrors, having to pay passengers any sort of compensation. (Not that they would: While Canada and the European Union both require airlines to pay passengers for flight delays within the companies’ control, and President Biden has proposed doing so, the United States does not currently mandate such payments.)', 'There was probably some truth in the bare-bones mantra I heard again and again: Climate change is increasing extreme and destructive weather, adding to turbulence in the skies and delays and cancellations on the ground. When you add in widespread staff shortages, reduced capacity, increased demand, and aging aircraft—well, a simple thunderstorm or snowstorm can spark a national meltdown, as Southwest discovered last Christmas.', 'All of this, of course, has the worst impact on already-underserved markets. Despite my travel nightmares this summer, I was relatively lucky—I was just trying to get back to New York City, with its three airports and plenty of daily flights. People who live in smaller cities, which have to rely on fewer flights from an airline’s main “hubs,” have many fewer options. Airlines have reduced service to (and in some cases completely abandoned) cities and regions including Cincinnati, St. Louis, Memphis, Duluth, and dozens of others.', 'These decisions often hurt other businesses and entrepreneurs, who sometimes decamp for bigger, better-served regions, and therefore the cities themselves. For example, airlines cut hundreds of daily flights to Cincinnati in the late 2000s. By 2011, the banana company Chiquita Brands International had moved its headquarters out of Cincinnati to Charlotte, N.C.—causing Ohio to lose a company with about $3 billion in annual revenue at the time. Chiquita’s CEO specifically cited its new city’s greater number of international flights as a reason for the move.', 'As the second part of his book title proclaims, Sitaraman is optimistic that “we can fix” this broken system. He outlines several proposals for how regulators and policymakers could address our current problems, from the extreme and unlikely (such as nationalizing the airlines) to smaller, if still industry-shaking, interventions (requiring every major airline to serve a set of smaller cities, at regulated prices, for example; or requiring carriers to create ""rainy day"" funds that would reduce the need for taxpayer bailouts during the next crisis). The ultimate goal, he argues, should be to create an air travel system that serves the whole country, with no bailouts or bankruptcies and more transparent pricing.', 'It is worth noting that Sitaraman is a former longtime advisor to progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so his recommendations are likely to be met with skepticism, at best, in the business community. And any big policy fix to this decades-in-development problem will have to survive a dysfunctional and highly partisan Washington that’s entering a contentious presidential election cycle—one in which any sort of call for stronger regulations is likely to be painted as automatically antibusiness. (The airline industry’s lobby is already resisting President Biden’s attempt to crack down on “junk fees,” including the $6.7 billion in baggage fees airlines collected last year, the Washington Post reported last month.)', 'But however skeptical the broader business community may be about his proposals, Sitaraman argues that reregulating the airline industry isn’t a partisan issue—or an antibusiness one. After all, both Republicans and Democrats live in places that coastal elites dismiss as “flyover country.” And businesses as well as consumers are hurt by the airlines’ shrinking ability to ferry their employees and customers around the country efficiently.', ""“Who wants to start a Fortune 500 company in a city that doesn't have an airport, or that doesn't have much airline service?” Sitaraman says. “That's a real downside for economic growth and vibrancy and opportunity in lots of different places.”"", ""So he's optimistic that we really can fix flying eventually. But in the meantime, I’m not pressing my luck for Christmas. I’m taking the train."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

They are the stocks of the companies that are involved in businesses like alcohol, tobacco, gambling, adult entertainment, weapons manufacturing, and cannabis. It is important to keep in mind that this idea could be subjective. For example, while a lot of people consider cannabis a harmful drug, others consider it beneficial, especially medical marijuana.', 'Sin stocks are quite popular among investors because of their potential for strong financial performance, including dividends and capital appreciation. Some sin stocks have even performed better than the defensive consumer staples sector over the last three rough economic years. After the stock markets around the globe crashed in February 2020, many stocks and ETFs hit their lowest on March 20, 2020. Some of them included Constellation Brands, Inc.

The inelastic demand of sin stock consumers makes them one of the best recession-proof investments.', 'It is commonly believed that sin stocks are usually avoided by institutions, and in turn, it negatively affects these companies. However, a Columbia Business School report suggests that it is not entirely true. The research mentions a research paper by Shivaram Rajgopal, the Kester and Byrnes Professor of Accounting at Columbia Business School, and his co-authors, Robert Eccles, visiting professor at Oxford University, and Jing Xie, assistant professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. According to their research, their investigation initially found that institutions generally have less equity in such companies. However, the trend mostly faded away when they adjusted for variations in key fundamentals such as historical performance and investment in research and development between sin and non-sin stocks. In conclusion, the word “sin” matters less to institutions than weaker or riskier fundamentals. Shivaram Rajgopal said:', '“Regardless of the stigma associated with sin stocks, institutions would probably be expected to hold more of, say, profitable firms, larger firms, firms with better past performance, and so on.”', 'CNN reports that the number of cigarette smokers in the USA declined from 50% of the adult population in the 1940s to 12.5% by 2021.

Between 1968 and 2015, the company rose 20% annually. Nevertheless, the company stock has seen price and revenue declines over the last few years due to the declining number of smokers.', 'Despite the numbers, our previous article reported that the global tobacco market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1% between 2023 and 2030.

In addition, e-cigarettes are also expected to rise in demand and experience a CAGR of 4.4% between 2023 and 2028.', 'Moreover, big tobacco companies have also been investing heavily in the cannabis industry, a market that is expected to grow by $46.90 billion between 2022 and 2027, registering a CAGR of 24.03%.

Western Union was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth."", ""Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 14.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 57%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.50 total annually to $0.94. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.5% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Western Union has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.9% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. We don't think Western Union is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Spirit provides property damage, business interruption, construction all risks, excess liability and employee medical reimbursement insurance for Phillips 66, its affiliates and subsidiaries’ domestic U.S. operations only; however, Spirit generally does not provide coverage for Texas-based risks. Radius provides similar coverage (i.e., property damage, business interruption, excess liability) to Phillips 66, its affiliate and subsidiaries’ non-U.S. risks in which Phillips 66 has ownership interests. However, premium and exposures for Radius declined in 2022 after removing U.K. property exposures from the captive.', 'Spirit and Radius have exposure to low frequency, high severity loss claims due to the sizable limits offered on their respective policies, introducing potential significant dependence on reinsurance protection.

The analyst also said that risks in the market could fuel gold price in 2024 as investors flock to gold for hedging against inflation and risks. Emons cited the upcoming election and possibility of recession as catalysts for gold price in 2024.', 'The Netherlands-based financial services company ING Group also said in a report that gold’s rally seen in 2023 fueled by geopolitical risks and uncertainties is expected to continue in 2024.

ING said its economists expect the Federal Reserve to begin slashing interest rates in May 2024. They are expecting 150bp of rate cuts next year in total, with a further 100bp in early 2025. The ING report said these rate cuts would support gold in 2024.', 'We believe gold prices will be supported going into 2024 amid a weaker US dollar on the back of US monetary easing. The risk of tensions escalating in the Middle East should also provide support to the precious metal. We expect gold prices to hit fresh highs next year and to average $2,100/z in 4Q, with a 2024 average of $2,031/oz on the assumption that the Fed starts cutting rates in the second quarter of next year, the dollar weakens, safe-haven demand continues amid global economic uncertainty and central bank buying remains at high levels.

Despite this impressive jump, the current price remains below the 52-week peak of nearly $24 per share and is well short of its five-year high of $31.30 per share.

The company's ownership of these stores is diverse: it wholly owns 316 locations, leases 361 and possesses 102 properties, where it owns the building but leases the land."", ""At the start of 2016, Starboard estimated Macy's entire real estate holdings to be worth approximately $21 billion. The crown jewel of Macy's properties is its flagship store, the historic Herald Square building in New York City, dating back to 1902. This iconic building, covering over 2.17 million square feet, was appraised by Starboard at nearly $1,830 per square foot, valuing it close to $4 billion. However, since then, its property ownership dynamics have shifted significantly, with a decreased number of owned stores and increased leased properties. If we apply a conservative 50% discount to Starboard's valuation, Macy's real estate portfolio is estimated to be around $10.5 billion. With approximately 278 million shares, the retailer's real estate portfolio alone could be worth $38 per share."", ""Source: Starboard's presentation"", ""In the retail sector, physical stores face challenges while online shopping continues to experience significant growth. Macy's financial performance reflects this trend, with revenue and net income declining over the years. In 2014, the company achieved nearly $28 billion in revenue and a net income of approximately $1.49 billion. However, by 2022, these figures had dropped to $25.3 billion in revenue and just $1.18 billion in net income. The most challenging year was 2021, when revenue plummeted to $18.1 billion and the company suffered a substantial net loss of nearly $4 billion."", ""Despite the 2022 net income being only 20% lower than in 2014, Macy's market capitalization has suffered a drastic decline. It has plummeted by 70%, from $20 billion to just $5.7 billion, aligning closely with the recent buyout offer valuation proposed for the company."", ""Since 2014, Macy's was perceived as undervalued, a view that led Starboard Value to initiate a position in the company. Assuming the valuation in 2014 was accurate and reflective of the business's true worth, a proportional response to the 20% decrease in net income would suggest the market capitalization should have experienced a similar decline of 20%. This would result in a revised market capitalization of approximately $16 billion rather than the more dramatic drop that actually happened."", 'Source: YCharts', ""Macy's financials demonstrate a solid balance sheet. As of the third quarter, its total assets amounted to $18.1 billion, encompassing $4.14 billion in shareholders' equity. The company holds a significant debt profile, with nearly $3 billion in long-term debt, $160 million in short-term debt and about $3 billion in long-term lease liabilities. Nevertheless, the presence of $6 billion in inventory and $5.8 billion in property and equipment positions the company favorably in terms of financial stability."", ""Up until 2017, Macy's, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shared similar price-earnings multiples. However, since 2018, a divergence has occurred. Walmart's multiple soared, while Macy's experienced a gradual decline and Target maintained a middle ground."", 'Source: YCharts', ""The recent buyout offer values Macy's at just 8 times earnings, significantly lower than its peers. Walmart, with bigger size and stronger operational performance, commands the highest earnings multiple at 25. Target, meanwhile, is valued higher than Macy's but lower than Walmart at 17.3 times."", ""For the 2023 fiscal year, Macy's projects its revenue to be in the range of $22.9 billion to $23.2 billion, indicating a further decrease of 6% to 7% from 2022. The forecasted annual adjusted earnings per share range from $2.88 to $3.13. Should Macy's achieve earnings of $3 per share, applying a modest 12 times earnings multiple, which remains the lowest among these retail giants, would price its stock at around $36 per share."", ""I think the buyout offer for Macy's at $21 per share significantly undervalues its true worth. Despite facing challenges of the retail sector, such as the shift toward online shopping and fluctuating revenue figures, the company's assets and balance sheet remain strong."", ""The valuation disparity becomes more evident when comparing Macy's earnings multiples with its peers. Both the real estate portfolio valuation and the retail business operations suggest its intrinsic value is in the range of $36 to $38 per share. Therefore, shareholders and potential investors should consider the underlying value of the company, not just in its current market performance, but also in its intrinsic assets and future potential. While attractive at a glance, the current buyout offer may not fully capture the enduring value and resilience of this iconic retail institution."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This is what Nordstrom executives (many of them also family members) probably had in mind when they attempted to take the business private several years ago.', ""“That's a different story — taking it private so that they’re not being scrutinized by Wall Street,” Ramírez said by phone. “The real estate is very interesting because Macy's does own a lot, and they previously have sold, which has helped to some extent. But if they were to be taken private, in the best case scenario, it should be someone who also has an interest in retail, in order to propel forward. It would be a huge overhaul because there are so many problems.”"", 'Macy’s declined to comment for this story.', 'In recent years, Macy’s sold its San Francisco men’s store\xa0for $250 million, its Minneapolis flagship for $59 million, a portion of its Chicago Loop flagship\xa0for $27 million and its Pittsburgh flagship for $15 million.', 'As of January, the company owns 316 stores, another 102 where it owns the buildings but not the land, and four that are part-owned, according to its most recent annual report. All owned properties are held free and clear of mortgages, per that report, which means the company owns more than 58% of its 722 store locations. Various analysts peg the value of Macy’s real estate at $5 billion to $7 billion, with its Herald Square flagship in New York possibly able to fetch over $1 billion.', 'But once any property is sold, any Macy’s stores that stay open would face rent obligations equivalent to long-term debt, according to Chuck Fancher, principal at Fancher Partners, a retail and mixed-use real estate development and acquisition firm.', '“That cash flow obligation is something that they cannot forestall or ignore,” he said by phone. “When the retailer is experiencing variable revenue streams, when their sales are down, when they have inordinate costs, like shipping, shrink and other things, fixed costs like debt or rent makes their cash business harder to manage.”', 'Similar moves at other companies are casting a shadow over what most analysts see as purely a real estate play, which could even include a sale of the New York City flagship. Conglomerate HBC, which owns Hudson’s Bay Co., Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th, has monetized its holdings’ e-commerce as well as their real estate, to the detriment of their retail operations, according to retail consultant Doug Stephens, who said by phone that the setup should serve as a warning to Macy’s.', 'The story at Sears is even darker. In 2015, after a hedge fund run by Eddie Lampert acquired Sears and Kmart, the retailers spun off their property into a real estate investment trust dubbed Seritage Growth Properties, including 235 Sears and Kmart stores. At least one of Macy’s would-be suitors, Arkhouse Management, specializes in unlocking “unrealized equity value caused by the mispricing of real estate assets in the public market,” per its website.', '“This created a long-term rent obligation that, at least at market rates, were not favorable. As volumes declined, costs did not proportionately decline, and it got to the point where it became unsustainable,” Fancher said of Sears. “Converting all of that real estate into debt may have given Eddie or the company a cash reprieve, but it ultimately became too much weight in the long run for the operating company.”', 'The value of Macy’s real estate sticks out because its retail operations have been in decline for years, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.', '“Macy’s struggles with the fundamentals of retailing and its recent sales performance underlines that it continues to lose market share and relevance in an increasingly competitive market,” he said in emailed comments. “Correcting years of missteps will be expensive and risky for anyone acquiring the business at a premium.”', 'The tension comes as Macy’s faces the need for a turnaround that could mean closing many more mall anchors than envisioned by outgoing CEO Jeff Gennette. In January, he announced that the closures of four full-line Macy’s stores signaled “the final stretch” of a fleet reduction that since 2016 entailed shuttering some 170 locations. But to remain viable, Macy’s will probably need to close hundreds more, according to Nick Egelanian, president of retail development firm SiteWorks.', ""“Macy’s has a future as a much smaller chain, operating in the 150 malls that survive,” he said by phone. “That could include a flagship store in New York. That means, if they spin the property off, the retail business has to be given enough capital to fix itself. There is a retail play, there is a future for Macy’s. But my guess is that they have not figured that out, and they're just looking at a real estate play. That they're not thinking retail —\xa0they’re thinking liquidation.”"", 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

The research mentions a research paper by Shivaram Rajgopal, the Kester and Byrnes Professor of Accounting at Columbia Business School, and his co-authors, Robert Eccles, visiting professor at Oxford University, and Jing Xie, assistant professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. According to their research, their investigation initially found that institutions generally have less equity in such companies. However, the trend mostly faded away when they adjusted for variations in key fundamentals such as historical performance and investment in research and development between sin and non-sin stocks. In conclusion, the word “sin” matters less to institutions than weaker or riskier fundamentals. Shivaram Rajgopal said:', '“Regardless of the stigma associated with sin stocks, institutions would probably be expected to hold more of, say, profitable firms, larger firms, firms with better past performance, and so on.”', 'CNN reports that the number of cigarette smokers in the USA declined from 50% of the adult population in the 1940s to 12.5% by 2021.

In addition, e-cigarettes are also expected to rise in demand and experience a CAGR of 4.4% between 2023 and 2028.', 'Moreover, big tobacco companies have also been investing heavily in the cannabis industry, a market that is expected to grow by $46.90 billion between 2022 and 2027, registering a CAGR of 24.03%.

Rising interest rates and falling commodity prices weighed on the industry. While the S&P 500 has rallied more than 20% this year, energy stocks in that index are down by more than 3% on average.', ""However, while last year was a down year for the energy sector, 2024 could be a bounce-back year. Because of that, energy stocks could deliver strong total returns. NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the best ones to buy heading into 2024. Here's why they think these energy stocks could put a charge in your portfolio next year."", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): Looking at the energy sector from a broad perspective it includes boring utility stocks. But there's one utility stock that has proven it is anything but boring, at least on the dividend front, and that's NextEra Energy. This industry giant, with a market cap of $122 billion, has increased its dividend annually for 29 years and at a compound annual rate of 10% over the past decade. Those would be impressive stats for any company, let alone a utility."", ""The key to NextEra's success is that it is really two companies in one. The foundation is NextEra's regulated utility operations, which largely consists of Florida Power & Light. This is a slow and steady performer benefiting from operating in a state that's seen steady population growth. Regulated assets have monopolies in the areas they serve but must get the rates they charge and their investment plans approved by the government. While this generally leads to slow growth, that growth is fairly dependable regardless of the market environment."", ""On top of this slow and steady business, NextEra has built one of the world's largest clean energy companies. This business is expected to keep growing for years as the world shifts toward renewable power. To provide some scale to the opportunity, NextEra's renewable power business has 34 gigawatts of capacity today with plans to increase that by as much as 41 gigawatts by 2026."", 'At this point, management expects to increase the dividend by 10% at least until 2024 with earnings growth of between 6% and 8% a year expected through at least 2026. Meanwhile, the dividend yield is historically high today at 3.1%, suggesting the stock is on sale.', ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Despite regaining some ground in recent weeks, shares of Brookfield Renewable have hugely underperformed the market in 2023. Rising interest rates are largely to blame as they can hinder plans for companies like Brookfield Renewable that bank on cheap debt to fund growth. The market's fears were exacerbated when Brookfield's peer NextEra Energy Partners slashed its growth targets in September, citing funding challenges in a high interest rate environment."", ""Yet, Brookfield Renewable hasn't stopped growing, and the drop in the renewable energy stock's price makes it an enticing energy stock now. In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Brookfield's funds from operations (FFO) grew 7.7% year over year. Management didn't mince words, stating that it wasn't pleased to see its share price fall. Management's outlook for the business, however, is better than ever, and it remains focused on long-term growth."", 'It also sees plenty of opportunities to deploy capital at or above its target returns as demand for clean energy continues to rise even as several market participants find it harder to access capital amid high interest rates. In other words, Brookfield Renewable may not cut back on its growth spending in the near term, contrary to what the market fears.', 'Driven primarily by its development pipeline and acquisitions, Brookfield Renewable grew its FFO per unit by 10% annually over the past decade and is targeting a similar 10% or more annual FFO growth rate through 2028. It also expects to increase its dividend by 5% to 9% annually, hoping to deliver 12% to 15% total returns to shareholders. With Brookfield Renewable shares yielding 5%, investors who buy the stock now can expect strong returns in the long term.', ""Matt DiLallo (Kinder Morgan): Kinder Morgan's energy infrastructure business generates very stable cash flow. The company gets two-thirds of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts and commodity-priced hedges, which lock in its cash flow. Meanwhile, another 26% is fee-based earnings with no commodity price exposure. That gives Kinder Morgan lots of visibility into its cash flow. "", ""The pipeline giant expects to produce about $5 billion, or $2.21 per share, of distributable cash flow next year. That's 5% above what it anticipates producing this year. That predictability gave Kinder Morgan the confidence to increase its already high-yielding dividend (recently 6.4%) by another 1.8% for next year, extending its streak to seven straight years of dividend growth. "", ""While its contracts lock in most of its cash flow, the company has lots of upside potential. Its current financial expectations don't include any impact from STX Midstream. The company recently agreed to buy the natural gas pipeline operation from NextEra Energy Partners in a $1.8 billion deal. It anticipates that the transaction will be accretive to its cash flow in 2024 and beyond. "", 'Meanwhile, it has a lot of financial flexibility even after completing that sizable transaction, which should close in the first quarter of next year. Kinder Morgan is currently on track to end 2024 with a 3.8 times leverage ratio, well below its 4.5 times target. While the company will use some of its financial capacity to close the STX Midstream deal, the transaction will only increase its leverage ratio by 0.1 times next year while being leverage-neutral over the long term. ', 'That gives Kinder Morgan lots of financial flexibility heading into 2024. It can opportunistically deploy that capacity on share repurchases, value-enhancing acquisitions like STX Midstream, and sanctioning additional high-return organic expansion projects. Future capital deployment could further boost its cash flow per share, giving Kinder Morgan more fuel to grow its dividend.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?"", ""Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about NextEra Energy (NEE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage."", 'NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.73 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 6.7% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEE', 'Check price target & stock forecast for NextEra here>>>The ABR suggests buying NextEra, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is NEE Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.12.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>"", 'It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Shares of JPMorgan have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+29.8% vs. +17.7%). High interest rates, buyouts, global expansion efforts and decent loan demand will aid net interest income (NII), though rising funding costs will weigh on it.According to the Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 9.8% and 7.2%, respectively, by 2025. Aided by solid earnings strength and balance sheet, it will be able to sustain capital distributions. Despite visibility of some greenshoots in the investment banking (IB) business, IB fees are less likely to improve soon.This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates, will likely hamper fee income growth. Owing to these challenges, we expect total non-interest income (managed) to witness a CAGR of just 3.6% by 2025. Mounting costs are a woe and we expect it to rise 11% in 2023.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)Abbott shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+2.1% vs. -0.1%). The company is strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for advanced medical technologies. Within the EPD business, which is solely based in emerging markets, the Zacks analyst expects Abbott to register a sales CAGR of nearly 6% through fiscal 2025.Within Core Diagnostics, Abbott is gaining market share following the end of the public health emergency, particularly in the United States and Europe region. Within Diabetes Care, Abbott is scaling up the production of Libre and gaining reimbursement approval in several countries. Innovations and market expansion efforts are helping it offset the impact of inflation and supply disruptions.However, a steep year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales hurt growth. Further, the decision to exit the pediatric nutrition business in China continue to impede overall growth in Nutrition.(You can read the full research report on Abbott here >>>)Shares of Qualcomm have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +9.2%). The company is well poised to benefit from solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. Strength in the snapdragon portfolio is an additional tailwind as exemplified by the multi-year.Apple deal for 5G modems for iPhones. It is focusing on a seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid momentum in IoT.However, it reported relatively soft fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and soft recovery in China, resulting in lower-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels.Weakness in the smartphone industry and cautious client approach are weighing on margins.

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide non-recurring engineering efforts in support of bringing eight MH-60R aircraft from a standard Foreign Military Sales (FMS) configuration to a unique configuration for the government of Spain.', 'Through this modification, Lockheed will also procure eight embedded global positioning system inertial navigation systems spares, four airborne low-frequency sonars and production spares, and provide associated field service representative support for the MH-60R helicopter.', 'A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Owego, NY; Stratford, CT; and Brest, France.', 'Nations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, military helicopters that play a critical role in military missions have also witnessed a significant rise in demand.To this end, it is imperative to mention that U.S. military helicopters have gained prominence and significant traction lately due to advancements and integration of new tactical, logistical and other important features. Lockheed, being a prominent helicopter manufacturer, thus wins frequent contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies for its combat-proven helicopter programs like the MH-60R Seahawk.Notably, MH-60R brings transformational anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities to navies around the world.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Baxter International:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.073 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$31b - US$6.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Baxter International has an ROCE of 7.3%.

Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 7.3% from 12% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Baxter International is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has declined 33% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either.

The FDA has specifically cleared Welireg for use in kidney cancer patients after they’ve received an immunotherapy, like Merck’s Keytruda, and a type of targeted medicine.', 'The approval was granted quickly, only months after Merck in August reported positive interim results from a pivotal trial.\xa0Yet there are questions about the benefits Welireg provides. At a medical meeting in October, Merck revealed that, while Welireg’s response rates and effects on cancer progression had widened, it hasn’t provided a survival benefit. That finding has led some oncologists to question its value.', 'Its impact on cancer’s march has also been modest, with study results showing it helped patients live a median of 5.6 months before their disease got worse or death, comparable to everolimus. The 25% relative risk reduction measured for Welireg over everolimus is the result of delayed progression in patients who surpassed the 5.6-month median, according to the drug’s prescribing information.', 'Still, the drug will fill a gap, as it’s the first specifically approved for its particular patient group. It’s also provided a blueprint for others in development.

But the next decade for this large regulated U.S. utility is likely to look very different from the last one.', 'That is good for dividend investors, with management spelling out a pretty clear target for the positive changes it sees ahead.', ""Southern has increased its dividend annually for 22 consecutive years. But that's just the start of the dividend record here, since it has held steady or increased for a full 76 years."", ""That's a stat that even the most conservative dividend investor will find appealing. It highlights a commitment to returning value to investors via a growing dividend that few other companies can match."", 'Notably, the utility has supported the dividend through good periods and bad. That includes the Great Recession, the coronavirus pandemic, and even the dramatic inflation uptick during the 1970s.', ""Southern is the kind of dividend stock that you buy as a foundation to a more broadly diversified portfolio. You don't expect it to be exciting, but you do expect it to be reliable."", ""Only over the past decade, this utility has been a bit of a laggard on the dividend front in an important way. The payout growth over that span has averaged only around 3% a year. In fairness, that's roughly enough to keep up with the historical rate of inflation growth over time. So the buying power of Southern's dividends hasn't declined, which is good. But investors generally hope for a little more."", ""So, all in, there's a lot to like about Southern's dividend even though there's one notable issue to complain about. That little niggle is about to change."", 'The big headwind for the utility over the past decade that has forced it to limit dividend growth is the Vogtle project. It includes two large-scale nuclear power plants, and it has been over budget and delayed multiple times.', ""To suggest that the construction process didn't go well would be an understatement; the original contractor declared bankruptcy (forcing Southern to take on that role), and it had to contend with the disruptions caused by a global pandemic."", ""That's the bad news, and it was the main reason Southern rode the brake on dividend growth, keeping it slow and steady. But the first of the two power plants is now attached to the grid, and the second one should be up and running in early 2024."", ""The utility estimates that the two plants, once fully operational, will add as much as $700 million to the company's cash flow from operations. There's a dual benefit, since the capital spending associated with Vogtle will go away and the power plants will start generating revenue."", 'That cash will be used in a few ways. Debt reduction and investment in other capital projects will be the first orders of business. But according to management, once the company lowers the payout ratio below 70%, dividend growth that aligns more closely with earnings growth is the target.', ""Right now, the payout ratio is projected by management to be around 77%, so don't expect an uptick in dividend growth in 2024. However, 2025 seems like a real possibility, with the payout ratio being the prime figure to monitor along the way."", ""As the chart above shows, shares of Southern have largely bucked the broader downtrend in the utility sector, using the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy. That's likely because Wall Street was so down on the stock while it was muddling through the Vogtle project. Now that the project is nearly complete, investors are increasingly positive. It isn't the bargain it once was."", 'That said, if you have owned Southern through this difficult construction project, you are being rewarded for your patience today. And the reward looks likely to get even better when dividend growth moves out of the moribund range it has been stuck in for so long.', ""Meanwhile, if you don't own the utility and have a dividend growth mindset, you might want to put it on your radar screen. Management has provided a target (a sub-70% payout ratio) for when the dividend story should change in a very positive direction."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Southern Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Southern Company, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Southern Company wasn't one of them.

After all, many investors are on vacation and take a break from buying and selling stocks. Interestingly, though, the S&P 500 often rises noticeably in the final five trading days of December and the first two days in January.', 'Three Motley Fool contributors think they\'ve identified fantastic stocks that are especially likely to enjoy this kind of ""Santa Claus rally."" Here\'s why they picked AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).', ""Keith Speights (AbbVie): We won't have to wait until after Christmas for one beaten-down stock to rally. The rally has already begun for AbbVie: Shares of the big drugmaker have jumped more than 10% since Thanksgiving. I think this momentum could continue into the new year."", ""Two big business-development deals appear to have renewed investors' interest in AbbVie. On Nov. 30, the company announced plans to buy ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion. A week later, AbbVie revealed that it intends to acquire Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion. Both transactions appear to be smart moves that will bolster AbbVie's pipeline and, in the case of ImmunoGen, add an approved cancer therapy with fast-growing sales to its lineup."", ""Speaking of cancer therapies, investors also have a reason to be optimistic about AbbVie's epcoritamab. The drugmaker recently announced positive results for the experimental bispecific antibody in a phase 1/2 study for treating relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The therapy has already been approved in both the United States and the European Union in treating certain types of large B-cell lymphoma. Analysts project that epcoritamab could generate peak annual sales of close to $3 billion."", ""I also think that the increasing prospects of interest-rate cuts next year could entice some income investors to shift money into AbbVie stock. Lower rates will cause bond yields to fall, but could provide a catalyst for stocks. AbbVie's current dividend yield of 4% and its status as a Dividend King could be a winning combination for income investors seeking better alternatives to bonds."", 'Prosper Junior Bakiny (CRISPR Therapeutics): The past few weeks have been eventful for CRISPR Therapeutics. The most crucial development for the company is that it finally earned approval for gene-editing therapy Casgevy as a treatment for sickle cell disease in the U.S. and the U.K., and for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) in the U.K. A U.S. approval decision on the TDT indication is expected by March 30, 2024.', ""However, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares have been falling, probably partly because some investors decided to take their profits now that the biotech has achieved this important milestone. So why think CRISPR Therapeutics could profit from a Santa Claus rally?"", ""These things are always hard to predict, but the feat the company just accomplished is nothing to sneeze at. It earned the world's first approval for a CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment -- a technique that recently won its creators a Nobel prize."", ""Furthermore, with a price tag of $2.2 million in the U.S., Casgevy's total addressable market is massive. Even with just the 32,000 patients it plans to target together with its partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), it comes out to a total of a little over $70 billion. That's before we consider that CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex could target far more patients if given label expansions. Casgevy's peak sales probably won't come anywhere close to matching its full market opportunity, but they don't have to for CRISPR Therapeutics to be a big winner."", ""While it isn't surprising to see some investors jump on the opportunity to take some profits, others might soon decide to initiate positions given how promising CRISPR Therapeutics' prospects just became. This could be just the first of many approvals for breakthrough gene-editing therapies for the biotech."", ""That's why a Santa Claus rally could be in the cards for CRISPR Therapeutics. More importantly, long-term investors should stick with the stock regardless of what transpires in the next two weeks."", ""David Jagielski (Pfizer): One underrated stock that investors have been dumping this year is Pfizer. The healthcare giant is on track to generate up to $61 billion in revenue this year -- more than it brought in before the pandemic. It's been busy loading up on acquisitions to bolster its growth prospects, but investors can't get past looming patent cliffs and the steep declines in COVID-related revenue this year."", ""While those are valid concerns, the stock should be trading at higher levels than it is now. If you ignore the brief market crash of 2020 when investors went into a panic about the coronavirus, then Pfizer's stock would be trading at near-seven-year lows right now."", ""But Pfizer's business isn't in peril the way it would have to be to justify the massive sell-off the stock has seen this year. Down 44%, it's trading at just 9 times forward earnings while the S&P 500 averages a multiple of 20."", ""The company has multiple growth catalysts it can tap into. CEO Albert Bourla has a plan to add $25 billion to the company's top line by 2030, through acquisitions and in-house drug development, to offset declines from patent cliffs and diminishing demand for COVID-related products."", 'Pfizer is coming off a tough quarter in which it reported a net loss of $2.4 billion for the period ending Oct. 1. But the big drugmaker is trimming costs and plans to shave $3.5 billion in annual expenses as it scales down its COVID operations.', 'Overall, I think this is still a top stock to own. Its valuation is attractive, and the dividend yield currently stands at 5.7%. Pfizer just might be ripe for the picking in a Santa Claus rally, as value investors recognize the great bargain offered by the stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

As of this writing, the shares are 80% off that all-time high."", 'Despite this poor performance, this payments and fintech giant is still a smart stock to buy, especially on the dip. But investors should heed one warning sign.', ""I think there are many reasons to like PayPal. By operating a two-sided platform, with 35 million merchants and 393 million individual accounts, this business benefits from network effects. The greater the adoption PayPal gets from both user groups, the more valuable the platform becomes because there's higher utility. This is what makes up the company's economic moat."", ""The stock's performance doesn't show it, but this is an extremely profitable enterprise.

And it looks like a smart investment to make right now."", ""However, astute investors are always concerned about any risk factors. In PayPal's case, we can't ignore how incredibly competitive the payments landscape has become."", ""This shouldn't be surprising. PayPal has long been at the forefront of the rise of digital payments. And this has been the case both for consumers and merchants. This success, though, attracted an army of competitors."", ""On the merchant side, PayPal competes in a variety of areas, like fees, fraud minimization, authorization rates, and the customer experience. From a merchant's perspective, there are a lot of service providers to choose from that go up against PayPal's Braintree. Privately held Stripe, Shopify, and Adyen are formidable opponents, all posing challenges to PayPal."", 'Consumers probably care most about ease of use and ubiquitous acceptance.

All three major stock indexes have rallied strongly from their 2022 bear market lows, with the growth stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) leading the charge. Through the closing bell on Dec. 13, the Nasdaq was higher by 41% for the year."", ""Yet in spite of this massive return, Wall Street's favorite innovation-powered index remains 8% below its all-time closing high, set a little over two years ago. Though some traders are bound to view this as a lost period for growth stocks, long-term investors will wisely see this decline as an opportunity to build their stakes in fast-growing, high-quality businesses at a discount."", ""What follows are four unequaled growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip."", 'The first head-of-its-class stock to confidently add to your portfolio with the Nasdaq still well off of its all-time high is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the company behind internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.', ""The reason Alphabet stock isn't at an all-time high has to do with recessionary concerns. Alphabet generated almost 78% of its sales from advertising during the September-ended quarter. With a handful of money-based metrics suggesting an economic downturn is on the horizon, there's the very clear worry that ad spending will slow."", 'However, this is a two-sided coin for Alphabet, and it very much favors the patient. While recessions are inevitable, they tend to be short-lived. Only three of the 12 recessions following World War II lasted at least 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months. Despite being cyclical, ad-driven businesses benefit from long-winded economic expansions.', ""For more than a decade, Google has been Alphabet's foundational operating segment. As of November, it accounted for 91.54% of worldwide internet search share, according to GlobalStats. In fact, Google has been responsible for at least 90% of monthly internet search share dating back to the first quarter of 2015. This is going to remain a cash-cow segment for a long time to come."", ""From a growth perspective, what's really exciting for Alphabet is its cloud infrastructure service operations. Following years of losses, Google Cloud, the global No. 3 for cloud infrastructure service spending, has delivered three consecutive quarterly profits. Cloud margins are considerably higher than advertising margins, which clears a path for this segment to potentially become Alphabet's key driver of cash flow."", ""Despite a strong rally for Alphabet's stock in 2023, it remains historically inexpensive."", ""A second unequaled growth stock you'll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market drop is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)."", ""It's no secret why Okta's stock has been under pressure in recent weeks. In late September, the company was the target of hackers who breached its support systems and stole sensitive information. Okta confirmed in late November that all of its clients were affected. Though this could cost the identity verification solutions provider some customers in the very short-term, both Okta's platform and the dynamics of the cybersecurity industry are working in its favor."", ""With regard to the latter, businesses with an online or cloud-based presence don't have the luxury of choosing to go unprotected. Hackers and robots don't take time off when it comes to trying to steal enterprise and consumer data. As the movement of data into the cloud has accelerated, reliance on third-party providers like Okta has become even more pronounced."", 'Though Okta\'s platform was breached by hackers, it\'s only going to grow more efficient and effective over time. Okta\'s platform is cloud-native and reliant on artificial intelligence and machine learning to ""evolve"" and spot potential threats. Identity verification is an $80 billion addressable market that\'s still in its relative infancy.', ""The other key growth driver for Okta is its acquisition of Auth0, which was completed in February 2022. Despite higher-than-expected integration costs, this buyout is a building block for the company. It vastly expands the combined companies' opportunity in customer identity (a $30 billion addressable market), and meaningfully grows Okta's sales potential beyond the borders of the U.S. In other words, it should allow Okta to comfortably sustain a double-digit growth rate."", ""The third supercharged growth stock that's begging to be bought following the Nasdaq bear market decline is China-based internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)."", ""China stocks have had a rough couple of years. The world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product struggled through three years of stringent COVID-19 lockdowns that crippled supply chains and capped consumer demand for goods and services. Even with these restrictions now lifted, it's taking time for the previously fast-growing Chinese economy to regain its swagger."", ""On the other hand, the same macro premise I described with Alphabet holds true with Baidu. Economic downturns tend to be short-lived, while periods of expansion can go on for years. It also doesn't hurt that China has consistently grown at a faster pace than most developed countries. With a burgeoning middle class, there's plenty of reason to be excited about high-growth China stocks if you're a long-term-minded investor."", ""Like Alphabet, Baidu has a veritable stranglehold on internet search market share. In November, it accounted for nearly 69% of search share for the world's No. 2 economy. With few exceptions, it's held a 60% to 85% search share in China over the past nine years. This makes it the logical go-to for advertisers and should afford the company exceptional ad-pricing power."", ""Baidu's AI-driven ventures are, arguably, even more compelling from an investment standpoint. Baidu is one of China's leading cloud-service providers, and Apollo Go is one of the world's top autonomous ride-hailing platforms. Baidu's non-online marketing segment has pretty consistently outpaced the growth of its search-driven segment."", 'At roughly 10 times forward-year earnings, Baidu is dirt cheap and ripe for the picking.', ""A fourth unequaled growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is fintech company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL)."", ""An above-average inflation rate and the noted prospect of a U.S. recession have both worked against PayPal's stock over the past two years. Higher inflation threatens to reduce the purchasing power of low-earning workers, while recessions are known for declines in consumer and enterprise purchases. Since PayPal is predominantly a transaction-focused platform, fewer transactions would lead to a decline in gross profit for the company."", ""However, these fears haven't come to fruition. PayPal's key performance metrics continue to march higher, with total payment volume traversing its platforms consistently climbing by a double-digit percentage. It's important to recognize that we're still very early in the digital payment adoption cycle, and PayPal is leading that charge."", ""What's even more noteworthy for PayPal is that its users are more engaged than ever. As of the end of 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, active PayPal accounts were averaging just shy of 41 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. Based on the company's third-quarter report (ended Sept. 30, 2023), its active accounts are now averaging closer to 57 transactions over the TTM. As a usage-driven model, this is excellent news for PayPal and its shareholders."", ""PayPal's new CEO, Alex Chriss, is making waves as well. Chriss has the knowledge to identify areas of growth for PayPal, but isn't afraid to reduce costs in order to bolster the company's operating margin. When coupled with an aggressive share repurchase program, PayPal stock is cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Fundamentally, as people slow down to reflect on what’s important in life – family, friends, and a general belief in the greater good – they may be more inclined to give their equity holdings a nice lift.', 'Known as the Santa Claus rally, the seasonal trend – with possible explanations stemming from broader feelings of optimism to more specific frameworks such as end-of-year tax considerations – can have a discernibly positive influence on the equities market. Therefore, investors may want to position themselves now into the so-called best Christmas stocks to buy.', 'Moreover, last year’s nod from Jolly Old Saint Nicholas left some investors with coal in their stockings.

Cynically, that could turn out to be a brilliant catalyst for the three best Christmas stocks to buy mentioned below.', 'Admittedly, home improvement retailer Lowe’s doesn’t exactly light up the holiday mood. When you think about the popular brand, many times, it’s because something unpleasant happened: your picket fence got blown over by a strong gust of wind or an unexpected failure caused your toilet to overflow, among other terrible things. Of course, we all want Santa to show up, but Murphy’s Law is never too far away.', 'Yet, the unpredictability of Mother Nature, especially with recent storms in the U.S. Eastern region, underscores a universal truth: weather conditions don’t care about our social gatherings and festivities. While it’s never fun to deal with these challenges, Lowe’s offers a reliable platform to acquire necessary tools and materials.', 'Further, inclement weather conditions and national emergencies have been known to bolster the home improvement retail industry. This is not just empty speculation.', 'On the financial front, investors should be encouraged by the consistency and predictability of the underlying business. For example, Lowe’s gross margin comes in at 33.7% as of its most recent quarter. That’s roughly in line with historical norms, both pre- and post-pandemic. And if you need a little more coaxing, Lowe’s offers a dividend yield of 2.06%.', 'Turning to Wall Street, LOW stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 10 Holds, and zero Sell ratings.

On a fundamental level, the company stands poised to benefit from the trade-down effect or consumers seeking cheaper alternatives to previously purchased goods and services.', 'As you know, while the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates throughout 2022 and into the current year, inflation remains stubbornly elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms.

The Orion Assembly plant in Orion Township, Mich., will bear the brunt of the cuts, with 945 workers facing layoffs as the facility winds down production of the Chevrolet Bolt and will be retooled to manufacture electric trucks. Another 369 employees at the Lansing Grand River Assembly plant, in Lansing, Mich., will also lose their job as production of the Camaro, a muscle car synonymous with Detroit's golden age, sunsets. GM had previously announced it would end production of the Camaro in January 2024, before deciding to end production about a month earlier in December."", 'The news comes as GM, like many automakers, grapples with the seismic shift toward electric vehicles. GM CEO Mary Barra’s plans to turn around the company hinges on a successful transition to electric vehicle manufacturing, which she reiterated during a press event this month. The company’s strategy, however, has been hampered by stagnant demand for electric vehicles and rising costs to produce them. In fact, the Orion plant, which is being refurbished for electric trucks, won’t be operational until 2025, as the company tries to figure out how to make them at a lower cost.', '“Barra and the team have to rip the Band Aid off and significantly cut costs in areas that might not pan out like expected,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.', ""Not all analysts see these job cuts as results of belt tightening. The Lansing layoffs came as a result of the plans to end production of the Camaro, which were in March, before the industry was hit with a strike that cost GM $200 million a week, and would have happened “regardless of what else is going on” in the industry, according to David Whiston, an auto industry analyst at Morningstar Research.\xa0Official word of the layoffs came last month, according to a notice GM filed with Michigan's Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity."", 'Some of the workers laid off at both facilities could possibly rejoin GM at a different location, a GM spokesperson told Fortune.', 'GM’s relationship with its workers was at the fore of the United Auto Workers strike earlier this year. The strike affected all the so-called Big Three auto manufacturers, which also include Stellantis and Ford. In November, the UAW ratified the new labor agreement with GM after a 55% to 45% vote in favor of the deal. The new contract, which runs through April 2028, guaranteed workers a 25% increase to their base wage. GM estimated the contract would raise its costs by $9.3 billion over the length of the agreement, averaging to a $575 increase per vehicle.', ""The new labor agreement added “25% to 30% costs from a labor perspective into their infrastructure,” Ives says. “Investors don't want to see that come out of the bottom line. They'd rather [GM] cut costs to preserve profitability and margin targets.”"", 'Whiston says the new contract only played a minimal role in these decisions. “GM’s moves are to help offset higher labor costs from the new UAW contract, but even without the contract, cost reduction is critical for GM and other legacy OEMs as they transition to EVs and compete with Tesla’s cost advantage,” he said.', ""This week GM also announced layoffs of about a quarter of the workforce, or roughly 900 employees, from its Cruise division, which was working on self-driving cars. Cruise, which has a robotaxi service in San Francisco, has been hit with a slew of struggles since GM acquired it for $1 billion in 2016. The once-promising startup was involved in an October car accident that left a woman severely injured. In the aftermath, executives failed to fully disclose the details of the accident when it was investigated by the California DMV. In November, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt resigned. “Cruise was the golden child, now it's been a black eye,” Ives said."", 'Employees remaining at GM’s corporate offices might find the company becoming less flexible moving forward. Earlier this week, Barra sent employees an email reprimanding them for not having adhered closely enough to the company’s policy of being in the office three days a week. ""We are now explicitly requesting hybrid employees to be onsite beginning Jan. 8, every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday at minimum,” the email read.', ""Whiston said he saw little connection between the impending factory layoffs and GM’s stricter return to office policy. Ives, on the other hand, argued it as an attempt to unify the company, as it prepares to undergo a critical transition. “It's talking the talk, but then walking the walk from a corporate perspective,” he said. “Your factory workers can't work from home. Culturally it was the right move.”"", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Now, these layoffs that are being announced today not necessarily a huge surprise.', ""It's also important to point out that this also follows just about a month after the company reached that massive deal with the UAW.

That plant is going to be idle as they look ahead to try to transition it to prepare it for producing electric pickup trucks here in the future. So a number of these workers, unfortunately, being laid off as a result of that."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. One of the huge things that we were tracking, especially coming off of the negotiations with the UAW was how the automakers would look across the total headcount that they had at many of these factories and try to understand, OK, for a lot of the initiatives that we've set forth, whether that be in autonomous driving, of course, a far off goal that many of the automakers have discussed, and some of them rolled out in some facet or another, whether that be electric vehicles, where they've set multi-year targets and, unfortunately, been met with a market demand profile that's been vastly different perhaps early innings than what they anticipated."", ""And needing to make sure that they're securing margins for right now for the amount of headcount that they had, it was likely that they were going to go into the negotiation tables, say, OK, we're comfortable ultimately once they netted out a deal with a set target, and we saw what the numbers were once the UAW finally got deals with GM with Stellantis with Ford as well."", ""And you just had this sense that they were going to look across each of these plants and figure out, OK, well, where do we need to start rolling back the headcount in order to actually deliver upon much of the financial targets that we've just signed off on and ratified with the existing and remaining members now at this point in time."", ""SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And that coupled with the fact that demand for EVs isn't necessarily where they were hoping it would be at this point, and it's caused GM, it's caused Ford, it's caused a number of these automakers to scale back their EV plans at least for now.

Despite the impressive run for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in 2023, many large-cap stocks have underperformed for various reasons. The three highly-ranked stocks we dig into today—DocuSign (DOCU), Nike (NKE), and Target (TGT)—are all trading at least 30% below their highs and could be poised for serious comebacks in 2024.', 'Jay Powell and the Fed gave the green light to the bulls on Wednesday when the world’s most important central bank signaled the possibility of three rate cuts in 2024. The 10-year U.S. Treasury is back below 4% (3.92%) after sitting at 5% in late October as Wall Street rapidly prices in lower rates.', 'The Fed’s newfound dovishness finally confirms what the bulls have been saying and doing for a large chunk of 2023 and certainly since the end of October. The S&P 500 appears on the cusp of summiting a new peak by the end of 2023 or early 2024.', 'All of this strength came before we even entered the official Santa Claus rally period, which includes the final five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.', 'There will likely be some selling and choppiness in the weeks and months ahead. Still, more money is poised to flow into stocks in 2024 as the calculus on cash and bonds changes and investors grow increasingly nervous about missing out again.', 'DocuSign, Inc. (DOCU)', 'DocuSign crushed our Q3 FY24 EPS estimate on December 7 and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. DOCU stock has soared 30% in the last month to retake its 50-day, its 200-day, and its long-term 50-week moving averages.

The company remains a powerhouse of electronic signatures, document generation, and beyond as medical forms, legal documents, and much more are becoming increasingly paperless. DocuSign has responded to its slower growth and higher rate environment by cutting costs, changing leadership, and rolling out other efforts to streamline its business.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'DocuSign’s valuation levels remain sky-high. But DOCU is focused on the bottom line. Investors might want to consider the e-signature and digital document firm with 1.4 million customers as Wall Street begins to search high and low for technology stocks that are still trading far below their highs.', 'Nike, Inc. (NKE)', 'Nike trades around 30% below its highs heading into its Q2 FY24 earnings release on December 21. Wall Street sold Nike shares based on fears about growing competition and other headwinds. NKE also got caught up in the broader consumer discretionary selloff. Nike certainly faces increased competition from relative newcomers Hoka and On in the running shoe segment and among consumers looking for maximum comfort and support at their jobs.

Nike trades near its 10-year median at 29.7X forward 12-month earnings and pays a dividend.', 'Target (TGT)', 'Target posted blowout Q3 earnings results in mid-November and provided upbeat guidance that helped it capture a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The strong bottom-line performance extended its recent rebound that has TGT stock up 30% since the start of the fourth quarter. Even with the comeback, the retail standout trades 45% below its highs.', 'TGT’s resurgence has taken it right to its 50-week moving average and solidly above its 200-day and 50-day. Target trades at a 30% discount to its sector, 32% below Walmart (WMT), and close to TGT’s 10-year median. TGT stock is far more than a plummeting pandemic winner. Target crushed Walmart over the last 15 years, up 310% vs. 170% despite its massive fall from its 2021 highs.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns over the last year-plus.

206,c0fc26aa-f88c-34ab-971b-ba7ecf250fcd,RCL,2023-12-16,Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) Takes On Some Risk With Its Use Of Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruises-nyse-rcl-130044441.html,1702731644,STORY,['RCL'],"[""Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Royal Caribbean Cruises had debt of US$19.6b at the end of September 2023, a reduction from US$22.9b over a year. However, it also had US$600.1m in cash, and so its net debt is US$19.0b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Royal Caribbean Cruises had liabilities of US$9.24b due within a year, and liabilities of US$18.9b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$600.1m as well as receivables valued at US$360.2m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$27.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$31.4b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Weak interest cover of 1.6 times and a disturbingly high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.1 hit our confidence in Royal Caribbean Cruises like a one-two punch to the gut. This means we'd consider it to have a heavy debt load. However, the silver lining was that Royal Caribbean Cruises achieved a positive EBIT of US$2.3b in the last twelve months, an improvement on the prior year's loss. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Royal Caribbean Cruises's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Royal Caribbean Cruises actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last year. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces."", ""Royal Caribbean Cruises's interest cover and net debt to EBITDA definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience. When we consider all the factors discussed, it seems to us that Royal Caribbean Cruises is taking some risks with its use of debt. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Royal Caribbean Cruises (1 is concerning)  you should be aware of."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

These towers are leased to wireless service providers who need the infrastructure to support their networks and deliver services to customers.

This sale represents a notable change in the insider's holdings and warrants an analysis of the potential reasons behind the move and its impact on the stock's valuation."", ""Over the past year, Jason Silberstein's trading record shows a clear pattern: he has sold 16,465 shares in total and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity could suggest various things, including portfolio rebalancing, personal financial planning, or a response to the company's valuation."", 'The insider transaction history for SBA Communications Corp reveals a lack of insider buying over the past year, with zero insider purchases recorded. On the other hand, there have been 13 insider sells during the same period, indicating a trend where insiders are choosing to liquidate rather than accumulate shares.', ""On the date of the insider's recent sale, shares of SBA Communications Corp were trading at $255.44, giving the company a market capitalization of $26,808,848,000. This valuation places the stock at a price-earnings ratio of 54.73, which is significantly higher than the industry median of 17.73. However, it is lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, suggesting a mixed picture in terms of valuation."", ""Considering the stock's price of $255.44 against the GuruFocus Value (GF Value) of $373.59, SBA Communications Corp has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.68. This ratio positions the stock as a Possible Value Trap, indicating that investors should think twice before making an investment decision based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus. It is calculated using a combination of historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates provided by Morningstar analysts."", ""When analyzing insider buy/sell activities, it's crucial to consider the relationship between these transactions and the stock price. In the case of SBA Communications Corp, the insider's decision to sell shares at a price below the GF Value could be interpreted in several ways. It might suggest that the insider believes the stock is currently overvalued, despite the GF Value indicating otherwise. Alternatively, the sale could be unrelated to the company's valuation, driven instead by personal financial considerations or a strategic portfolio adjustment."", ""Investors often look at insider selling as a negative signal, assuming that insiders might have access to information that leads them to reduce their stake. However, insider sales can occur for various reasons that do not necessarily reflect a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects. For instance, insiders might sell shares to diversify their investments, fund personal expenses, or take advantage of a stock's high market price."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell transaction by Jason Silberstein at SBA Communications Corp presents an intriguing scenario for investors. While the insider's activity and the company's valuation metrics provide important data points, they should be considered as part of a broader investment analysis. Investors should conduct their due diligence, taking into account the company's financial health, growth prospects, and market conditions before making any investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Specifically, Rajat Taneja has sold a total of 172,211 shares and has not made any purchases. This could be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, insiders might sell shares for personal reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future, such as diversifying their investments or financing personal expenditures.On the other hand, consistent selling by insiders, particularly without any offsetting insider buying, might raise questions about their confidence in the company's valuation or growth prospects.

Its cloud-based infrastructure reduces the expenses related to on-premise servers. The automated check-in facility offers nearly real-time, touchless entry into the venue, reducing congestion and delays at the entrance. These features will empower fans to maximize their enjoyment from on-field action and seamlessly utilize the venue amenities.Along with improving overall safety and security, these advanced features will also ensure better resource management in the stadium.

During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share, indicating a change of -9.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $4.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.3%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.', 'Valuation', ""No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) over 20 years ago for artists and PC gamers.

Cummins Inc. is doing its part.', 'Cummins has been investing globally in hydrogen-making electrolyzers as part of its Destination 2050 decarbonization plan. But even its aggressive approach won’t meet the midcentury demand for hundreds of millions of kilograms a year.', 'Hydrogen, a naturally occurring gas, is the most abundant substance in the universe. It emits only water vapor when burned. Green hydrogen is created using a process called electrolysis. Electricity from renewable sources is used to split the hydrogen molecules from the oxygen molecules in water emitting greenhouse-gas emissions.', 'Hydrogen could contribute more than 20% of annual global emissions reductions by 2050, according to McKinsey & Co. research.', 'That is a stretch target for even the most aggressive hydrogen equipment producers like Accelera by Cummins.', '“We’re in the process of scaling up,” Andreas Lippert, Accelera by Cummins’ recently named vice president of electrolyzers, told me. “We’ve made these commitments in terms of manufacturing plants. We have about 300 megawatts of backlog up to 2026 in North America alone.”', 'Accelera’s biggest single output of hydrogen is 10 tons per day. That might roll up to 360,000 tons a year. Industries from steel to ammonia use 70 million tons of hydrogen a year. Cummins’ largest current project is the 20-megawatt proton exchange membrane electrolyzer plant in Bécancour, Canada.', 'Commissioning is underway for a 25-megawatt plant with Florida Power & Light. Accelera also is working with German multinational chemical company Linde GmbH on a 35-megawatt electrolyzer installation at Niagara Falls where hydropower creates the electricity needed to make green hydrogen.', '“If you believe even half of what McKinsey puts out there as 350 to 400 million tons a year by 2050, it’s a huge, huge space,” Lippert said.', 'The company is converting more than 25% of its plant in Fridley, Minnesota — where President Joe Biden visited in April — to make electrolyzers. Is it ironic that the rest of the facility assembles diesel-powered generators, which detract from rather than help Cummins’ climate change ambitions?', '“What is helpful to keep in mind is not to be so picky,” Lippert said. “We have to pursue every possible option if we really want to get to the goal of net zero by 2050. And so for Cummins, all of these things play together.”', 'Even as Cummins focuses on a future where fossil fuels recede in importance, they remain in the picture for a long time.', 'Making green hydrogen from renewable feedstocks like solar and wind power doesn’t mean it will end up being used that way.', '“We can’t necessarily control every electron that comes into the electrolyzer,” Lippert said. “Florida Power & Light [has] a huge solar park. It’s solar power going in and hydrogen coming out. And that is being blended into combustion turbines to provide greener electricity, storing it in the form of hydrogen and making it available at a different time.”', 'Accelera avoids making the good an enemy of the best. If all-green hydrogen is the best, then green hydrogen blended with other feedstocks is the good.', '“We’ve had a project with Enbridge in Canada that’s been running for quite a while where they’re blending [hydrogen] in. It is a meaningful step to decarbonize,” Lippert said. “Part of our Destination Zero message is, ‘Start today, even if it’s smaller steps.’ Cumulatively that has more impact than waiting on a magic technology at a future date.”', 'An electrolyzer uses electricity and water to make hydrogen. It is the opposite of a fuel cell, which uses hydrogen to make electricity from hydrogen. But they can work together.', '“The key where this electrolyzer fuel cell combination does come in is if you have lots of renewable power that you then can convert and buffer in the form of hydrogen and then run the fuel cell on that hydrogen to provide peaks of charging,” Lippert said.', 'Consider multiple megawatt charging stations addressing battery-electric and hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks. Stationary fuel cells, like those planned by fuel cell developer Hyzon Motors, could charge overnight and provide power during peak periods when utilities assess demand charges.', '“The electrolyzer and fuel cell combo makes sense if you have a lot of wind power at night, which is the case in a lot of regions,” Lippert said. “So you can store that wind power through the electrolyzer in hydrogen [and] smooth that curve.', '“You actually need a very thick artery for some of these charging stations, and the grid just doesn’t have it. So you need to create large amounts of power in a very decentralized way with these EV charging stations. You need a way to get energy there. Hydrogen could be a way to address that.”', 'Electric commercial truck charging network service provider Greenlane and Uber Freight will collaborate to accelerate development of public charging infrastructure.', 'The Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture is making the Endurant XD series automated transmission available in certain Daimler Truck Western Star and Freightliner models.', 'Milence, the $593 million electric truck charging joint venture of Daimler Truck, Traton Group and Volvo Group announced in 2021, has opened the first phase of a charging hub in the Netherlands.', 'Our Next Energy (ONE) has named Paul Humphries as CEO, succeeding co-founder Mujeeb Ijaz. He will become chief technology officer of the Novi, Michigan-based energy storage technology company.', 'Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that electric vehicles and fuel-cell vehicles are expected to avoid almost 1.8 million barrels of oil a day in 2023, or about 4.1% of road transport sector demand.

(NYSE:CMI) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Cummins’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' See our latest analysis for Cummins ', 'According to my valuation model, Cummins seems to be fairly priced at around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Cummins today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $281.60, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Cummins’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 7.2% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Cummins, at least in the short term.', 'Are you a shareholder? CMI’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Recently, Scot Rogers, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel of F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV), sold 1,500 shares of the company on December 12, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of market watchers and raises questions about the implications for F5 Inc's stock."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with FFIV.', ""Scot Rogers serves as the Executive Vice President and General Counsel of F5 Inc, a position that places him in the upper echelons of the company's decision-making hierarchy.

Over the past year, Scot Rogers has sold a total of 4,500 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity might suggest that the insider sees limited upside potential or perceives the current stock price as overvalued relative to the company's future growth prospects."", ""When examining the broader insider transaction history for F5 Inc, we observe that there have been no insider buys over the past year, contrasted with 30 insider sells. This trend could indicate a consensus among insiders that the stock's current valuation is fully priced or potentially inflated."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of F5 Inc were trading at $175, giving the company a market cap of $10.561 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 26.92, slightly higher than the industry median of 26.73 and above the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This elevated P/E ratio may further support the notion that insiders, including Scot Rogers, consider the stock to be fairly valued or leaning towards the expensive side."", ""However, it's important to note that the stock's price-to-GF-Value ratio is 0.95, based on a GF Value of $184.12.

While the company's stock is deemed Fairly Valued based on the GF Value, the consistent pattern of insider selling over the past year could be a sign that those with intimate knowledge of the company's workings are taking a more conservative stance on its valuation. As always, insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle, and investors should consider a wide array of factors, including market conditions, company performance, and broader economic indicators, before making investment decisions."", ""For those invested in F5 Inc or considering a position, monitoring insider activity will continue to be an important aspect of gauging the stock's potential. As the market digests the implications of Scot Rogers's sale, it will be crucial to watch for any shifts in insider sentiment that could signal changes in the company's outlook."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.31 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 31%.

To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 44% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Colgate-Palmolive might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""In summary, Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 41% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come.

The U.S. insurance companies have adequate liquidity metrics and favorable financial flexibility options through its access to the capital markets and membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank.', 'AM Best also has a favorable view of Prudential’s operating performance profile, as revenues are diversified across its insurance premiums, mortality and expense fees and administration fees from insurance and investment products.

The pension risk transfer business has also changed its risk profile over the past decade and the large deals and successful practice has positioned Prudential to be among the top market participants. AM Best also acknowledges the strategies Prudential employs to transition to less market-sensitive variable annuity and universal life products, which has resulted in lowering the company’s traditional variable annuities account values by approximately 40% and is projected to reduce their guaranteed universal life reserves by approximately 33% following the closing of its deal with Somerset Reinsurance Ltd.

Snowflake helps companies clean up and aggregate large amounts of data for third-party applications through its cloud-based data warehouses. Oracle is the world's largest database software company, and it's transformed a lot of its on-site applications into cloud-based services over the past decade."", ""Snowflake usually attracts growth-oriented investors, while Oracle's slower expansion rates, stable profits, and steady dividends make it more appealing to value-oriented investors. But over the past three years, Snowflake's stock declined about 45% as Oracle's shares soared 66%. Let's see why that happened and whether Oracle is still the better buy."", 'Snowflake has grown like a weed since its public debut in September 2020. Its product revenue (which accounts for most of its top line) soared 120% in fiscal 2021 (ended in January 2021), 106% in fiscal 2022, and 70% in fiscal 2023.', ""It grew rapidly for three reasons. First, it was compatible with a wide range of public cloud platforms -- including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure -- and didn't lock its clients into a stickier cloud ecosystem. Second, it only charged its users for the computing power and storage they used instead of locking them into subscriptions. Finally, it broke down the silos across different departments and computing platforms by pulling all of an organization's data into a centralized location where it could be easily analyzed to make business decisions."", ""But in fiscal 2024, Snowflake only expects its product revenue to rise 37% to $2.65 billion as macro headwinds drive companies to rein in their cloud spending. However, it still forecasts $10 billion in product revenue by fiscal 2029, which implies its top line will climb at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2029. That long-term outlook is ambitious, but a lot of growth has been baked into its stock, which is priced 22 times this year's sales."", ""Snowflake's adjusted operating margins have been expanding, but it remains deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. All of that red ink -- along with its slowing growth and frothy valuation -- made it an easy target for the bears as interest rates rose over the past two years."", ""Oracle is growing a lot slower than Snowflake. Its revenue only rose 4% in fiscal 2021 (ended in May 2021), climbed 5% in fiscal 2022, and increased 7% on an organic basis (excluding its acquisition of the healthcare giant Cerner) in fiscal 2023. But it's also firmly profitable, has generated plenty of cash, and has consistently bought back its shares."", ""Most of Oracle's recent growth has been driven by its cloud-based software and infrastructure services, which accounted for 37% of its top line in its latest quarter. Its cloud growth has decelerated amid the macro headwinds over the past year, but it's still offsetting the slower expansion of its legacy on-site hardware and software businesses."", ""Oracle's operating margins also continue to widen as it scales up its cloud segment, streamlines Cerner's lower-margin business, and executes other cost-cutting measures. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, its trailing-12-month free cash flow (FCF) had risen 20% year over year to $10.1 billion. That robust cash flow growth enabled it to buy back $600 million in shares in the first half of fiscal 2024 while paying out $2.2 billion in dividends."", ""Analysts expect Oracle's revenue and adjusted EPS to both increase 8% this year. Its stock still seems reasonably valued at 18 times forward earnings and it pays a decent forward yield of 1.4%. Oracle probably won't impress growth, value, or income investors anytime soon, but its stability has made it an appealing safe-haven stock as rising interest rates rattled the market. That's probably why it outperformed Snowflake over the past three years."", ""Snowflake is still growing, but its high valuation could limit its gains over the next few years. Oracle's growth rates are less impressive, but it should remain the better investment as long as interest rates stay high in this tough macro environment."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.

262,a95dbb32-40d5-325d-886d-5dd115ce3acd,MU,2023-12-16,Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) Is Making Moderate Use Of Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-nasdaq-mu-making-110128513.html,1702724488,STORY,"['MU', 'BRK-B']","[""The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", 'Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Micron Technology ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at August 2023 Micron Technology had debt of US$12.0b, up from US$6.02b in one year. On the flip side, it has US$9.59b in cash leading to net debt of about US$2.46b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Micron Technology had liabilities of US$4.77b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$15.4b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$9.59b as well as receivables valued at US$2.44b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$8.10b.', ""Of course, Micron Technology has a titanic market capitalization of US$89.9b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Micron Technology's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Over 12 months, Micron Technology made a loss at the EBIT level, and saw its revenue drop to US$16b, which is a fall of 50%. That makes us nervous, to say the least.', ""While Micron Technology's falling revenue is about as heartwarming as a wet blanket, arguably its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss is even less appealing. Indeed, it lost US$5.5b at the EBIT level. Considering that alongside the liabilities mentioned above does not give us much confidence that company should be using so much debt. So we think its balance sheet is a little strained, though not beyond repair. Another cause for caution is that is bled US$6.1b in negative free cash flow over the last twelve months. So suffice it to say we consider the stock very risky. For riskier companies like Micron Technology I always like to keep an eye on whether insiders are buying or selling. So  click here if you want to find out for yourself."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Fundamentally, as people slow down to reflect on what’s important in life – family, friends, and a general belief in the greater good – they may be more inclined to give their equity holdings a nice lift.', 'Known as the Santa Claus rally, the seasonal trend – with possible explanations stemming from broader feelings of optimism to more specific frameworks such as end-of-year tax considerations – can have a discernibly positive influence on the equities market. Therefore, investors may want to position themselves now into the so-called best Christmas stocks to buy.', 'Moreover, last year’s nod from Jolly Old Saint Nicholas left some investors with coal in their stockings. However, the mood this year seemingly represents a paradigm shift. Given the bad taste that some felt one year ago, bitter market participants may be looking to even the score. Cynically, that could turn out to be a brilliant catalyst for the three best Christmas stocks to buy mentioned below.', 'Admittedly, home improvement retailer Lowe’s doesn’t exactly light up the holiday mood. When you think about the popular brand, many times, it’s because something unpleasant happened: your picket fence got blown over by a strong gust of wind or an unexpected failure caused your toilet to overflow, among other terrible things. Of course, we all want Santa to show up, but Murphy’s Law is never too far away.', 'Yet, the unpredictability of Mother Nature, especially with recent storms in the U.S. Eastern region, underscores a universal truth: weather conditions don’t care about our social gatherings and festivities. While it’s never fun to deal with these challenges, Lowe’s offers a reliable platform to acquire necessary tools and materials.', 'Further, inclement weather conditions and national emergencies have been known to bolster the home improvement retail industry. This is not just empty speculation.', 'On the financial front, investors should be encouraged by the consistency and predictability of the underlying business. For example, Lowe’s gross margin comes in at 33.7% as of its most recent quarter. That’s roughly in line with historical norms, both pre- and post-pandemic. And if you need a little more coaxing, Lowe’s offers a dividend yield of 2.06%.', 'Turning to Wall Street, LOW stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys, 10 Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average LOW stock price target is $225.25, implying that shares are trading at about fair value.', 'While Mondelez International doesn’t quite excite the senses for investors, as a play on the best Christmas stocks to buy, the confectionery specialist – which owns compelling brands such as Oreo – delivers the goods. On a fundamental level, the company stands poised to benefit from the trade-down effect or consumers seeking cheaper alternatives to previously purchased goods and services.', 'As you know, while the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates throughout 2022 and into the current year, inflation remains stubbornly elevated compared to pre-pandemic norms. Further, several companies across different industries are feeling the pinch of consumers tightening their belts, leading to mass layoffs. That, unfortunately, creates a self-fulfilling cycle of spending cuts for people and enterprises.', 'Under this scenario, getting your culinary delights from the grocery aisle – as opposed to an expensive retail food establishment – may be more palatable. Even better, Mondelez appears to be well-suited for this fading environment, making it one of the best Christmas stocks to buy.', 'Specifically, its gross margin has been rising (to 38.7% as of the most recent quarter). Therefore, the brand may be enjoying pricing power, meaning that consumers are flocking to Mondelez despite the broader impact of inflation. Also, MDLZ carries a dividend yield of 2.2%, providing a confidence boost.', 'Turning to Wall Street, MDLZ stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average MDLZ stock price target is $79.50, implying 12.4% upside potential.', 'With the top two ideas for the best Christmas stocks to buy, they present relatively sensible market acquisitions. However, if you want to dial up the risk-to-reward profile, you may consider digital payments specialist PayPal Holdings. A company that has been doing financial technology (fintech) before that term became popularized, PayPal naturally commands a strong market presence when it comes to payment alternatives.', 'However, PayPal was slow to respond to the buy now, pay later (BNPL) phenomenon. It was only in recent years that the company released its BNPL offering called Pay in 4. Conspicuously, though, such solutions emerged early last decade. With tech measured on an accelerated scale, to lose years to the competition represents a massive no-no.', 'That said, business leaders can’t afford to cry over spilled milk. Having learned from its mistakes, PayPal arguably stands in a position to leverage its global footprint to shake up the BNPL market. Even better, this year’s strong Black Friday sales, in large part, stemmed from BNPL use, according to The Wall Street Journal.', 'PayPal has an opportunity to shine. For investors, what makes PYPL enticing is its valuation. Right now, PYPL trades at only about 2.4x trailing-year sales. However, the software application industry runs an average revenue multiple of 4.07x.', 'Turning to Wall Street, PYPL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, 14 Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average PYPL stock price target is $74.32, implying 21.5% upside potential.', 'While last year’s Santa Claus rally may have been a dud, renewed sentiment, along with the general rise of the festive mood, could translate to broader gains. Still, these specific ideas may benefit the most from the seasonal trend.', 'Disclosure']"

After all, many investors are on vacation and take a break from buying and selling stocks. Interestingly, though, the S&P 500 often rises noticeably in the final five trading days of December and the first two days in January.', 'Three Motley Fool contributors think they\'ve identified fantastic stocks that are especially likely to enjoy this kind of ""Santa Claus rally."" Here\'s why they picked AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).', ""Keith Speights (AbbVie): We won't have to wait until after Christmas for one beaten-down stock to rally. The rally has already begun for AbbVie: Shares of the big drugmaker have jumped more than 10% since Thanksgiving. I think this momentum could continue into the new year."", ""Two big business-development deals appear to have renewed investors' interest in AbbVie. On Nov. 30, the company announced plans to buy ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion. A week later, AbbVie revealed that it intends to acquire Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion. Both transactions appear to be smart moves that will bolster AbbVie's pipeline and, in the case of ImmunoGen, add an approved cancer therapy with fast-growing sales to its lineup."", ""Speaking of cancer therapies, investors also have a reason to be optimistic about AbbVie's epcoritamab. The drugmaker recently announced positive results for the experimental bispecific antibody in a phase 1/2 study for treating relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The therapy has already been approved in both the United States and the European Union in treating certain types of large B-cell lymphoma. Analysts project that epcoritamab could generate peak annual sales of close to $3 billion."", ""I also think that the increasing prospects of interest-rate cuts next year could entice some income investors to shift money into AbbVie stock. Lower rates will cause bond yields to fall, but could provide a catalyst for stocks. AbbVie's current dividend yield of 4% and its status as a Dividend King could be a winning combination for income investors seeking better alternatives to bonds."", 'Prosper Junior Bakiny (CRISPR Therapeutics): The past few weeks have been eventful for CRISPR Therapeutics. The most crucial development for the company is that it finally earned approval for gene-editing therapy Casgevy as a treatment for sickle cell disease in the U.S. and the U.K., and for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) in the U.K. A U.S. approval decision on the TDT indication is expected by March 30, 2024.', ""However, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares have been falling, probably partly because some investors decided to take their profits now that the biotech has achieved this important milestone. So why think CRISPR Therapeutics could profit from a Santa Claus rally?"", ""These things are always hard to predict, but the feat the company just accomplished is nothing to sneeze at. It earned the world's first approval for a CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment -- a technique that recently won its creators a Nobel prize."", ""Furthermore, with a price tag of $2.2 million in the U.S., Casgevy's total addressable market is massive. Even with just the 32,000 patients it plans to target together with its partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), it comes out to a total of a little over $70 billion. That's before we consider that CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex could target far more patients if given label expansions. Casgevy's peak sales probably won't come anywhere close to matching its full market opportunity, but they don't have to for CRISPR Therapeutics to be a big winner."", ""While it isn't surprising to see some investors jump on the opportunity to take some profits, others might soon decide to initiate positions given how promising CRISPR Therapeutics' prospects just became.

The company, along with its big partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), won U.S. regulatory approval for Casgevy (exa-cel) in treating sickle cell disease (SCD) on Dec. 8, 2023. Casgevy picked up U.K. approval for SCD and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia last month."", 'Despite the milestone U.S. approval, CRISPR Therapeutics stock sank nearly 19% after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made its decision. Shares have rebounded somewhat but remain close to 15% below the previous high.', 'We could be seeing a textbook case of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" with CRISPR Therapeutics. But here\'s the one key reason why you might want to buy the gene-editing stock on the dip.', ""Before we get to that reason for buying CRISPR Therapeutics, I'll let you know upfront that it has little to do with Casgevy. There's a simple explanation why that's the case."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics currently has a market cap of close to $5 billion even with the recent sell-off. That's a steep valuation for a biotech that has yet to rake in a penny of product sales. The reality is that the revenue prospects for Casgevy are already largely baked into CRISPR Therapeutics' share price."", ""Goldman Sachs analysts think that Casgevy could generate worldwide peak annual sales of $3.9 billion. However, that's higher than what other analysts project. The consensus is that Casgevy will achieve peak annual sales in the ballpark of $2.2 billion, according to Bloomberg. That's still a lot of money, but there are two important things to keep in mind."", ""First, it's going to take years to come anywhere close to reaching that level. Analysts don't expect Casgevy to hit $1 billion in sales until 2027. Vertex also hinted in its latest quarterly conference call that the ramp-up could be slow."", ""Second, CRISPR Therapeutics will receive only 40% of the net profits from Casgevy. So when you see a peak sales estimate of $2.2 billion, it means that CRISPR Therapeutics' part will be much lower."", ""Note that I said that the key reason you might want to buy CRISPR Therapeutics has little to do with Casgevy but didn't state that it has nothing to do with the already-approved gene-editing therapy. That's because the money the company will make from Casgevy will help fund its ongoing research and development."", ""I don't think investors should buy CRISPR Therapeutics primarily to capitalize on the likely success of Casgevy. Instead, the main reason to consider buying the stock is for what the company could have on the way."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics\' pipeline features six clinical-stage programs in addition to Casgevy. The company owns all of the rights to five of them. CTX110 and CTX112 are allogeneic (""off-the-shelf"") CAR-T therapies targeting CD19+ malignancies and autoimmune diseases. CTX130 and CTX131 are off-the-shelf CAR-T therapies targeting CD70 in T-cell malignancies and solid tumors. CTX310 is in phase 1 testing for treating cardiovascular disease.', 'The company teamed up with ViaCyte (which is now owned by Vertex) to develop allogeneic stem-cell therapies for treating type 1 diabetes. VCTX-211 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical study with results set to potentially be announced in 2025.', 'In addition, CRISPR Therapeutics has several preclinical programs. One of them -- CTX320 -- is on track to advance into early-stage clinical testing in the first half of 2024.', ""CRISPR Therapeutics is emphatically not a stock for everyone. The company's pipeline candidates could fail miserably. It's also possible that Casgevy won't achieve the commercial success that analysts predict. Risk-averse investors should look elsewhere."", ""Aggressive investors, on the other hand, could find this stock attractive. I wouldn't say that CRISPR Therapeutics offers the best risk-reward proposition even among biotech stocks. However, it could have plenty of room to run over the next few years if Casgevy fulfills its potential and the pipeline programs succeed in clinical studies."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

Its gene-editing therapy, which it has been developing with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration for sickle cell disease. It's a turning point for the business, which now has its first approved product."", ""But what's next for the business, and where does CRISPR Therapeutics go from here? Below I'll look at where the company may be in five years, and whether it's a good time to invest in the stock."", ""The CRISPR gene-editing market is expected to be worth $14.8 billion by 2030, according to projections from Straits Research. The industry is growing at an incredibly fast compound annual rate of 29.8%. And amid its early growth, CRISPR is starting to establish itself as a big name in gene editing. It's not a huge market, but CRISPR has the potential to become an early market leader within it."", ""Bluebird Bio also obtained FDA approval for its gene-editing therapy Lyfgenia, but it will have a black box warning on the label related to blood cancer. CRISPR's treatment, Casgevy, comes with no such warning. It's a good example of the company already setting itself apart from rivals as a safer option; Bluebird Bio, despite obtaining approval, crashed following the news as investors feared the warning would cripple the product's sales potential."", 'CRISPR and Vertex are also awaiting approval for their therapy as a treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. The PDUFA date for that is set for March 30, 2024.', 'Further down the road, the company may have other gene-editing therapy treatments that come to market, including CTX112 and CTX131, which are allogeneic CAR T programs that are in early stage trials. CRISPR is also working on the first gene therapy treatment for diabetes with ViaCyte.', ""It's early on, but in five years CRISPR Therapeutics could have more approved therapies and could be well on its way to establishing itself as a leader in the market for gene-editing therapies."", 'Another big question for investors is whether or not CRISPR will be a profitable company in five years. Its recent approval will go a long way towards determining that. At its peak, analysts from Goldman Sachs project that Casgevy could generate up to $3.9 billion in revenue.', ""However, it's important to remember that CRISPR will share any earnings on the treatment with its development partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals, collecting 40% of the profits. In CRISPR's most recent quarterly results, which ended on Sept. 30, the company incurred a net loss of $112.2 million, which is down from $174.5 million in the prior-year period."", ""I don't believe that CRISPR will be profitable in five years, but it will be close to breaking even. While its expenses don't appear astronomical, it will need to spend money on commercialization efforts and its costs will increase. Plus, while the potential is high for Casgevy, it will take a while for it to reach its peak."", ""The good news is that even if it doesn't become profitable in five years, investors can rest assured that at least the business is moving in the right direction."", 'One scenario that could become a very real possibility is that another, larger healthcare company buys out CRISPR Therapeutics in an effort to diversify its operations. Now that CRISPR has an approved gene-editing therapy, it may attract greater interest from big names in the healthcare industry.', ""What's also attractive about CRISPR is that it has minimal debt on its books and lots of cash. Its total liabilities as of the end of September total just $359 million. Meanwhile, the company has more than $1.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. With loads of cash and not much in liabilities to worry about, that could make the stock a highly attractive acquisition target."", ""Predicting an acquisition is difficult, but I think there's a good chance that within the next five years CRISPR could get acquired. At a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, it's a fairly reasonably priced business given what it offers to an acquiror."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics is looking like one of the better healthcare stocks to buy right now. With a high-priced treatment in its portfolio (Casgevy costs $2.2 million) and the potential for it to generate billions in revenue -- as well as tons of cash on its books and relatively modest liabilities -- the stock looks to be a no-brainer buy at this point.

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide non-recurring engineering efforts in support of bringing eight MH-60R aircraft from a standard Foreign Military Sales (FMS) configuration to a unique configuration for the government of Spain.', 'Through this modification, Lockheed will also procure eight embedded global positioning system inertial navigation systems spares, four airborne low-frequency sonars and production spares, and provide associated field service representative support for the MH-60R helicopter.', 'A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Owego, NY; Stratford, CT; and Brest, France.', 'Nations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, military helicopters that play a critical role in military missions have also witnessed a significant rise in demand.To this end, it is imperative to mention that U.S. military helicopters have gained prominence and significant traction lately due to advancements and integration of new tactical, logistical and other important features. Lockheed, being a prominent helicopter manufacturer, thus wins frequent contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies for its combat-proven helicopter programs like the MH-60R Seahawk.Notably, MH-60R brings transformational anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities to navies around the world. Impressively, the global fleet of MH-60R helicopters has achieved 1 million fleet flight hours in early 2023. This helicopter is currently operational with the U.S. Navy, Royal Danish Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Saudi Naval Forces and the Indian Navy.', 'Undoubtedly, this reflects the solid demand that LMT’s MH-60R Seahawk helicopter enjoys in the combat rotorcraft market, which, in turn, ushers in valuable contracts for Lockheed, like the latest one.

Inside Berkshire is a massive stock portfolio of some of Buffett's best investments over his lifetime."", ""Among them is Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Berkshire's fourth-largest position, worth more than $23 billion. The dividends alone are funneling $736 million into the company's coffers."", ""Should investors follow suit and build their own Coca-Cola dividend machines? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Here is what you need to know."", ""Buffett's Coca-Cola investment wasn't always this big. He originally invested $1 billion in 1988, and it's grown for decades. Dividends have been a big part of that. Coca-Cola has paid shareholders a little more each year for decades -- 61 consecutive years of raises, to be exact."", ""You can see below how that can snowball over time. Warren Buffett's $736 million in annual dividends from Coca-Cola today is almost like getting his initial investment back each year."", ""How does Coca-Cola do it? It's the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, with hundreds of products and brands many people worldwide know -- including Coca-Cola, Sprite, and almost two dozen others -- that generate over a billion dollars in annual sales."", ""Just think about the world's population as a market with eight billion customers. Everyone gets thirsty. Competitors lack the size and leverage to get their products on store shelves like Coca-Cola. The company can manufacture growth organically as the population grows; by acquiring and developing new products and brands; or by raising prices."", ""Coca-Cola may not be a growth stock, but it's consistently growing. The global beverage market is so big that Coca-Cola's winning recipe for steady growth should continue for the foreseeable future. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by an average of six percent annually over the long term."", ""Combine that with a healthy 76% dividend payout ratio, and Coca-Cola's dividend should keep growing. Invest, wait, collect your growing dividend, and prosper."", ""However, there is a significant hurdle investors must watch for in the stock's valuation. See, Coca-Cola isn't growing fast enough that you can buy at any price and make a lot of money. Buffett bought shares in 1988 after the famous 1987 stock market crash dragged the stock 30% off its highs."", ""Virtually everyone has heard of Coca-Cola and admires the company's admirable dividend growth streak. Stocks in high esteem don't often come cheap."", ""You can see above that Coca-Cola is susceptible to the occasional stock market crash, but isn't that volatile otherwise. The stock's beta is 0.58, meaning it's less volatile than the broader stock market."", ""It's great that the S&P 500 is near all-time highs today, but that also means that Coca-Cola is carrying its usual price tag. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22 against its estimated 2023 profits. At a six percent long-term growth rate, that's a PEG ratio of nearly four."", ""Go ahead if you want to prioritize building up that dividend income, but Coca-Cola's total returns could languish some until the company's earnings catch up to its share price. Ideally, one could buy shares at a P/E of around 15 to 17, but Coca-Cola rarely goes that low.

The Biden-Harris administration plans to eliminate fossil fuels as a form of energy generation in the United States by 2035 and has set a target of 80% renewable energy generation by 2030.\xa0These ambitious goals have put the spotlight on the utilities industry, a sector that plays a pivotal role in the nation's energy landscape."", 'As the demand for renewable forms of energy grows, so do claims of “greenwashing” — a term that refers to companies misleading consumers about the environmental benefits of their products or services.\xa0In the utility industry, this could mean anything from overstating the proportion of energy derived from renewable sources, to downplaying the environmental impact of non-renewable energy production, to claiming that utilities or their customers can mitigate their carbon footprint through the purchase of carbon offsets.\xa0Greenwashing claims may also allege “double counting” of environmental benefits, such as renewable energy credits or greenhouse gas reduction claims.', 'This opinion piece discusses recent greenwashing claims brought against utility companies, the implications of communications about the transition to “cleaner” forms of energy production, and practical strategies utilities can employ to reduce exposure to greenwashing claims. ', 'Greenwashing is a term used to describe a type of consumer fraud whereby a company provides misleading or deceptive information, either intentionally or unintentionally, about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology or company practice.\xa0Greenwashing can be a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,” as well as state-level consumer protection laws.', 'Currently, there is no federal law defining greenwashing, which makes it difficult for companies to determine what kinds of statements to avoid. The Federal Trade Commission’s Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, informally known as the “Green Guides,” although only agency guidance, are commonly regarded as guideposts for determining what constitutes deceptive environmental marketing practices and are referenced or incorporated in some state consumer protection laws.\xa0 ', 'Greenwashing claims can come in the form of consumer litigation under federal or state law, agency enforcement actions, or be raised in the court of public opinion on online platforms or social media.\xa0Regardless of the venue, these claims draw negative attention to a company, with potential for reputational harm, while also distracting attention from or detracting from a company’s environmentally beneficial activities.', 'Against this backdrop of increased scrutiny over corporate environmental marketing claims from both the public and governmental authorities, utilities have not escaped greenwashing claims. A few recent examples are highlighted below.\xa0 ', 'In September 2021, the Sauk-Suiattle Tribe, based in Darrington, Washington, filed a case accusing Seattle City Light of violating the Washington State Consumer Protection Act by “greenwashing” its reputation “with claims of superlative environmental responsibility,” including that Seattle City Light is “the nation’s greenest utility” because a majority of its electricity comes from non-carbon emitting hydropower.\xa0In March 2023, the Washington State Court of Appeals published a mixed opinion, which affirmed the lower court’s decision that Seattle City Light (1) is not subject to the Consumer Protection Act because it is a municipality, and (2) that the utility’s claim to be the “greenest utility” is “mere puffery,” rather than a statement with the intent to sell more power or increase the consumption of power, so it is cannot give rise to a false advertising claim. The court left alive nuisance claims brought by the tribe alleging that Seattle City Light’s greenwashing wrongly transferred culpability for the detrimental impact on the fisheries to the Tribe, resulting in harm to the Tribe and their interest in the fishery resources.\xa0 ', 'In November 2021, the Maryland Office of the People’s Counsel, or OPC,\xa0filed a complaint with the Maryland Public Service Commission against Washington Gas Light Company and WGL Energy Services Inc. for deceptive green marketing seeking $500,000 in civil penalties from each entity.\xa0The complaint alleges that natural gas bills sent to customers misled customers by describing natural gas as clean energy that is less emissions-intensive and more environmentally friendly than electricity.\xa0The PSC dismissed the complaint in a February 7, 2022,\xa0order, finding that public service companies regulated by the PSC are exempt from the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. The PSC denied rehearing in April 2022 and OPC appealed the decision to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which affirmed the PSC’s orders.\xa0OPC appealed the circuit court decision in July 2023.\xa0 ', 'In July 2022, WGL was hit with another greenwashing claim.\xa0Client Earth and two other organizations sued under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act, or CPPA,\xa0alleging that WGL falsely and deceptively marketed its natural gas products and services as “clean” and sustainable. The plaintiffs alleged that WGL capitalized on consumer demand for reduced reliance on fossil fuels through ads claiming that use of natural gas was a “key driver” of greenhouse gas reductions in Washington, D.C. and that natural gas provides “low carbon” energy that would help the District of Columbia reach carbon-neutral status. The plaintiffs further alleged that WGL’s natural gas products were “decidedly not ‘low carbon,’” and that WGL’s admission that their low-carbon gas supply was 0% in 2018 and was planned to increase to only 2% by 2025 “demonstrates just how misleading their ‘sustainability’ statements to consumers are.” In September 2023, a District of Columbia Superior Court Judge dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the D.C. CPPA does not apply to entities, like WGL, that are regulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission. ', 'On August 11, 2023, the State of California filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company alleging that the utility misled consumers about the environmental attributes of natural gas in connection with environmental marketing claims made in 2019 that natural gas is renewable.\xa0Specifically, SoCalGas advertised that natural gas is renewable, clean and affordable even though most of its natural gas is derived from fossil fuels, which are not renewable.\xa0On August 14, 2023, California’s Attorney General announced a settlement that resolved allegations that SoCalGas’s marketing violated California’s consumer protection laws. The settlement required SoCalGas to 1) refrain from making similar unqualified statements that natural gas is “renewable, 2) pay $175,000 in penalties, and 3) publish a corrective statement on its website within 14 days of the settlement’s effective date.\xa0', 'On March 11, 2022, Dominion Energy Ohio filed an application with the Ohio Public Utilities Commission for approval of a carbon offset program that would provide its customers with the option to “offset” the carbon emitted from the natural gas they buy.\xa0The Decarbon Ohio Program is marketed as a means for customers to reduce their carbon footprint, but environmentalists quoted in an article published on August 18, 2023, are arguing that the program amounts to greenwashing.\xa0Dominion’s “Decarbon Ohio” proposal is still under consideration by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission.', 'While utilities have largely demonstrated resilience against greenwashing claims, prevailing predominantly on procedural and jurisdictional grounds, defending these claims can require a considerable expenditure of time and resources. By adopting a proactive approach, utilities can minimize the potential for greenwashing claims.\xa0There are several concrete actions utilities can take to minimize their exposure to greenwashing claims:', 'Substantiate and qualify claims made in all communications involving company environmental impacts and future environmental commitments, including consumer marketing, investor communications, and state and federal agency disclosures.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Estée Lauder Companies’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity."", ' View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'According to my valuation model, Estée Lauder Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 1.7% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Estée Lauder Companies today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $146.12, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Estée Lauder Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Estée Lauder Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you'd like to know more about Estée Lauder Companies as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Or is it merely a means to an end?', 'It\'s fine if you\'re a so-called market junkie, following the market\'s daily headlines and keeping a constant eye out for the next hot story stock. There\'s also nothing wrong with a boring, passive approach to picking stocks. Indeed, often times the ""less is more"" crowd ends up with better returns than active investors.', ""There's a largely overlooked name more investors might want to consider adding to their portfolio regardless of their long-term goals and risk tolerances. Shares of boring payroll processor outfit Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) are up an incredible 240% for the past 10 years, with more of the same likely in the cards for the next 10."", ""Shares of Automatic Data Processing -- you may know it better as just ADP -- have more than tripled in value since this point in 2013. For comparison, the S&P 500 is up roughly the same amount for the same time frame. Most of the S&P 500's gains were driven by growth stocks though, whereas ADP is more of a value name. Factoring in ADP's better dividend payments, what you're left with is a surprisingly strong performance from a stock not too many investors think much about."", ""Just as the name suggests, Automatic Data Processing offers a variety of processing services. It's best known for handling payroll duties for medium and large businesses, although that's far from all it does. The company provides a variety of other human resources services, too, like recruiting, benefits program management, employee time clocks, tax matters, contract worker paperwork, work-related credentials, and more. It's truly a turnkey HR solution for enterprises looking to focus more on their products and services and worry less about human logistics stuff."", 'Boring? You bet.', ""Don't presume there's no growth in a boring business though. Companies of all shapes and sizes are increasingly turning to third parties to handle increasingly complicated human resources functions. In step with its stock's 240% gain over the course of the past decade, ADP's annualized revenue has grown from $11 billion to more than $18 billion, while net income has exploded from a little over $1.4 billion per year to just under $3.5 billion. Per-share profits have grown even more thanks to big-time stock buybacks, from less than $3 then to $8.42 per share for the four-quarter stretch ending in September."", ""Perhaps even more bullish than the company's long-term growth, however, is the consistency of its growth. Note that with the exception of 2013's reporting of revenue-crimping asset sales initiated in 2012 and the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns in the first half of 2020, Automatic Data Processing hasn't failed to report year-over-year sales growth in any quarter in years. Operating income and net income have grown almost as reliably."", ""This actually makes sense though. ADP's business model generates recurring revenue ultimately based on the scope of services performed. Its clients are billed on a monthly basis, and its revenue retention rate reached record-breaking levels of more than 92% during the fiscal year ending in June. Once a customer is on board, they tend to stay on board."", ""The kicker: Automatic Data Processing is sharing the wealth in the meantime, and has plenty of it to share. The stock's quarterly per-share dividend has grown from $0.435 10 years ago to $1.40 now. Even with that annualized growth rate of more than 12%, however, the dividend still only consumes around two-thirds of the company's profits. The rest of its earnings can be used to add value in other ways, like the aforementioned stock buybacks, the acquisition of other companies, or simply reinvesting in technologies that drive more growth."", ""If you're looking for thrills and entertainment, look elsewhere -- ADP doesn't offer it. The company isn't working on any game-changing technologies or miracle drugs. It's not dishing out double-digit revenue or earnings growth. By most measures, it's a relatively boring stock."", ""It's a boring stock, however, reflecting a powerhouse company operating in an industry with a strong foundation and lots of opportunity for continued expansion."", ""See, the world's always going to need workers, and there's little reason to think more and more companies aren't going to reach a point where they simply decide to punt most -- if not all -- of their human resources functions to third parties like ADP. In this vein, market research outfit Technavio believes this business is set to grow at an annual pace of 5.6% through 2027. Given its current dominating footprint, Automatic Data Processing is positioned to capture more than its fair share of this growth."", ""Just don't tarry if you want in. The stock's still trading where it was as of late 2021. It doesn't seem likely the market's going to let this one linger there for a whole lot longer though."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Automatic Data Processing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Automatic Data Processing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Automatic Data Processing wasn't one of them.

Although the business of renting an apartment is fairly simple to understand, there are a lot of little things that go into the process. UDR has spent two years examining one of the more difficult aspects of the customer relationship, move outs. Management thinks it can bend the curve.', ""One of the things that UDR's management team spends a lot of time talking about is technology. For example, it provides online tools for renting an apartment and online tools for scheduling maintenance once a person becomes a renter. The company is very big on digitizing the business in whatever ways it can to both increase efficiency and to improve the customer experience."", ""That's a good thing to do, of course. But there's more to the effort because it also allows for better tracking of the business overall. For example, management can specifically see how maintenance efforts are playing out and step in if there are problems. But there's one area where UDR isn't doing so well, its retention rate lags a few percentage points behind those of its closest peers."", ""That basically means that more people tend to move out of a UDR property then move out of peer operated properties. That's a problem for the REIT because it is far more costly to fill an empty apartment than it is to retain an existing tenant. For example, a vacant apartment needs cleaning and maintenance work -- perhaps a coat of paint -- before it can be released. Then the unit has to be advertised. And convincing a new tenant to move in might require rent concessions, like free months of rent. More importantly, all through the turnover period the apartment isn't generating any revenue. Simply keeping the old tenant around for another year would be a much better financial outcome."", ""UDR hasn't stuck its head in the sand hoping that things get better. It has examined a decade's worth of data to see why tenants are moving out and it believes that roughly 50% of the issue is controllable. It all boils down to the customer experience. Specific touch points that can be improved include making the move in process better, improved execution on maintenance requests, and an effort to better handle trash, pet waste, and noise issues. In fact, of the top 15 factors the company found, only one was tightly related to the actual cost of the apartment."", 'The company is putting in place processes to start addressing the issues it thinks it can control. So far the news has been positive, with management noting that it believes it can not only get back on par with its peers, but that it can improve its turnover to above industry average levels. This is a bigger issue than it sounds like, particularly right now.', ""UDR ended up trimming its full-year 2023 guidance when it reported third quarter earnings because of an onslaught of new properties coming to market. That's making it tougher to attract new tenants because aggressive pricing at new buildings is allowing renters to get into higher-quality properties (Class A) for what it would have traditionally cost to rent at a lower-quality asset (Class B). If non-rent related issues are leading tenants to leave and UDR can improve those issues, it may be able to retain up to 50% of the move outs it has faced in recent years."", 'That, in turn, will lead to higher occupancy levels and improved financial results because of less down time and lower turnover related expenses. In other words, fixing this problem will blunt the impact of the new supply that is coming to market right now.', ""UDR's decision to lower full-year guidance on top of the ongoing headwinds from new supply have resulted in a depressed stock price for the apartment REIT. The 4.8% dividend yield is near its highest levels in a decade, suggesting the stock is attractively priced right now. Although there's no quick fix for all the problems facing UDR, the fact that management has taken its technology skills and put them to work around retention is a sign of the company's strength and long-term focus."", ""Assuming it can get back on par with its peers with this effort, retention will no longer be the problem it is today and investors will be rewarded with a more stable business. That's worth watching if you own this REIT. It might even be worth taking the risk and buying the REIT if you don't own it, given the historically high yield and the opportunity that solving the turnover problem offers."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in UDR right now?', 'Before you buy stock in UDR, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and UDR wasn't one of them.

And first up, Lennar, shares of that are falling here this morning off just about 2% shortly after the open. The company reporting its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Thursday."", ""Now, despite beating the Street's expectations on revenue and earnings on steady demand for deliveries, the homebuilder reported a gross margin that missed analysts' expectations. Also, the gross margin forecast for the fiscal first quarter came in a bit weaker than expected. We're seeing that reflected in the share price action today under a bit of pressure."", ""We also got to point out, though, that Lennar went into this report with shares at an all time high. So we're seeing a bit of a pullback there. We have seen a lot of this momentum here play out within many of these homebuilder stocks. New home sales have really helped steady maybe a struggling housing market here over the last several months."", ""We have seen a bid here just because of the fact that so many existing homeowners, they aren't moving from their homes because they're locked in at lower rates that's leaving home builders, the new home sales to really pick up that demand that's still remains out there. So we have seen a bid for these homebuilders in this environment. Of course, a lot of that future momentum hinges on the fact of whether or not we're going to see an improvement on the mortgage rates. We have the 30-year mortgage just above 7% So a bit of improvement in terms of the highs that we saw about two months ago, but still much, much higher than what we saw play out during the pandemic."", ""BRAD SMITH: I mean, you hit the nail on the head with the mortgage rates also impacting the demand environment. And the thing that will make you say, golly gee willikers when you look at this report is the fact that the backlog, kind of, quarter over quarter here, you were taking a look at a backlog previously of about 21,000 homes, dollar value of about $9.9 billion. You take a look at this quarter, sure, they've moved through much of delivery on that, but the backlog now sitting at just south of 15,000 homes. Dollar value now sitting at $6.6 billion."", ""So what does that tell you? That tells you that there are not more buyers that are actively coming into this market and increasing that backlog that this company can then deliver on. So that is something that investors would look out to and say, OK, ultimately, where is that buying capacity going to come in from and what do the home sellers-- what do the home builders need to do in order to offset what some of those customers are going to be paying in the mortgage rates over an extended period of time with the real price that they're paying up front? And so that's where you're seeing more of that moderation perhaps even in pricing, even just to get some of the homes started as well."", ""SEANA SMITH: Yeah, we've seen many of these incentives, a lot of those--"", 'BRAD SMITH: Right, yeah.', ""SEANA SMITH: --just in terms of lowering prices. Yes, it is pressuring margins. But names like Lennar, they're taking that hit on the margin level trying at least to boost the volume of sales. It's enough for now. But whether or not that's going to be enough as you look ahead to 2024 and investors take a second look at some of the pressure that we are seeing on margins as a result here of some of those incentives that they're offering, you got to think it's going to pressure the stock at some point.""]"

Horton DHI has been reaping the benefits of the above-mentioned tailwind along with its solid acquisition strategies, increased homebuilding lots, decreasing cycle times and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points.Shares of this Arlington, TX-based homebuilder have gained 71.3% over the past year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 67.6% rise. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.2%, which highlights its inherent strength.However, rising land/labor and material costs and competitive pricing pressure remain concerns. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 60 days as analysts raised their estimates, depicting optimism over the stock’s growth potential. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has increased to $14.18 from $14.02.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Strategic Acquisitions and Enhanced Investments in Real Estate: D.R. Horton's growth strategy places significant emphasis on accretive acquisitions. The company has been swiftly acquiring homebuilding entities in sought-after markets. Notably, during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, there were no reported acquisitions.In July 2023, D.R. Horton successfully acquired the homebuilding operations of Truland Homes, operating in Baldwin County, Alabama, and Northwest Florida, for an approximate sum of $100 million in cash. The acquired assets encompass around 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots, and a sales order backlog of 55 homes. Additionally, the acquisition includes approximately 660 additional lots through land purchase contracts.For fiscal 2023, the company's investments in homebuilding, including lots, land, and development, amounted to $8 billion for the quarter, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase.Improving Macro Scenario: The housing outlook is becoming more positive as we head into the New Year, with limited availability of existing homes for sale and improving mortgage rates. Notably, as the inflation rate displays indications of easing and the economy remains stable, the Federal Open Market Committee's unanimous decision to sustain the benchmark within a targeted range of 5.25%-5.5% offers stability for homebuilders. Furthermore, members of the Federal Open Market Committee have suggested the possibility of rate cuts in the upcoming year.Affordable Homes: The company’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of its closings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. For first-quarter fiscal 2024 and the full fiscal year, our model predicts net sales orders to grow 33.4% to 17,857 units and 16.1% to 90,990 units, respectively, year over year."", 'Pressure on Margins: Escalating land and labor costs pose a threat to margins, constraining the pricing leverage of homebuilders. Labor shortages are resulting in increased wages, and limited availability is driving up land prices. Simultaneously, significant cost pressures from finished lots, skilled labor, and rising material costs (excluding lumber) may impact margins across all key regions.In fiscal 2023, homebuilding Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses saw a 2.4% year-over-year increase, with the SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues reaching 7.1%, marking a 30 basis points (bps) rise from the previous year. For fiscal 2023, the consolidated pre-tax profit margin contracted 500 bps to 17.8% compared with the prior-year period. This decline is attributed to a 520 bps decrease in the home sales gross margin and a 30 bps increase in homebuilding SG&A expenses (as a percentage of revenues).', 'EMCOR Group, Inc.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Principal Financial Group's  ROE today."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Principal Financial Group is:', '14% = US$1.6b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Principal Financial Group's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Principal Financial Group's moderate 20% growth over the past five years amongst other factors."", ""We then compared Principal Financial Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 9.0% in the same 5-year period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PFG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Principal Financial Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 38% (or a retention ratio of 62%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.', ""Moreover, Principal Financial Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 35%. Still, forecasts suggest that Principal Financial Group's future ROE will drop to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""On the whole, we feel that Principal Financial Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Eaton ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Eaton has managed to grow EPS by 30% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Eaton shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 14% to 16% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$212m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Eaton's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Eaton's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Of course, just because Eaton is growing does not mean it is undervalued.

It is important to note, however, that insider sells can be motivated by various factors, including diversification of personal portfolios, tax planning, or liquidity needs, and do not always reflect a negative outlook on the company's future."", ""The GF Value image provides a visual representation of the stock's valuation relative to its intrinsic value. The current price-to-GF-Value ratio above 1 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium to its estimated fair value, which could suggest that the market is optimistic about the company's growth prospects, despite the insider selling trend."", ""Director Bonnie Bassler's recent sale of shares in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc is a transaction that warrants attention, especially in the context of the broader insider selling trend and the company's valuation metrics. While the price-earnings ratio suggests the stock might be undervalued based on earnings, the price-to-GF-Value ratio indicates a modest overvaluation. Investors should consider these factors, along with the company's strong business fundamentals and growth potential, when making investment decisions. As always, insider trading is just one piece of the puzzle, and a comprehensive analysis should include a review of the company's financial health, market position, and future outlook."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.
