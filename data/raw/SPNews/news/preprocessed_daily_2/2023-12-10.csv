So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2023 Texas Instruments had debt of US$11.2b, up from US$7.94b in one year. However, it does have US$8.95b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$2.27b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Texas Instruments had liabilities of US$2.65b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.4b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.95b in cash and US$1.98b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$4.08b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Given Texas Instruments has a humongous market capitalization of US$142.6b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""Texas Instruments's net debt is only 0.26 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 24.6 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Texas Instruments if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 27% cut to EBIT over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Texas Instruments can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Texas Instruments recorded free cash flow worth 55% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Texas Instruments's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. Considering this range of data points, we think Texas Instruments is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether CF Industries Holdings' current trading price of US$76.56 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at CF Industries Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings ', 'Good news, investors! CF Industries Holdings is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $100.80, but it is currently trading at US$76.56 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, CF Industries Holdings’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of CF Industries Holdings, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? Although CF is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to CF, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CF for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision.

However, California is the largest producer of agricultural products in the nation. Corn, wheat, soybeans, and cotton are significant crops in the national economy. The combined acreage planted to these crops has increased to 242 million acres in 2022. The fruit and tree nut value of production has also experienced a steady rise. Prominent fruits in this regard include apples, grapes, strawberries, and oranges while tomatoes and potatoes dominate among the vegetables.', 'In 2023, a favorable spring season resulted in increased production of apples and sweet cherries in the Pacific Northwest. While winter and spring rainfall in California helped drought conditions, inadequate chill hours led to a decline in the production of peaches, tart cherries, and cranberries in several states. The US citrus production has also decreased due to a reduction in orange production in Florida. The lower citrus acreage and yields in Florida can be attributed to the effects of Huanglongbing, a bacterial disease that impacts citrus trees negatively. The aftereffects of Hurricane Ian also disrupted the production.', 'Simultaneously, soybeans recorded higher yields in Wisconsin, Tennessee, Ohio, North Dakota, and South Dakota. During September, US soybean processors processed 174.8 million bushels of soybeans, a record high for the month. However, rainfall and heavy snowstorms across the Northern Plains and Midwest regions slowed harvest activities at the end of October.', 'The US agriculture sector is subject to issues of rising production costs, climate change, and labor shortages. However, the transformation of farming through digitalization and automation of agricultural practices tends to be an effective solution. Yield maps, soil maps, and variable rate technologies (VRT) have helped improve corn and soybean acreage in the country. Automated guidance has also been increasingly applied on acreage planted to major crops including corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and winter wheat.', 'As reported by the US Department of Agriculture, American farmers, ranchers, and private forest landowners are supported through financial assistance and one-on-one technical advice. Nutrient management plays a significant role in improving agriculture by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act has dedicated an additional $19.5 billion from 2023 to 2027 which will help farmers implement expanded conservation practices to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase storage of carbon in their soil and trees.', 'Companies improving agricultural conditions in the United States include AGCO Corporation (NYSE:AGCO), CF Industries Holdings Inc.

This acquisition is a strategic addition to the firm’s precision agriculture capabilities. The company has also committed to having a full line of autonomous solutions for every stage of the crop cycle by 2030.', 'CF Industries Holdings Inc.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Huntington Bancshares investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.62 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Huntington Bancshares has a trailing yield of 5.2% on the current stock price of $11.99. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Huntington Bancshares paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year.', ""Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Huntington Bancshares, with earnings per share up 8.4% on average over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Huntington Bancshares has delivered an average of 15% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Should investors buy Huntington Bancshares for the upcoming dividend? Huntington Bancshares has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. In summary, Huntington Bancshares appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it."", ""So while Huntington Bancshares looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

By that, I’m referring to public companies that provide passive income while also benefiting from the top rating possible among covering analysts.', 'Fundamentally, dividend players should represent a key portion of your portfolio regardless of outside circumstances. When it comes to betting on the market, it’s a numbers game. Despite what you may hear from equity gurus, the reality is that losses on Wall Street are inevitable. However, target enough quality enterprises and you should win out in the long run. That’s the allure of strong-buy dividend stocks.', 'However, current circumstances invigorate the concept of passive income. Despite strong sales from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, consumer sentiment has been fading in recent months. Obviously, that’s a contradictory sign that warrants closer examination. Also, major corporations have announced layoffs, which doesn’t speak to robust upside in the future.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be fair, nobody knows what’s going to happen in the future but that’s also the point. Heading into the unknown, you’ll probably want these strong-buy dividend stocks.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/shutterstock.com', 'At first glance, KBR (NYSE:KBR) might not seem that appealing as a candidate for strong-buy dividend stocks. Looking at its financials, nothing truly distinctive pops up. It has ho-hum stability in the balance sheet while its long-term revenue trend runs a bit below sector average. And I can’t say it’s consistently profitable either. So, what does an investor get for the forward earnings of 14.4X, which is a modest premium?', 'In my opinion, relevance. According to its public profile, KBR operates in the fields of sciences, technology and engineering. Further, it brings solutions to multiple markets, including aerospace, industrial, intelligence and defense. And it’s this latter point that may appeal to patient investors. With the geopolitical environment spiraling, demand for defense-related products and services will likely rise.', 'Now, rising would not be a term I would use for KBR’s forward dividend yield of 1.05%. That’s quite low compared to the sector average 2.36%. However, analysts rate KBR a unanimous strong buy with a $69.67 average price target. Thus, the capital gains potential could make up for the low yield.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Compared to KBR above, Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW) more immediately makes an enticing case for strong-buy dividend stocks. For one thing, shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 14.1X. In contrast, the sector median stat lands at 19.14X. And it’s not a powderpuff figure either. For example, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate lands at 12.6%, above 68.51% of its peers.', 'Also, another important factor is that the enterprise – a food-processing company – is consistently profitable. In the past year, Lamb Weston’s operating and net margins hit 17.8% and 17.18%, respectively. Both stats run far higher than the underlying sector average. In turn, the food specialist pays a dividend but it’s not that much: only a forward yield of 1.15%.', 'Nevertheless, one could look at this matter optimistically and point to the ultra-low payout ratio of 17.87%. However, I like to think that relevance plays a part in the narrative. Basically, discretionary spending may fall in favor of the necessities.', 'Analysts also peg LW a unanimous strong buy with a $128.80 average price target.', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top tech firms in the world, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a multinational designer, developer, manufacturer and global supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Per its public profile, the company serves the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage and industrial sectors. While tech plays tend to be volatile in downcycles, Broadcom offers a wide range of relevancies.', 'Another factor that plays into AVGO’s case as one of the strong-buy dividend stocks is the robust profitability. Over the past decade, Broadcom printed net income in nine of the years. Also, it prints a robust operating margin of 45.69%. That’s more than 98% above the median for the semiconductor industry. And wouldn’t you know it, AVGO trades at 21X forward earnings, which is a slight discount.', 'As for the topic at hand, AVGO offers a forward yield of 1.96%. That’s better than the top two but not by very much. Still, the other point is that analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a max target of $1,200.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Specializing in advanced tech components, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) manufactures microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP (internet protocol) integrated circuits. Additionally, Microchip offers a broad spectrum of products, including embedded security and radio frequency (RF) devices. If you’re thinking that other investors recognize the relevancy here, you’re right. Since the January opener, MCHP gained 21% of equity value.', 'Of course, that’s not nearly as stratospheric as some of the other tech plays we’ve seen. Nevertheless, the company benefits from its candidacy as one of the top strong-buy dividend stocks. While it lacks the pizzazz of the heavily hyped names, the company symbolizes a busy stagehand. It might not be the star but it’s important to the ecosystem. Also, it trades at a discounted 15.82X forward earnings.', 'As a passive income provider, Microchip unsurprisingly enjoys consistent profitability. Now, the reward isn’t that high but it’s decent at 2.12%. Keep in mind that the tech sector’s average yield is only 1.37%. Simultaneously, analysts peg MCHP a strong buy with a high-side target of $110.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Pasadena, California, Dine Brands Global (NYSE:DIN) is a food and beverage company. Found in 1958 as IHOP, it operates franchised and corporate owned full-service restaurants: Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill & Bar, Fuzzy’s Taco Shop and the aforementioned IHOP. While the company offers relevance as a low-cost leader in the eating establishment industry, it also faces uncertainties.', 'Essentially, consumers are still struggling against the dual headwinds of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Adding to the woes, the previously mentioned mass layoffs don’t help instill confidence. So, it’s not particularly surprising that DIN stock incurred red ink this year. However, the steepness of the decline seems rather harsh, possibly making a case for itself among strong-buy dividend stocks.', 'For starters, DIN trades at a lowly 6.88X forward earnings. For context, the sector median comes in at 18.37X. Nevertheless, the company enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 2.7% (above 62% of its peers). And it also supports a much higher-than-average net margin of 9.07%.', 'In closing, the forward yield lands at 4.7% while analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $59 target.', 'Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock', 'Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Independence Realty Trust (NYSE:IRT) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). Per its website, the company owns and operates multifamily apartment properties across the country. In particular, it focuses on non-gateway (non-primary) U.S. markets, including Atlanta, Louisville, Memphis and Raleigh. On paper, Independence appears relevant as many young people have moved to the areas the company covers for cost-of-living reasons.', 'Still, IRT presents high risks for speculators. Since the start of the year, IRT lost 18% of equity value. That’s steep considering the core relevance of the underlying narrative – you’ve got to live somewhere. Still, the major positive is business predictability. Since 2010, the company has consistently witnessed consecutive annual sales growth.', 'In Q3, Independence posted revenue of $168.6 million, up 5% against the prior-year quarter. So, it appears that 2023 will represent a continuation of the trend. For passive income, it carries a forward yield of 4.73%. Now, the payout ratio is high at 205.13% but REITs generally tend to run hotter-than-average metrics.', 'Lastly, analysts peg IRT a unanimous strong buy with a $17.83 price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, Runway Growth Finance (NASDAQ:RWAY) bills itself as a growing specialty finance company focused on providing flexible capital solutions to late-stage and growth companies seeking an alternative to raising equity. By no means should you consider RWAY as an easy opportunity among strong-buy dividend stocks. Analysts do like it but that’s where much of the encouraging news ends.', 'Presently, the company carries a market capitalization of $509 million. Given the headwinds in the broader economy, Runway could face difficulties in its stated directives. To be fair, RWAY is trending along modestly right now, with shares up 4% in the trailing 52 weeks. Still, with the unpredictability of financing growth endeavors, the forward trajectory remains questionable.', 'Additionally, Runway enjoys solid long-term revenue growth. Also, RWAY trades at a forward earnings multiple of 6.15X, below the sector median 7.82X. Where I’m getting a bit skeptical is its forward yield. At 12.67%, that’s tempting but maybe too tempting.', 'However, the company enjoys a consensus strong buy rating among top-tier analysts.

Lula! Lula!” many onlookers screamed during Lula’s many events at COP27 in Egypt.', 'What a difference a year makes.', 'Just as Lula addressed world leaders at COP28 in Dubai, it was announced that Brazil would join OPEC+, a group of big oil-exporting countries, including Russia. At one event during the conference, Lula tried to explain the decision by saying that, once on the inside, the South American nation would push other oil-producing countries to transition to green energy—a curious explanation given that state-run oil company Petrobras is focused on further oil exploration.

It's part of a push to offer more than 900 blocks in December."", 'In a written response to the AP, the National Agency of Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuels declined to comment on demands for energy transition, arguing that, as a regulatory agency, it “does not create public policies but rather implements the policies formulated by the government.""', ""The increased exploration, which eventually leads to more production, threatens to cancel out or even surpass gains from Brazil's efforts to stop net deforestation by 2030, according to the Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimation System, an initiative by the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups."", '“The damage (of the exploration) goes against any positioning of Brazil as a climate leader,"" said David Tsai, projects coordinator at the Institute for Energy and the Environment, which is part of Climate Observatory.', 'While Lula fumbled during the few days he spent at COP28, his Colombian counterpart, leftist Gustavo Petro, seemed to be taking the mantle of environmental leadership in Latin America.

Lula and other leaders vetoed Petro’s proposal to ban oil production in the world’s largest rainforest. Similar to the ongoing climate talks, oil was the most contentious topic during the meeting held in Belem. At the time, Lula faced protests by Indigenous groups and environmentalists against Petrobras’ plans to explore for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River."", ""Petrobras did not respond to AP's written request for comment on its plans for the mouth of Amazon and on energy transition.

Research (kind of) proves him right,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-thinks-better-boss-123000784.html,1702125000,STORY,"['TSLA', 'MSFT']","['“Elon pushes hard, maybe too much.”', 'That testimony may read like an anonymous Blind post from a disgruntled, strung-out worker laboring under the bombastic CEO Elon Musk at Tesla, X (formerly Twitter), or SpaceX. But it actually came from billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates.', 'Every manager has a different leadership style, he said during a fireside chat this week at the Economic Club of New York, which had just honored him with the Peter G. Peterson Leadership Excellence Award. “Elon pushes hard, maybe too much,"" Gates said, first reported by Business Insider. Even the late Steve Jobs—the genius and notoriously thankless manager who co-founded Apple—in Gates’ opinion, did the same.', 'As for Gates himself? ""I think of myself as very nice compared to those guys,” he said, though he admitted to some micromanaging tendencies of his own.', 'Naturally, there’s more to the story. In order to lead a supremely innovative company—like Musk’s Tesla, Jobs’ Apple, and, yes, Gates’ former Microsoft—Gates acknowledged that “hardcore” leadership is often necessary. That’s where he sets himself apart from Musk, about whom he has often expressed public disapproval.', 'At the fireside, Gates said he tempers his own leadership instincts by viewing everything through “an innovation lens,” but admits that wasn’t always his approach.', 'Indeed, Gates’ leadership in the early Microsoft days was defined by a short fuse. According to a 1993 biography, Gates often sent “critical and sarcastic” midnight emails to workers, including one in which he harangued a programmer for submitting “the stupidest piece of code ever written.”', 'Employees at the time called the Gates-led Microsoft “confrontational,” “demanding,” and “intense.” Gates has softened over time, and is now known for a leadership style that embraces feedback and employee input.', 'Musk seems not to have learned Gates’ lessons, and remains avowedly more focused on cultivating a cutthroat culture. Last year, days after buying the company, Musk infamously sent a 2 a.m. email to the entire Twitter employee base instructing them to be “extremely hardcore” and to work “long hours at high intensity.” At Musk-run Twitter—pre-X—he added, “only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.” That’s not just lip service; Musk himself is a notoriously hard worker who has been known to sleep at Tesla’s factories.', 'Of course, Gates might have some beef. Microsoft and Apple are notorious competitors, and he and Musk have exchanged words in the past. While Gates may not agree with Musk’s leadership style, Musk has been decidedly more open about his distaste for Gates as a person.', 'Following a business slight—Gates shorting his Tesla stock—Musk was “super mean,” Gates told Musk biograhper Walter Isaacson. Musk, on the other hand, appears to have little concern about issuing ad hominem attacks. He has loudly insulted Gates’ intelligence and even denigrated his appearance. Last year, he tweeted a photo of Gates with a side-by-side of a pregnant emoji.', 'Plus, per Isaacson, Musk reportedly took Gates’ lack of support for Tesla as a betrayal of his values. “How can someone say they are passionate about fighting climate change and then do something that reduces the overall investment in the company doing the most?” Musk reportedly wondered aloud.', 'He refused to work with Gates from there on—even on charitable initiatives. “At this point, I am convinced that [Gates] is categorically insane (and an asshole to the core),” Musk told Isaacson. “I did actually want to like him (sigh).”', 'They also disagree on one of Musk’s prime ambitions: Life on Mars. “I’m not a Mars person,” Gates told Musk’s biographer. “He’s overboard on Mars.”', 'But Gates’ gripe that Musk (and Jobs) pushed “too hard” is valid if you consult research. Giving workers the space and confidence to do their best work—where, when, and how it appeals to them—is the best way to ensure enduring efficiency. Insane amounts of pressure tend to only worsen morale and performance—a recent Slack survey of 10,000 workers finds that workers who feel obliged to work late report 20% lower productivity during the day. And toxic, abusive bosses end up sending their most ambitious workers right out the door first, finds a group of researchers from the Stevens Institute of Technology and University of Illinois Chicago.', 'That might make Gates the better boss. So much for ""hardcore.""', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Among primary care options, Family Medicine and Internal Medicine are generally considered easiest medical specialties to study, with relatively shorter residencies compared to some other specialities. Moreover, Emergency Medicine is the medical speciality that takes the least amount of time.\xa0', 'It is also worth mentioning that programs in primary care specialities like Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics are some of the easiest specialities to match into for International Medical Graduates (IMGs).

Despite the US spending more per capita on healthcare than other developed countries, the survey of approximately 2,500 adults, conducted from February to March 2023, highlighted widespread dissatisfaction. More than half of respondents graded the US healthcare system a ""C"" or below, citing factors such as high costs (the most common criticism), profit-driven focus, insurance inaccessibility, and confusion about coverage. Notably, 44% admitted to skipping or delaying needed care in the past two years, with 40% attributing it to costs.', ""Interestingly, amid these challenges, the survey identified some positive sentiments. Over 75% of participants noted that providers collaborate to improve their health, 70% expressed a desire for stronger relationships with their healthcare providers, and more than 65% believed regular engagement with a trusted provider could improve their health. Despite frustrations, these responses suggest a nuanced perspective on the healthcare system's potential improvement. However, these issues do not stop here."", 'A recent survey by the Commonwealth Fund also revealed alarming trends in American healthcare, with around 79 million Americans (41% working-age Americans) facing medical bill issues in the past year. Shockingly, this rate is the highest among nine developed countries analyzed. Even high-income Americans are almost as likely as lower-income individuals in other nations to defer healthcare due to costs, with 29% admitting to skipping or delaying care. This places the US at a disadvantage, especially considering that other developed countries with universal health coverage exhibit significantly lower rates of delayed or skipped care among high-income populations, ranging from 6% to 16%.', 'As the fall and winter seasons approach, health officials are anticipating a challenging period with a potential increase in viral illnesses, including influenza, COVID-19, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with the highest energy consumption.', 'When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the global economy was impacted, though no industry was impacted more than the energy sector. Russia is one of the biggest suppliers of oil and natural gas in the world, and Europe has traditionally been heavily dependent on Russian supplies, despite political tensions preceding the invasion and subsequent war. Even though European countries are attempting to move away from fossil fuel usage to renewable energy, 70% of its total energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. While Europe, which is home to some of the countries with the highest energy consumption, is a heavily energy dependent region, it relies mostly on imports, with around 40% of its natural gas needs coming from Russia alone. In 2019, before the pandemic impacted the global economy, world electricity consumption per day was 1,904 TWh.', 'An aerial view of an energy refinery, with massive tanks and piping defining the landscape.', 'In a bid to dissuade Russia from further aggression with Ukraine and as a punishment for activities already undertaken by it, Western countries, led by the U.S., implemented heavy sanctions on Russia, which also provides nearly half of all coal imports in the EU and 27% of oil imports in the region. While Europe has been attempting to move away from Russian oil and gas supply, having announced the intention of moving away completely from Russian supplies by 2027, it has faced significant issues, leading to a major energy crisis, which was one of the biggest global risks for 2023. Lack of supplies from Russia led to the price of energy increasing significantly and allowing major oil and gas companies, including some of the biggest oil companies in the world, to post their highest profits ever. While prices dropped in 2023 as compared to the peak achieved in 2022, there are still several challenges awaiting the countries with the highest energy consumption.', 'In an attempt to move away from Russia, top European companies signed contracts with Qatar for the supply of LNG, with one such deal including a a 27 year contract entered into by TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). In the current year, the share price of TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) has increased by more than 8%.', 'Aristotle Capital Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“TotalEnergies SE\xa0(NYSE:TTE), one of the world’s largest energy companies, was also a primary contributor for the quarter. The company continues to execute on its strategic plan to reach net‐zero emissions by 2050 which, in contrast to many European energy providers, it looks to achieve through expanding ownership of renewable power and low‐carbon assets rather than purely divestment. The company expects to more than double its gross renewable generation capacity by 2025 (primarily in solar) and invest over 30% of its total spending in low‐carbon businesses through 2030. As such, we believe TotalEnergies is uniquely positioned to benefit from the increase in global demand for clean energy. In recent years, TotalEnergies’ reduction in capex and operating expenses has improved its FREE cash flow generation, now further aided by the favorable energy environment. This has supported its continued ability to return cash to shareholders, one of our catalysts, as demonstrated by the $3.8 billion returned through share buybacks and dividends during the second quarter.”', 'However, TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) mentioned recently that if needed, the company could divert natural gas from Qatar to non-European companies if it benefited Qatar and the company. ""I don\'t see (how) you could manage complex power electricity markets in Europe with a lot of renewables without having flexible assets,"" TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) CEO Pouyanne said.', 'Renewable energy sector future outlook', 'The war with Russia may have accelerated it but the world, and particularly the Western world, has been moving towards renewable energy to mitigate and reverse the impact of climate change already being felt. In 2022, headwinds in the sector resulted in renewable energy growth slowing down in 2022, particularly in the U.S. Inflation has played a major role in this as costs have risen significantly and supply chain disruptions along with uncertainty with respect to trade policy and higher borrowing costs have all created obstacles to progress for the renewable energy sector. Luckily for the highest energy consuming countries in the world, demand has soared in 2023 though this could further complicate and intensify supply chain issues already present resulting in even higher prices. According to BDO, by 2024, around a third of global electricity will be produced through renewable sources and unsurprisingly, the countries with the highest energy consumption overall is in China, which was the most populous country in the world until a few month ago before being overtaken by India.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with highest solar energy generation per capita.', ""2022's energy crisis didn't just impact the non-renewable sector but spilled over to the renewable sector as well. While the global focus has been shifting towards renewable resources for several years now, especially in advanced economies which dominate the list of countries with highest solar energy generation per capita, the oil price shock renewed debate in greater investment in oil production capacity to control its price. Of course, this has a negative impact on renewable energy production since funds will have to be cut from one sector and provided to the other. The U.S., one of the countries with the largest oil reserves, has already significantly increased oil production, even as OPEC+ countries agreed to reduce their output, and is now producing more oil than even Saudi Arabia. In 2022, American oil production was 11.9 million barrels per day, and according to the Energy Information Administration, in November 2023, daily production peaked at a record 13.2 million barrels per day."", ""An aerial view of a solar power plant, the sun's rays illuminating the surrounding landscape."", 'At the same time, tailwinds and headwinds are battling each other in the renewable energy sector, with a particular focus on the countries with highest solar energy generation per capita, and in 2022, renewable energy growth in the U.S. slowed down as supply chain disruptions and increased costs impacted production. Other factors negatively impacting solar power generation and growth are uncertainties in trade policy, higher interest rates and record inflation, many of which will continue to create headwinds in 2023.', 'On the other hand, the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. has created a pathway for strong growth for renewable energy considering the incentives present in the Act, not to mention higher demand. A negative in this aspect is the fact that higher demand could also create further bottlenecks in the immediate future, though this will likely be offset as the trend of increased clean energy component manufacturing continues to take place.', 'In 2022, some of the biggest renewable energy companies in Europe, along with those in the rest of the world, helped deploy 239 GW of new solar capacity, the most in any one year, as alternatives to oil have gained increased importance amid lower dependence in Russia. This meant an annual growth rate of over 45%, another fantastic achievement and one which bodes well for the solar generation sector and the companies involved in it. Currently, total installed solar generation capacity is around 1.2 TW, 25% higher than in 2021, and cross the milestone of 1 TW in 2022. Among all renewable energy, solar energy is easily the most dominant thanks to the countries with the highest solar energy generation per capita, and almost two-thirds of all new renewable energy is solar.', 'Currently, one of the biggest renewable energy companies in the world is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), with a market cap greater than $100 billion. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) also called out the potential of solar energy in the company\'s future energy production and improvement in supply chain which me called out earlier as a challenge, and mentioned in its Q3 2023 earnings call ""So, first of all, with supply chain, things are really improved a lot. As Rebecca just mentioned, we have the two issues, right? CERC convention, which has been asked and answered, provided a lot of clarity around what can be done, what can\'t, and with the presidential proclamation. So, in very good shape there. Second was forced labor and making sure that our suppliers are working constructively with Customs and Border Patrol to get their panels cleared for importation into the country. And so, for the most part, all of our solar suppliers have been able to do that. And so, we are in very good shape there. I think on grid power, I actually -- the grid-level issues that you just mentioned, we\'re in very good shape on. We had gone long on grid-level equipment, including transformers. And so, we have a significant supply in our inventory. And we\'ve also looked forward in a plan for this in terms of trying to make sure that we have equipment available where if our customers or the transmission owner in the places that we\'re building renewables are short on equipment, are short on grid-level equipment in particular, that we have it in our inventory and are able to offer that up as a solution.""', 'Despite being one of the top companies in a fast growing industry and despite improvement in solar production in the countries with the highest solar generation per capita, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has seen its stock price fall by more than 30% in 2023, as interest rate pressures among other factors have impacted its future earnings outlook.', 'Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Although NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) reported an in-line second quarter, the stock has been weak primarily because of rising interest rates. NextEra also reported slower renewables backlog growth than expected. We do not view this as an issue as we expect the development pipeline timeline may not be as predictable as investors would like. The environment for renewables remains favorable both from a demand perspective as well as cost perspective.”', ""While renewables energy companies have hit a rough patch recently, there can be no doubting the potential of the industry, and in H1 2023, global renewable energy investment stood at $358 billion, a growth of 22% from the previous year, with this increase coming mainly from growing venture capital financing. Of this $358 billion, $239 billion was allocated to the solar energy sector, with investments being high particularly in China, followed by the U.S., and you'll have to read on to figure out whether they feature among the countries with the highest solar energy generation per capita.

This is because of the fact that European laws focus more on consumer rights as opposed to corporations, unlike the U.S., where capitalism ensures that corporations can grow unfettered.

(NYSE: PFE) today presented results from the pivotal Phase 3 BASIS clinical trial (NCT03938792) evaluating marstacimab for the treatment of people with severe hemophilia A and moderately severe to severe hemophilia B without inhibitors to Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX). The results from the BASIS trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate (ABR). The findings were presented today at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in San Diego.', '""For more than five decades, the most common treatment for hemophilia A and B has been intravenous infusions that are often administered multiples times per week,""1 said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer, Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Research and Development, Pfizer. ""Based on these results and if approved, we believe marstacimab could offer a subcutaneous option with a compelling combination of efficacy and safety that may significantly reduce the risk of bleeding. We look forward to potentially bringing this treatment option to people living with hemophilia A and B without inhibitors.""', 'In the BASIS trial, 116 people living with hemophilia were treated with marstacimab during a 12-month active treatment period (ATP) versus a routine prophylaxis (RP) and on-demand (OD) intravenous regimen with FVIII or FIX, administered as part of usual care in a six-month observational period. Marstacimab, a novel, investigational anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI), was administered weekly with flat (not weight-based) dosing as a subcutaneous 300 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg once weekly. The study found:', 'Compared to RP, treatment with marstacimab resulted in a 35.2% mean reduction (95% CI: 5.6-55.6; p=0.0376) in ABR over 12 months (mean of 7.85 [5.09-10.61] to 5.08 [3.40-6.77]).', 'Marstacimab significantly reduced ABR by 91.6% (95% CI: 88.1-94.1; p<0.0001) compared to OD over 12 months (mean of 38.00 [31.03-46.54] to 3.18 [2.09-4.85]).', 'The mean ABR reductions observed with marstacimab were consistent across hemophilia A and B and age groups for OD and were generally consistent across hemophilia A and B and age groups for RP, with all point estimates for a difference <2.5 (non-inferiority margin for the ABR of treated bleeds).', 'Following 12 months in the ATP, patients had the option to continue receiving marstacimab in the long-term extension (LTE) study. In the LTE, a consistent reduction in ABR compared to OD (mean ABR of 3.86 [2.02-7.37]) and further numerical reduction compared to RP (mean ABR of 2.27 [1.40-3.67]) were observed after up to an additional 16 months of follow-up (n=87).', 'In the OD group, superiority (p<0.0001) of marstacimab was demonstrated across all bleeding-related secondary endpoints - spontaneous bleeds, joint bleeds, target joint bleeds, and total bleeds. In the RP group, marstacimab demonstrated non-inferiority to these secondary efficacy endpoints.', 'Health-related quality of life parameters showed non-significant improvements vs OD therapy and non-inferiority versus RP therapy.', 'The safety profile for marstacimab was consistent with Phase 1/2 results and treatment was generally well-tolerated. No deaths were reported and there have been no thromboembolic events or events of consumptive coagulopathy recorded in hemophilia patients in clinical trials investigating marstacimab. The most commonly reported adverse events of special interest among patients treated with marstacimab in BASIS and the LTE (≥5% of patients) were COVID-19, hemorrhage, hepatic disorder, hypersensitivity, hypertension and injection site reaction. One treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) was observed (peripheral swelling), and one patient discontinued from the trial due to a non-treatment-related SAE.', '""Recognizing the uncertainty that living with hemophilia can present for patients, the results from the BASIS trial are particularly encouraging as reductions in ABR were seen in the 12-month treatment period and then retained in long-term follow-up,"" said Davide Matino, M.D., M.Sc., Assistant Professor of Medicine, McMaster University. ""Based on these results, marstacimab has shown the potential to address the diverse needs of appropriate patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors with weekly subcutaneous administration in a flat dose that is not weight-based, and with low monitoring requirements.""', 'Pfizer currently has three Phase 3 programs investigating novel treatment options for people living with hemophilia. In addition to the BASIS study, fidanacogene elaparvovec and giroctocogene fitelparvovec are investigational gene therapy treatments being studied for the treatment of adults living with hemophilia B and hemophilia A, respectively. Updated data from both gene therapy programs, including an oral presentation of four-year results from Pfizer’s Phase 1/2 study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec in adults living with severe hemophilia A, will be presented at the ASH meeting.', 'About the BASIS study', 'BASIS is a global Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study evaluating ABR through 12 months of treatment with marstacimab, an investigational, novel subcutaneous therapy option, in approximately 145 adolescent and adult participants ages 12 to <75 years with severe hemophilia A (defined as FVIII <1%) or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (defined as FIX activity ≤2%) with or without inhibitors. Approximately 15% of participants are adolescents (ages 12 to <18 years old). This study is comparing treatment with a run-in period for patients prescribed factor replacement therapy or bypass therapy during a six-month observational period with a 12-month ATP, during which participants receive prophylaxis (a 300 mg subcutaneous loading dose of marstacimab, followed by 150 mg subcutaneously once weekly) with potential for dose escalation to 300 mg once weekly.', 'The inhibitor cohort of the BASIS trial has completed enrollment and is expected to read out as early as late 2024. Pfizer is also conducting BASIS KIDS, an open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of marstacimab in children 1 to <18 years of age with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors. The study will compare 12 months of historical standard treatment to marstacimab prophylaxis.', 'About Marstacimab', 'Marstacimab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G isotype, subclass 1 (IgG1) that targets the Kunitz 2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a natural anticoagulation protein that functions to prevent the formation of blood clots. Marstacimab is in development as a prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in individuals with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors.', 'About Hemophilia', 'Hemophilia is a family of rare genetic blood diseases caused by a clotting factor deficiency (FVIII in hemophilia A, FIX in hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting. Hemophilia is diagnosed in early childhood and impacts more than 400,000 people worldwide.2 The inability of the blood to clot properly can increase the risk of painful bleeding inside the joints, which can cause joint scarring and damage. People living with hemophilia can suffer permanent joint damage following repeated bleeding episodes.1,2', 'For decades, the most common treatment approach for hemophilia A and B has been factor replacement therapy, which replaces the missing clotting factors. Factor replacement therapies increase the amount of clotting factor in the body to levels that improve clotting, resulting in less bleeding.3,4 Approximately 25%-30% of people with hemophilia A and 3%-5% of people with hemophilia B are unable to continue taking factor replacement therapies because they develop inhibitors to FVIII and FIX.5,6', 'In a survey of people in the U.S. receiving prophylaxis for hemophilia A or B, nearly one-third of those that receive treatment and have high compliance — defined as taking 75% or more of their prescribed infusions — stated that the time-consuming nature of prophylaxis was the most significant challenge of the regimen.7,8 Nearly 60% of those that took the less than the prescribed number of infusions reported that the time commitment was the primary reason for missing infusions.', 'About Pfizer: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ Lives', ""At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

On Friday, as researchers and doctors arrived here, the Food and Drug Administration approved two gene therapies for sickle cell disease, an inherited condition that for several years now has been a regular focus on the conference.', '“ASH 2023 is going to be marked by these two FDA approvals,” said Alexis Leonard, a hematologist and assistant faculty member at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\xa0“This is 10 years’ worth of clinical trial work and 30 years of basic science culminating in what happened yesterday.”', 'Both Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bluebird bio, respectively makers of the two therapies, are at ASH with updated data for their treatments, which will soon be available in the U.S. for people with sickle cell aged 12 years or older. For Bluebird,\xa0it’s the seventh year running that it has presented sickle cell data\xa0here.', 'While the approval news may be the biggest headline, there are many other studies of note, including one of CAR-T therapy in autoimmune disease and another highlighting the difference between the trial setting and the real world.', 'Could CAR-T cell therapy’s next application be in treating autoimmune disease? A small academic study in Germany is offering clues.', 'An initial slice of data, from the first five study participants, drew attention to the question last year. At ASH on Saturday, researchers led by Fabian Mueller of the Bavarian Cancer Research Institute presented new results from 15 patients with lupus or two other autoimmune diseases.', 'Their findings suggest CAR-T therapy, currently used for blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, could treat those immune conditions, too.', '""All [patients] remain in complete remission since we have treated them with CD19 CAR-T cells,” said Mueller, at an ASH press conference Saturday. “At least for now, it\'s a lasting remission.”', 'In a related statement, he shared how the first lupus patient treated with CAR-T in the trial was so sick at the time that she wasn’t expected to live much longer than a month. Now she’s running five days a week, he said.', 'The rationale for using CAR-T in autoimmune diseases has to do with how the treatments work. They consist of a patient’s own immune cells, engineered to target a protein called CD19 that’s typically found on the surface of B cell cancers. But it appears these souped-up cells can also destroy misfiring B cells that are responsible for the immune attack that inflammatory diseases like lupus inflict on the body.', 'So far, the 15 patients in the study have been followed for a median of 15 months after their CAR-T infusions. All are doing well and have stopped taking immunosuppressive drugs. Two-thirds experienced a mild form of cytokine release syndrome, an immune side effect of CAR-T therapy, but there were no serious treatment-related adverse events.', 'Mueller and his fellow researchers are hopeful their findings could lead to an alternative treatment to autologous stem cell transplant in people with life-threatening autoimmune diseases.', '“Of course we need longer follow-up to establish how effective the treatment is going to be in the long run,” said Mueller.', 'There are signs drugmakers are paying attention. A group of biotechnology companies are exploring whether a special type of immune cell called Tregs could be used for autoimmune cell therapies. And earlier this month, CRISPR Therapeutics, in a research pivot, said it was planning to test one of its experimental CAR-T therapies in lupus.', 'One potential hurdle? An investigation by the FDA into the possible risk of T cell malignancies in people who received CAR-T therapies for cancer. While the agency believes the benefits outweigh the risks, that balance might be different in autoimmune diseases.', 'Randomized clinical trials are the most powerful tool drug researchers have. Matching two groups of patients, assigning one an experimental therapy and the other a placebo or known treatment, can produce convincing answers about which medicines work and which don’t.', 'But as controlled experiments, they don’t always mirror patients’ reality. For instance, researchers might exclude certain people from a trial, such as those who are sicker, or only enroll people from a specific demographic group.', 'Alissa Visram, a doctor at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada, set out to study this issue, comparing the “efficacy” of multiple myeloma drug regimens in clinical trials to the “effectiveness” they actually had in the real world.', '“The criteria for clinical trial eligibility are often quite stringent, so the results are not always generalizable,” Visram said in a statement about research that will be presented at ASH Sunday.', 'Their findings are sobering. Among nearly 4,000 people with the blood cancer who were treated in Ontario, Canada, between 2007 and 2020, outcomes were markedly worse for six standard drug regimens than the respective marks in Phase 3 studies.', 'Median progression-free survival, a measure of how long until a person’s disease progresses or death, was between three and 18 months shorter in the real world than in trials, depending on the regimen. Median overall survival was at least 19 months shorter outside of clinical testing across the six treatments.', '“Understanding the effectiveness of treatments is important for policymakers who regulate the use of drugs, but also for patients and clinicians to make informed treatment decisions,” said Visram at a press conference held by ASH.', 'A seventh regimen, Bristol Myers Squibb’s Pomalyst with the steroid dexamethasone, actually performed better in the real world than in trials, Visram and her colleagues found.', '“We think that this is because this was the only regimen where the prior treatment exposures were comparable between the real world and trial controls,” Visram said at the press conference.', 'They didn’t design their research, which relied on public health records, to determine what caused the “efficacy-effectiveness” gap, but noted that, on average, people included in their real world analysis were older and had more comorbidities than those who were in the comparator trials.', 'People with sickle cell disease routinely face obstacles to receiving proper care, particularly during the acute pain crises they experience. Managing such crises can require emergency room treatment and strong painkillers like opioids, which doctors may misconstrue as drug seeking or be hesitant to prescribe.', 'To document some of those barriers, researchers at Pfizer turned to social media, parsing more than 45,000 posts on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok for conversations related to sickle cell.', 'Their findings may not be surprising, but the researchers describe their study as an innovative way to capture patients’ voices in a format where people are more likely to be candid.', '“If you were to ask patients about their sickle cell disease care in the clinic, it is likely you would get a filtered response,” Oliver Shastri, a rare disease team lead at Pfizer who led the research, said in an ASH statement.', 'Shastri and his colleagues worked with data analysts to mine social media posts by U.K. users for key search terms such as the disease name, treatments and hashtags, results from which they organized using a computer algorithm. They then validated and contextualized the resulting output manually.', 'Many of the posts showed patients experienced “a lack of empathy from healthcare providers” and discrimination in seeking care. Patient posts also expressed a sense that their symptoms were dismissed or underestimated by physicians.', ""“Social media listening offers a novel and quantifiable method of capturing the patient's digital voice, where traditionally gathering these insights was limited by geography or the high burden of administration,” Shastri said in the statement."", 'Pfizer sells one drug, Oxbryta, for sickle cell disease and is developing another, data for which was presented Saturday at ASH.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

Treading through choppy waters, the industry has finally recovered from the demand destruction caused by the pandemic and is estimated to have recovered to around 107% of the pre-COVID level, according to latest IATA figures. The global industry posted cumulative losses of nearly $180 billion over the 2020-2022 period and is on track to post a net profit of $23.3 billion in 2023 with revenues of $896 billion.', 'The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects travel demand to further increase in 2024 with revenues projected to grow at 7.6% year-on-year to a record $964 billion, 15% more than the pre-covid peak level in 2019. Several factors are expected to contribute to this growth, including significant increase in the number of flights expected to be available in 2024, at 40.1 million, compared to 36.8 million this year, as well as high demand for travel.', 'Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, made the following comments about the financial outlook for the industry:', '“Considering the major losses of recent years, the $25.7 billion net profit expected in 2024 is a tribute to aviation’s resilience. People love to travel and that has helped airlines to come roaring back to pre-pandemic levels of connectivity. The speed of the recovery has been extraordinary; yet it also appears that the pandemic has cost aviation about four years of growth.

It’s a legit good deal,” the undercover source insisted. “The 5% discount and 30-day return extension are game-changers.” Beyond simply financing purchases interest-free for 6-24 months, flashing plastic branded with Target’s bullseye unlocks exclusive perks easy to overlook. But leveraging their credit card also yields year-round savings and flexibility rivaling Target’s top competitors.', 'With old devices cluttering drawers, the insider indicated that Target accepts electronics trade-ins not just for environmental kudos, but actual monetary rewards. “Got old electronics lying around? Ask our electronics department about trading them in for a Target gift card,” they advised. “It’s a win-win.” So before dumping dusty gadgets and games at Goodwill, check their buyback potential at Target. Receiving discounts makes trashing tech much sweeter.', 'Also: 9 American Clothing Brands to Stay Away From Buying', 'Finding the steepest savings takes insider intel. “Want the best deals? Know the markdown schedule. Electronics on Mondays, clothing on Tuesdays,” the insider advised.', 'Rather than relying on luck in clearance aisles, memorize cycles of sale announcements oscillating between merchandise categories week-to-week. Then, time your shopping runs strategically. Ask an employee to share the schedule with you and you’ll be the first one to know where the deals are.', 'No one enjoys buyer’s remorse over items instantly marked down post-purchase. But according to our guide, Target’s price match policy provides a generous 14-day window allowing refunds on differences. “Frustrated with post-purchase discounts? No worries. Bring your receipt within 14 days and we’ll refund the difference. That’s our commitment to fairness.” Always keep your register receipts so you can take advantage of price adjustments should sales pop up.', 'Think Target maintains pricing consistency across its nearly 2,000 stores nationwide? Guess again, our candid staffer said. “Not all Targets are created equal. Prices can vary between locations, so it’s worth comparing to ensure you’re getting the best deal.” Checking online stock and values prior to store walks prevents overpaying at a given address. Why rush to checkout without scoping for superior savings just one town over?', 'Beyond brick-and-mortar bounty, our insider reminded us that checking online inventory can unlock additional exclusives. “Before you hit the store, check Target.com. Some items cost less online, and you can stack up on discounts using the Cartwheel app.” This also helps you make the most of shopping with coupon codes and loyalty points.', 'Think layering coupons seems extreme? Not so says our specialist, who encouraged stacking all available discounts simultaneously. “Combine, combine, combine! Whether it’s Target coupons, manufacturer’s coupons, or even ones from competitors — we love saving you money.” So don’t limit yourself to a single coupon or promo code per trip. Use as many as you can to make the most of price-slashing.', 'What could incentivize shopping beyond sheer savings? Cold hard gift card cash, said our insider. “Keep an eye on promotions like: spend $100 on select items and receive a free $20 gift card. Big sales days often come with bonus gift cards too.” Who doesn’t adore free spending money?', 'Since the 2015 acquisition of Target’s pharmacy business by CVS, the two brands have partnered up for rewards. “CVS Pharmacy users, take note — your ExtraCare card can earn you Target coupons when you fill your prescriptions — up to $50 per year. It’s a hidden perk,” the insider noted.', 'Protect the planet and pad your wallet simultaneously by BYOBing, our eco-conscious insider advised. “Be environmentally conscious and save money.

Despite the US spending more per capita on healthcare than other developed countries, the survey of approximately 2,500 adults, conducted from February to March 2023, highlighted widespread dissatisfaction. More than half of respondents graded the US healthcare system a ""C"" or below, citing factors such as high costs (the most common criticism), profit-driven focus, insurance inaccessibility, and confusion about coverage. Notably, 44% admitted to skipping or delaying needed care in the past two years, with 40% attributing it to costs.', ""Interestingly, amid these challenges, the survey identified some positive sentiments. Over 75% of participants noted that providers collaborate to improve their health, 70% expressed a desire for stronger relationships with their healthcare providers, and more than 65% believed regular engagement with a trusted provider could improve their health. Despite frustrations, these responses suggest a nuanced perspective on the healthcare system's potential improvement.

Shockingly, this rate is the highest among nine developed countries analyzed. Even high-income Americans are almost as likely as lower-income individuals in other nations to defer healthcare due to costs, with 29% admitting to skipping or delaying care. This places the US at a disadvantage, especially considering that other developed countries with universal health coverage exhibit significantly lower rates of delayed or skipped care among high-income populations, ranging from 6% to 16%.', 'As the fall and winter seasons approach, health officials are anticipating a challenging period with a potential increase in viral illnesses, including influenza, COVID-19, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).

Government data released in June 2023, revealed that the number of individuals voluntarily working part-time reached 21.8 million in May, with a 5% increase from the previous year and a 15% rise over the last decade. The tight labor market, with 10.1 million job openings in April, has empowered workers to dictate their working conditions. Moreover, the Freelancers' Union reported a 2.2% increase in freelance professionals in 2022.\xa0"", 'Hence, we see how with the rise of freelancing and remote work opportunities, college students now have increased flexibility to integrate part-time employment seamlessly into their academic lives. The digital era has opened up a plethora of online gigs that allow them to work from anywhere, tapping into a global job market. Two important employers for part time jobs for college students in the US are Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).

The company has invested over $140 million in philanthropic efforts to build skills-based systems, recognizing skills in the same way as formal education. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is taking five key steps to achieve this shift: introducing short-form certificates for in-demand skills, rewriting job descriptions to consider skills over degrees, allowing employees to earn degree credits through on-the-job learning, using technology to connect associates to career opportunities, and funding a skills-based ecosystem through Walmart.org. This strategy aims to retain talented workers and provide opportunities for career growth within the company, potentially giving Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) a competitive edge over rivals like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Target Corp (NYSE:TGT), and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR).', 'The hiring and wages at Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) have become more stable after facing challenges during the pandemic.

The study revealed that the company generated $40 billion in economic impact across the state and contributed to over a quarter of a million jobs during fiscal year 2022.', ""The numbers confirm Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s pivotal role in Florida's economy, with $40.3 billion in total statewide economic impact and 263,000 direct and indirect jobs, equivalent to 1 out of every 32 jobs in the state. The study highlighted the ripple effect of Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s presence, indicating that for every direct job at Disney, an additional 1.7 jobs are supported across Florida.

Morgan About These 2 Energy Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-upgrade-says-j-p-144100012.html,1702046460,STORY,"['OVV', 'DVN']","['No matter how you slice it, our world runs on energy. While the social and political pressures are pushing toward a transition to a green economy, with an emphasis on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, the fact is that we are still dependent on fossil fuels – and will be for the foreseeable future.', 'For investors, that makes energy stocks a solid choice. These companies deal in an essential product, and technological advances in geology, drilling, and pumping permit them to target their operations for the maximum returns.', 'J.P. Morgan’s energy stock expert, Arun Jayaram, has taken a clear-eyed look at the energy sector, noting a switch from an earlier focus on ‘hyper growth’ and well productivity. He writes, “While well productivity still remains important, we think the ability to harness efficiency gains by compressing cycle times is a critical factor for success, particularly given the shift to maintenance capex programs across the industry.”', 'Following this line, Jayaram says it is ‘time to upgrade’ several energy players, and we’ve got the lowdown on two that stand out. We also used TipRanks’ database to find out what the rest of the Street has to say about them. Here’s what we found.', 'TipRanks’ ‘Perfect 10’ Picks: 2 Top-Scoring Stocks for 2024', 'BMO Optimistic About Fintech Stocks in 2024; Here Are 3 Top Picks to Keep an Eye On', 'Mobileye, Goodyear Among Top Picks as Deutsche Bank Assesses Auto Stocks', 'Ovintiv (OVV)', 'The first stock on our list of JPM picks is Ovintiv, an oil and gas exploration and production company in the North American scene. Ovintiv takes a multi-basin approach and has built up a portfolio of world-class production assets based on ‘large, contiguous’ holdings in several major production regions, including the Anadarko and Permian basins of Oklahoma and Texas, and the Montney formation on the Alberta-British Columbia border.', 'The quality of these holdings can be shown by the company’s proven reserves. As of the end of 2022, Ovintiv had proved reserves, both oil and gas, totaling 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Of this total, 50% was in liquids, and 57% was described as ‘proved developed.’ The company’s reserve life index, an approximate measure of how long the proven reserves will last, at the end of 2022, came to 12.2 years.', 'Building on that quality, Ovintiv reported solid production numbers in its last quarterly release from 3Q23. The average total production was 572,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a total that included 214,000 barrels of oil daily, 87,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, and 1.625 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Responding to these numbers, Ovintiv raised its full-year 2023 production guidance to a range of 550,000 to 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.', 'Backing the higher guidance, Ovintiv has also stated that it expects to have all acquired Permian wells in full operation by the end of this year. We should note here that the Permian basin is one of the richest oil and gas production regions in North America and, in the past two decades, has put the state of Texas back on the map as a major global energy supplier.', 'Despite high production and solid reserves to back it up, Ovintiv’s 3Q report missed on earnings. The company’s EPS came to $1.47 by GAAP measures, missing the forecast by 27 cents per share.', 'Ovintiv’s sound prospects are the key point for the JPM view here. Jayaram is upbeat on the company’s potential to increase its Permian basin output, seeing that as the start of the company’s path forward. The 5-star analyst writes, “We upgrade OVV to Overweight from Neutral given the differentiated valuation on FCF as well as potential upside to 2024 expectations on the company’s new frac recipe in the Permian Basin.”', 'Along with the upgraded Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, Jayaram puts a $58 price target on the stock, implying a 39% potential upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Jayaram’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, there are 16 recent reviews on OVV shares from the Street’s analysts, and they break down to 11 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target price here is $57.06, suggesting a 37% gain from the current share price of $41.63. (See Ovintiv stock forecast)', 'Devon Energy (DVN)', 'Next up is Devon Energy, an independent exploration and production company based in Oklahoma City, focused on the exploitation of onshore assets in the continental US. The company’s largest operations are located in Texas-New Mexico-Oklahoma, where it has extensive oil and gas projects in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, and Anadarko Basin formations. Further north, Devon is also working in the Powder River region in Colorado and the Williston Basin of North Dakota.', 'Devon’s extensive operations and holdings make it one of the larger independent US oil and gas producers. At the end of last year, the company was producing 315,000 barrels of oil daily, over 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 150,000 barrels of natural gas liquids. By the end of 3Q23, the most recent set of results that Devon has reported, the company’s total production had increased to 665,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. This marked a 10% year-over-year increase in quarterly production.', 'Devon has managed this while also pursuing a strong commitment to water conservation. The oil and gas industry is known for its high water usage, but Devon has made a priority of using produced, non-potable, or brackish water in its operations, reducing its freshwater consumption rates. Since 2015, Devon has reused more than 250 million barrels of water from water treatment facilities.', 'The company reported revenue and earnings figures for 3Q23 in an early November release. The top line of $3.84 billion was down almost 30% year-over-year, but it beat the forecast by $210 million. The bottom-line figure, the non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, was 10 cents per share better than the estimates.', 'On cash flow, however, Devon somewhat disappointed investors. The company’s operating cash flow was up 23% compared to the second quarter and came in at $1.7 billion. However, the free cash flow of $843 million, while strong compared to Q2, was down 43% year-over-year.', 'JPM’s Jayaram took a deep look in to DVN, and while he acknowledges the issues that the stock is facing, he still upgrades the shares: “In 2023, DVN shares significantly lagged on capital efficiency concerns as the stock underperformed the peer group by ~20% on a YTD and YoY basis. We upgrade DVN shares to Overweight from Neutral given the combination of low expectations and ‘self-help’ initiatives recently messaged by management, which should boost capital efficiency in 2024.”', 'Looking forward, Jayaram lays out several factors that will provide support for DVN, saying, “Importantly, we think the company essentially cleared the decks by providing their 2024 guide on the 3Q23 call, which did feature lower than expected FCF. The key ‘self-help’ initiatives include a shift to higher levels of Delaware Basin activity, a rebound in Delaware Basin productivity as well as high-grading in other basins, and lower YoY capex requirements amid industry cost deflation. This appears to parallel PXD’s high-grading efforts from last year, which drove outperformance.”', 'The end-all, be-all for Jayaram on DVN is that upgrade, a move from Neutral to Overweight (i.e. Buy) on the stock, and a price target of $58 to suggest a 31.5% upside for the year ahead.', 'The Street generally is somewhat bullish on Devon, giving the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 reviews, which include 11 Buys and 9 Holds. The shares are trading for $44.09, and their $56.28 average price target implies ~28% one-year upside potential.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) which saw its share price drive 119% higher over five years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.3%.', ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Micron Technology ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Micron Technology actually saw its EPS drop 30% per year.', ""This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics."", 'We doubt the modest 0.6% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. It is not great to see that revenue has dropped by 2.6% per year over five years. It certainly surprises us that the share price is up, but perhaps a closer examination of the data will yield answers.', 'You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'Micron Technology is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.', 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Micron Technology, it has a TSR of 123% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's nice to see that Micron Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 38% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on Micron Technology it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares."", 'But note: Micron Technology may not be the best stock to buy.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.328. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Doing so could end up being the gift that keeps on giving, in more ways than one.', 'For starters, gifting your grandchildren stocks can be a great way to teach them about personal finance and investing. Knowledge about these topics from an early age could give them a leg up on their peers. It could even help to lay the foundation for financial success/prosperity in adulthood.', 'Second, besides imparting wisdom about building wealth, the stocks you buy for them today could actually create a tidy sum of wealth, decades down the road.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'By purchasing high-quality stocks with strong earnings and dividend growth track records, you could help your grandchildren build a portfolio that could generate strong total returns over a long time frame.', 'So, what are some examples of top stocks to gift your grandchildren? Consider these seven, all of which fit well within the aforementioned criteria.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'A gift of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) could teach your grandchildren the exciting silver lining of investing in high-quality “boring” stocks. This leading payroll processor and managed HR services provider has been a rewarding investment for long-term shareholders.', 'Over the past decade, ADP stock has gained by over 226%, beating the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which has gained by 151.25% during this same time frame. Sure, as the saying goes, past performance is not indicative of future returns. Gains over the coming decade may not meet/exceed the gains of the past decade.', 'Still, as I pointed out last month, earnings forecasts call for the company to report earnings growth of around 9% to 10% over the next few years. Coupled with ADP’s 2.43% dividend (which has grown by double-digits annually on average over the past five years), the potential for market-beating returns remains strong for ADP.', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'If you’re looking for AI stocks to buy for your grandchildren, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) may be a great choice, instead of other popular AI plays such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But why Broadcom?', 'Following their strong performance during 2023, upside from the rise of generative AI and other artificial intelligence applications may already be well baked into the valuations of NVDA and MSFT. Although AVGO stock has gained considerably as well this year (67.26%), shares in this semiconductor and infrastructure software company may have much more future runway from this secular growth trend.', 'Recently closing on its long-awaited acquisition of VMware, Broadcom is now at work realizing billions in potential cost and growth synergies identified at the time of the merger announcement. This, combined with growing AI-related demand for chips and infrastructure software, may result in substantial share price growth for AVGO for many years.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Google and YouTube parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is not only one of the “fun” stocks your grandchildren may like. A blue-chip among tech stocks, the company’s flagship search advertising business gives it a deep competitive moat. Concerns that Google’s market share is dropping due to the rise of ChatGPT may be misplaced.', 'Speaking of AI, much like AVGO, GOOG stock has ample exposure to this trend. As Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently pointed out, Alphabet has made serious progress with its AI endeavors, and 2024 could even be the company’s “Year of AI.”', 'Between continued dominance in search advertising, further growth of its cloud computing unit, plus AI-related catalysts, the company could keep on growing at a moderately-high clip. In turn, leading to further rounds of manyfold gains for GOOG, gains for which your grandchildren will be thankful.', 'Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com', 'Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a defense stock that is also a defensive stock, or a stock that produces steady earnings and pays out consistent dividends, no matter if the economy is booming or experiencing a downturn or recession.', 'Thanks to this resiliency, names like LMT stock can produce steady, satisfactory total returns. Shares have gained by more than threefold over the past decade. Similar to ADP, forecasts strongly suggest that LMT could keep on being a well-oiled compounding machine.', 'Rising global tensions bode well for Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth. This in turn points to LMT continuing to increase its dividend (2.81% forward yield) by a high single-digit figure. Compounded total returns for this stock could result in a moderate gifting of shares today becoming worth a small fortune over time. With this, consider it one of the best stocks to buy for your grandchildren.', 'Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com', 'Some grandparents give their grandkids Mastercard (NYSE:MA) branded gift cards, but shares in this credit card processing giant, or in its main competitor Visa (NYSE:V) may be a far better gift to give.', 'What makes MA stock and V stock some of the best stocks to gift your grandchildren? Both stocks have performed well over the past decade, and above-average returns are very possible, thanks to one key trend. As I recently discussed, both Mastercard and Visa stand to benefit greatly from the switch from cash to digital payments.', 'Assuming this trend continues, leading to further earnings growth in the 15% to 20% range, shares in both companies are likely to continue climbing in tandem with this growth. Compounded over 10 years, 20 years, or perhaps even longer, investing in either or both stocks could enable your grandchildren to accrue a fair bit of wealth.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Chances are your grandchildren aren’t familiar with Roper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP), much less the company’s vast portfolio of subsidiaries that provide businesses with application software, network software, and technology-enabled products.', 'Nevertheless, consider “hiding in plain sight” ROP stock one of the best stocks to buy for your grandchildren. Many investors like Roper Technologies shares because of the stock’s “dividend aristocrat” status. To be a dividend aristocrat, you have to raise your dividend at least 25 years in a row. ROP has more than met this requirement. ROP’s dividend has increased 31 years in a row, with the latest hike representing a 10% increase.', 'However, while ROP’s small-but-growing dividend (0.56% forward yield) provides a small boost for total returns, what appears most appealing about Roper is its potential to keep compounding at an above-average clip, thanks to expected annualized earnings growth of just under 10%.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is yet another well-known stock that, due to long-term growth potential, may make for a great stock gift for your grandchildren. As I’ve pointed out before, UNH has strong potential to continue delivering earnings and dividend growth in the double-digits.', 'Admittedly, some may be skeptical that above-level growth will continue. Given the company’s current size and scope, I’ll concede that generating above-average levels of growth will be difficult. Yet while UNH stock is best known as being a health insurance stock, keep in mind that UnitedHealth Group has diversified into faster-growing segments of healthcare.', 'As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth recently pointed out, a good example of this is UNH’s continued expansion of its presence in the home health and hospice care market. Efforts like this, plus other moves like share repurchases, may go a long way in helping UNH to continue climbing at a double-digit clip.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\xa0InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Several factors are expected to contribute to this growth, including significant increase in the number of flights expected to be available in 2024, at 40.1 million, compared to 36.8 million this year, as well as high demand for travel.', 'Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, made the following comments about the financial outlook for the industry:', '“Considering the major losses of recent years, the $25.7 billion net profit expected in 2024 is a tribute to aviation’s resilience.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most valuable European companies heading into 2024.', 'Europe is considered to be the most advanced region in the world, especially in terms of standard of living, and you will find European nations dominating the list of countries with the highest standard of living in 2023. This is because of the fact that European laws focus more on consumer rights as opposed to corporations, unlike the U.S., where capitalism ensures that corporations can grow unfettered. This is why the most valuable company in the world, Apple, is worth more than 5 times the most valuable European company heading into 2024. This also increases the potential of such stocks being undervalued, and you can learn more by visiting the most undervalued European stocks to buy now.', ""Despite these successes and advancements, Europe was particularly hit hard by the economic slowdown in 2022, and a recession was widely expected in 2023, However, according to the International Monetary Fund, while inflation is expected to remain moderate in Europe, modest growth is expected in the region in 2023 and a growth rate of 1.3% is expected, though it's still much lower than the 2022 growth rate of 2.7%. Higher growth rates are expected from Emerging European Economies which will see their growth climb from 1% in 2023 to 3% in 2024, and are extremely important contributors to European growth as the traditional powerhouses and economic giants will continue to see much lower, stable growth rates."", ""A close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds."", 'Tightening monetary policy to curb inflation has ensured that headline inflation has declined, and tightening policies seem to have peaked in several European countries. On the other hand, energy-intensive countries such as Germany and Hungary are struggling more especially due to the energy crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war. Unfortunately, the war is nowhere close to an end and in fact, many of the most valuable European companies heading into 2024 ended operations in Russia at a great cost, after pressure from investors and most European countries sanctioning Russia, impacting the market cap of the most valuable European countries heading into 2024.', ""We'll focus a bit more on Germany as it is easily the biggest economy in Europe and has been for several years now. German precision has been the benchmark of world class quality for decades, and has led the global market for luxury cars and industrial machinery, so much so that exports were one of the biggest contributors to the country's economy. Lately though, the Germany economy has been struggling in the last couple of years and has very few entries in the most valuable European companies in the world. Right now, Germany is the worst-performing advanced economy in the world and the European Union and IMF both expect its economy to shrink this year. Germany has one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world, and the energy crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war has had a disproportionate impact on the nation's economy."", ""In today's age of tech growth, advancements in this area are intrinsic to economic prosperity, and the most technologically advanced countries in Europe are playing their part in this respect. The value of the tech industry in Europe is already worth over $3 trillion and many of the most valuable European countries heading into 2024 are based in the tech industry. Tech growth in Europe has far surpassed overall economic growth in the region, and European VC returns have equaled U.S. returns both on short-term and long-term horizons, making Europe an attractive destination for investors. This is also why some of the top performing European stocks are tech stocks. A challenge in this respect is that funding has slowed down in 2023 as compared to 2022, falling by 21% to $8.2 billion. Europe's competitiveness in this field has seen its share of global tech funding climb up to 29%, still behind the U.S. but catching up quickly."", 'Because of higher disposable income, top tech companies in the world have established major operations in Europe. At the same time, because of Europe\'s stringent laws, many of the most profitable tech companies in the world are a bit concerned about the future of operations in the region. Meta Platforms, Inc.

This is good news. Though broadly speaking, we continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.""

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Universal Health Services, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.098 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$14b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Universal Health Services has an ROCE of 9.8%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.9%."", ' View our latest analysis for Universal Health Services ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Universal Health Services compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Universal Health Services here  for free."", ""When we looked at the ROCE trend at Universal Health Services, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 9.8% from 13% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Universal Health Services is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 16% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", 'If you want to continue researching Universal Health Services, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.', 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 45% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 9.5% in the last year.', ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' See our latest analysis for PepsiCo ', ""While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Over half a decade, PepsiCo managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""This free interactive report on PepsiCo's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for PepsiCo the TSR over the last 5 years was 67%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Investors in PepsiCo had a tough year, with a total loss of 6.9% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 11% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.
