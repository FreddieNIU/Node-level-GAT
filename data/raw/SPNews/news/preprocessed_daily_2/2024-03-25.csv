However, the Chinese yuan saw gains, buoyed by indications of official backing. The Topix index in Japan was one of the hardest hit, contributing to the overall dip in a regional equity benchmark for the second consecutive session. The decline followed cautionary remarks from Japan's top currency authority, advising against speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index also registered a decrease, while Australian stocks saw modest gains. In Europe and the United States, futures for equity markets showed minimal movement. The strengthening of the Chinese yuan was noteworthy, driven by indications that the authorities were supportive of the currency. This shift in sentiment contributed to the broader market dynamics in Asia. Investors are also closely monitoring inflation data, including the preferred gauge of the Federal Reserve, expected to be released later in the week. These figures will provide insights into the state of inflationary pressures, which could influence central bank policies and market sentiment. The developments in Asian markets underscore the continued influence of geopolitical and economic factors on global financial markets. As uncertainties persist, investors remain vigilant, seeking cues from both domestic and international events to inform their trading strategies and investment decisions. Reuters reports that the U.S. stock market is broadening its rally beyond the dominant tech and growth stocks, thanks to a positive economic outlook and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. Sectors like financials, industrials, and energy are now outperforming, easing concerns about overreliance on a few stocks. The Fed's confidence in controlling inflation and potential rate cuts has further boosted investor sentiment. Despite positive indicators in the labor market, concerns persist about wage gains and inflation, which could impact the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains optimistic about the overall strength of the labor market but acknowledges the need for careful monitoring. However, upcoming inflation data and portfolio adjustments by fund managers may introduce volatility. While tech giants continue to play a significant role in market gains, their dominance has decreased compared to last year. This broader rally signifies a healthier market, less susceptible to corrections. Despite the overall positive trend, some areas like small-cap stocks remain subdued, although they could benefit from the Fed's accommodative stance. Investors are cautiously optimistic, with some expecting the market's diversification to continue, while others anticipate a potential pullback after recent strong gains.

Those streaks (50 for Walmart and 67 for P&G) underscore the unique competitive advantages that these industry leaders enjoy. Walmart is the dominant force in the retailing world, while P&G is the market-share leader in consumer brand categories ranging from paper towels to diapers.', ""Those assets mean that both companies are likely to extend their dividend growth streaks in the coming years. But which one is a better fit for your income portfolio? Let's contrast two of the most popular dividend stocks on the market."", 'Strong sales growth is the foundation of a healthy dividend investment. While both companies are beating peers in this regard, Walmart stands out as having higher-quality demand trends. The retailer posted a 4% sales uptick in the most recent quarter that was mainly driven by rising customer traffic. Shoppers are responding well to its price-leadership selling approach as they look to cut costs. Rival Target, in contrast, has been posting declining customer traffic for more than a year.', 'Procter & Gamble is growing at about the same 4% rate, but those gains are being driven entirely by rising prices. Volume fell 1% last quarter, suggesting consumers are deciding to scale back on purchases of products like Tide detergent and Bounty paper towels in response to higher prices.', 'Walmart is also demonstrating that it can grow in areas outside of its core retailing focus. The company crossed $100 billion of e-commerce sales after that segment expanded 23% last year. Investors are excited about rising digital advertising spending, too. Despite its maturity, Walmart is the better option for growth-focused income investors.', ""P&G does pay a more generous dividend right now, partly thanks to the stock's relatively weak performance over the past year. Shares are yielding 2.3% compared to Walmart's 1.3%. There are fatter yields even in the retailing industry, including Target and its 2.6% payout."", ""As for recent hikes, Walmart just announced a head-turning 9% payout increase for 2024. P&G won't reveal its annual raise until mid-April, but investors can expect something similar to last year's 3% boost."", ""It's too early to tell whether Walmart's dividend will keep growing at a faster pace from here, and that's why income investors might prefer Procter & Gamble for its higher yield and its stronger profit margin (23% compared to Walmart's 4%)."", ""P&G is easily the more expensive stock, but for some good reasons. These include its strong profit margin that sits north of 20% of sales, along with its ample cash flow. These factors allowed it to return $16 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends last year. Walmart's capital returns were closer to $9 billion."", ""It's worth keeping Walmart on your watch list, though, to look for signs that the company is making a meaningful move toward higher profit margins as it pushes deeper into tech growth niches like digital advertising.

It's far from being a growth name. And priced at 26 times this fiscal year's expected earnings, the stock's not exactly a bargain. There are still lots of good reasons to own shares of Walmart anyway. Three of them stand out among the rest."", ""The biggest company in any given business isn't inherently the best to invest in. But it would be naïve to pretend a particular company becomes a market leader by sheer dumb luck. In nearly all cases the biggest name in the business got that way by doing something better than the rest."", ""With that as the backdrop, there's a reason Walmart has been able to become the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer. It's been doing things differently since Sam Walton started the company with a single store back in 1962 -- that is, offering shoppers a wide array of products at the lowest-possible price."", ""Since then, the company has built or bought over 10,000 more stores here and abroad, all of them focused on remaining the low-price leader. That's how Walmart now sells about one-fourth of this nation's groceries, and accounts for a healthy 17% of total retail consumption in the U.S., according to numbers from Capital One."", ""For perspective, next-nearest competitor Target only operates around 2,000 locations, and reports U.S. sales of less than half of Walmart's. There are also only about 2,750 Kroger-owned grocery stores. Not only does Walmart's dominance underscore that it is doing something right, but it often also discourages rivals from building competing stores in the same area."", ""With nothing more than a passing glance Walmart looks like the same company it was five years ago, 10 years ago, and even 30 years ago. That's a problem simply because consumers are changing, and retailing is changing with it. Take a closer look, though. Walmart is new and improved in many ways, and not just because it's finally taking e-commerce more seriously."", ""Consider its foray into advertising as an example. Walmart.com isn't just a place for the company to sell goods (or third-party merchants' goods) online. It's also an advertising platform in and of itself. Walmart generated $3.4 billion worth of advertising revenue last year, with brands paying the retailer to help promote their particular products at Walmart's e-commerce site."", ""That's outstanding for the relatively young venture. This is also high-margin revenue captured in a way that doesn't dilute or cannibalize Walmart's existing retail efforts."", ""Meanwhile, the 2020 launch of Walmart+ was a direct jab at Amazon Prime, by offering its members a subscription-based means of free at-home delivery of online orders. While it can't be said that Walmart+ has been a smashing success, it's a sign that at least the company is willing to try new and unusual things. Some of them work."", ""Last but not least, Walmart's overwhelming size gives it a big advantage over competitors -- not only discouraging grocers like Kroger and discounters like Target from setting up stores nearby, but in other ways too."", ""Thanks to its broad footprint, Walmart is able to push back on brands when needed. That's exactly what it did a little over a year ago -- telling vendors to curb their own production costs or risk losing placement of their increasingly expensive goods on Walmart stores' shelves. Suppliers mostly responded."", ""Walmart's huge size also gives it deeper pockets, allowing the retailer to make meaningful acquisitions that others just can't. Case in point: Last month Walmart revealed plans to acquire consumer electronics brand Vizio for a cool $2.3 billion.

', 'The stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were expecting at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. Back then, the Federal Reserve had yet to start to raise interest rates, even though some voices on Wall Street were raising alarm bells about the effects of the monetary policy and stimulus packages in the era of COVID-19 lock downs. High rates naturally do not bode well for high growth sectors, and technology stocks big and small had a rough time on the market the next year particularly as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global food and energy markets and spurred multi year high inflation levels which made some question whether consecutive 75 basis point hikes by the Federal Reserve were still a bit low.', 'Now, with the first quarter of 2024 coming to an end, the stock market is a fundamentally changed environment due to the rise of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA has shown to be the hottest artificial intelligence stock on Wall Street, and at its heart is the multi-billion global data center industry. While most people experience the user side of AI, at its heart, the technology is part of a broader set of data analysis techniques such as machine learning.', ""Whether it's AI or ML, both require copious amounts of data to spearhead leading edge applications in high technology industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Processing and storing this data requires considerable data center facilities, which are large scale computing houses that 'host' equipment such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage modules."", 'A variety of firms cater to the needs of the global data center industry. Some of the best known in this area are data center hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). On the software side, firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide businesses with software environments to generate meaningful insights from their data.', ""Therefore, to analyze the performance of data center stocks, one can either see how individual firms such as the equities listed above are performing or track a collection of stocks called an exchange traded fund (ETF). Most popular data center ETFs also include real estate investment trusts (ETFs) due to the sizeable real estate requirements of operating and owning data centers. One such ETF is the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Its six month, 12 month, and 36 month year returns sit at 14.5%, 22.27%, and 2.10%, respectively. As expected, the ETF's annual returns in 2022 were negative, as the broader technology sector took a beating."", ""Finally, one stock that helps keep track of the broader data center industry might be faring is Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

They include the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, increased cloud computing adoption, the ongoing growth in mobile data and internet traffic, and artificial intelligence as a new wave of data center demand.', 'In the last few months, we have also spent time with CEO Andy Power of Digital Realty. Over the last few years, Andy and Digital Realty’s management team have been undergoing a business transformation, which accelerated after its acquisition of Interxion in March 2020, a pure-play European network-dense data center operator. The company has been shedding non-core slower-growth assets, investing and expanding in Europe, growing its retail colocation business, improving its balance sheet, and adding operational expertise by supplementing new management leadership. We have spent a significant amount of time with Andy over the years and believe the investments the company has made are on the cusp of bearing fruit and will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, we believe the fundamentals in its core business are at an inflection point with robust demand/bookings, pricing power, hyperscale cloud players outsourcing a higher percentage of their digital infrastructure needs and limited competitive capacity.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.', 'On March 20, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, spoke at a press conference where he highlighted the Fed\'s interest rate policy moving forward. He noted that the Fed would remain committed to its ""dual mandate"" to promote ""maximum employment and stable prices"" to the population of the United States. While Powell spoke about the resilience of the US economy so far in 2024, he also commented on the fact that inflation being reduced is not an assured development for the year as of yet. The Fed\'s March decision also highlighted that the Fed would maintain its federal funds rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Additionally, Powell stated that the Fed will also continue to remain committed to bringing US inflation down to the Fed\'s 2% target.', ""While the Fed meeting this March did not pinpoint any month for potential rate cuts this year, many financial professionals expect the first rate cut of 2024 to come in June. Additionally, the Fed is currently anticipating a total of three rate cuts this year, though this may be subject to change depending on external factors influencing the state of the US economy. Chairman Powell noted in the March press conference that high interest rates also impacted business investment in the US throughout 2023. Considering this, keeping updated on the Fed's latest moves in the rate cut department can be vital for investors in the US today."", ""After the Fed's announcements, US equities and the S&P 500 rallied to record levels. During times of economic uncertainty, investors may be considering where to put their money to ensure higher returns and profitability for themselves and their portfolios. We believe that a good place to start would be the type of stocks that are well-rounded and renowned in the market, particularly stocks with higher market capitalizations, that is, large-cap stocks. This assumption comes from the fact that these stocks have much to offer to investors, both in terms of market capitalization, which typically ranges from $10 billion to $200 billion in the large-cap bracket and in terms of revenue growth."", ""By way of example, let's look at the earnings brought in by some of the stocks on our list below.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) brought in an EPS of $0.54, beating estimates by $0.09, while its $15.4 billion revenue beat estimates by $231.1 million. Finally, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had an EPS of $3.11 for the fourth quarter, beating estimates by $0.33. The company's revenue came in at $2.4 billion and beat estimates by $35.3 million. These are merely three examples of the value and potential of large-cap stocks, and yet an even more exciting prospect for investors in today's market may be the rise of some of the most undervalued stocks in this group since these stocks would offer investors the chance to buy into attractive stock opportunities offering more value than many other stocks in the market.

That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$308). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Salesforce insiders own 2.7% of the company, worth about US$8.2b.

""Nvidia doesn\'t build chips. Nvidia builds data centers,"" Huang said. He continued: ""Nvidia\'s opportunity is not the GPU opportunity. A lot of people make GPUs. We\'re pursuing the data center market.""', 'That strategy not only creates monetization possibilities beyond GPUs, but also reduces friction for customers. As Huang explained, Nvidia essentially sells ready-made data centers purpose-built for powering AI workloads.', 'With that in mind, Nvidia values its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share by 35% annually over the next five years. While impressive, that consensus estimate still makes its current valuation of 77 times earnings look quite expensive.', 'Personally, I would wait for a much cheaper entry point before purchasing Nvidia stock, and I say that as a current shareholder.', 'This tech giant posted strong financial results for the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 18% to $62 billion on solid sales growth in commercial software and cloud computing services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped 26% to $2.93 per diluted share due to disciplined expense management. Management guided for 14% to 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, and investors can expect similar results in the future as the company leans into AI.', 'Microsoft dominates the software-as-a-service market due in large part to success with its office productivity (Microsoft 365), enterprise resource management (Dynamics 365), and cybersecurity products. The company has introduced generative AI copilots that automate tasks across those software categories. For instance, Microsoft 365 Copilot can draft text in Word, create presentations in PowerPoint, and analyze data in Excel. Management expects those generative AI copilots to contribute more significantly to revenue in the future.', 'Meanwhile, Microsoft is also gaining market share in cloud computing. Its Azure unit accounted for 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the fourth quarter, up nearly 2 percentage points from the prior year. CEO Satya Nadella attributes those share gains to investments in AI, most notably its partnership with OpenAI. Specifically, Microsoft is the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI, and Azure customers can build custom generative AI applications using OpenAI large language models like GPT-4, the cognitive engine behind ChatGPT Plus.', 'Going forward, the software-as-a-service market is forecast to grow by 13.7% annually, and the cloud computing market is projected to expand at a 14.1% annualized rate during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at generating annual revenue growth in the low teens through the end of the decade. Investors can expect slightly faster growth on the bottom line due share buybacks and continued focus on cost control.', 'Indeed, Wall Street expects Microsoft to boost its earnings per share by 16% annually over the next five years. But that consensus forecast makes the current valuation of nearly 39 times earnings look quite expensive. Microsoft is an excellent company with strong growth prospects, but I would be surprised to see this Magnificent Seven stock beat the market over the next five years from its current price.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

LW continues to reap benefits from an effective pricing scenario. The provider of value-added frozen potato products is focused on expanding its capacity to drive growth. However, the company is not immune to the rising cost environment.Let’s delve deeper.', 'Lamb Weston’s net sales are benefiting from robust price/mix, as witnessed during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The price/mix rose 12%, which reflects gains from inflation-induced pricing actions in business units and a positive mix. In the North America segment, price/mix increased 14% on the carryover benefit of pricing actions undertaken during fiscal 2023 and positive mix, stemming from continued gains from revenue growth management and other mix improvement efforts. In the International segment, price/mix advanced 10%.Moreover, strategic pricing actions drove Lamb Weston’s quarterly net sales, which increased 36% year over year. Net sales, excluding buyouts, are projected to increase 6.5-8.5% in the fiscal 2024, on a low double-digit percentage points increase in price/mix.Lamb Weston’s sturdy balance sheet and capacity to generate cash keep it well-placed to boost production capacity and fuel long-term growth. The company’s efforts to boost offerings and expand capacity enable it to meet the rising demand conditions for snacks and fries effectively.Capital expenditures amounted to $566.5 million during the first half of fiscal 2024, owing to construction and equipment purchases as LW continues to expand its processing capacity in Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that its new greenfield processing facility in China is now operational. For the fiscal 2024, the company expects cash to be used for capital expenditures in the band of $900-$950 million.', 'Lamb Weston has been witnessing increased SG&A expenses for a while. In second-quarter fiscal 2024, SG&A expenses escalated by $60.2 million to $170 million. The downside can be attributed to expenses associated with bettering information systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) infrastructure as well as higher compensation, among others.In addition, cost inflation for key inputs like raw potatoes, grains, starches and labor are putting pressure on margins to some extent. Management expects fiscal third-quarter gross margin to be under pressure by escalated manufacturing costs, reflecting lower fixed cost coverage and other cost inefficiencies. That being said, the company’s focus on the upsides mentioned above is likely to keep aiding growth.', 'Players like Sysco Corporation SYY, Flowers Foods, Inc. FLO and Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG have also been grappling with inflationary headwinds.Sysco has been encountering product cost inflation for a while. In second-quarter fiscal 2024, SYY witnessed product cost inflation of 1.1%, measured by the estimated change in product costs, mainly in the meat and frozen categories. During the quarter, Sysco’s operating expenses rose 3.9% due to cost inflation and increased volumes. The persistence of these trends is a concern.Flowers Foods is also battling hurdles due to cost inflation. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, FLO’s materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) were partly impacted by elevated labor and maintenance costs. The inflationary environment may continue to pose challenges for Flowers Foods, potentially impacting consumer purchasing power and input costs, which could affect profitability.Conagra has been encountering cost inflation, though the trend has been moderating of late. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, CAG’s adjusted gross margin contracted 129 basis points to 26.9%, hurt by the inflated cost of goods sold to the tune of 1.7%, lower organic sales and unfavorable operating leverage. Conagra expects the net cost of goods sold inflation of nearly 3% in fiscal 2024.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the detailed analysis of the farmland and agriculture industry, go directly to the 5 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Buy.', 'Similar to most industries in the market, the agriculture industry has also faced some volatility over the last few years. Even though the industry is indispensable due to the rising global population and growing demand for food, the agriculture business is susceptible to market weaknesses. The COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the recent Red Sea attacks, all of them have affected the industry in some capacity.', 'The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that between March and April 2020, food service and drinking place sales declined by $47.5 billion compared to the same period a year before. Nevertheless, the US farmers showed resilience, and it can be seen in stock prices between March and April 2020. Between March 22, 2019, and March 20, 2020, iShares MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI) and VanEck Agribusiness ETF (MOO) declined by 30.69% and 27.07%, respectively. This loss in share prices wasn’t limited to agriculture stocks but also the broader market due to the 2020 stock market crash that began on February 20 and ended on April 7, 2020. In the next 12 months, iShares MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI) and VanEck Agribusiness ETF (MOO) gained 110% and approximately 97%, respectively.', 'Compared to the pandemic, the Russian invasion had more adverse effects on the agriculture market, as Ukraine and Russia are some of the biggest grain exporters in the world. The agriculture stocks climbed significantly shortly after the attack due to rising commodity prices, but this was short-lived, and these ETFs have not recovered after their April 2022 highs. MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI) is still down nearly 24% from its April 14, 2022 levels, and VanEck Agribusiness ETF (MOO) is over 31% lower at the time of writing on March 22.\xa0', 'In an interview for CNBC on May 16, 2022, Sal Gilbertie, president and CEO of Teucrium Trading LLC, said that after the pandemic and the war, the demand for commodities rose due to anticipated supply chain disruptions and not because of their need, which according to him are the biggest ripple effects of the two major events.', 'To put things in perspective, before the war, Ukraine exported 6 million tons of corn and wheat combined per month. The exports reached their highest levels post-war in December 2023, which were 5.18 million tons, as reported by gro-intelligence. This shows that the Ukrainian grain imports are recovering but have not reached the pre-war levels.', 'In addition to all of that, the widespread presence of mine contamination due to the war is also a significant threat to the farmers in Ukraine. According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy, 6.5 million acres of the country’s farmland are affected by landmines and other explosives.\xa0', 'Since October 2023, the Iran-backed rebel group, the Houthis, has disrupted the Red Sea shipping route in response to the Middle-East conflict. The Red Sea is a prominent shipping route between Europe, Asia, and Australia and is one of the most used seaborne trade routes in the world. The latest sinking of the MV Rubymar vessel by the rebels (as mentioned in our article 11 Oversold Energy Stocks You Can Buy Right Now), which was carrying fertilizers, shows that these attacks not only threaten the environment but also the costs of goods such as crops, fertilizers, and even oil. These attacks have forced several vessels to take the longer route around Africa.', 'Despite so many disruptions, farmers around the globe are some of the most resilient people. Events that lead to such disruptions mostly lead to innovations, which we can see in the latest agriculture tech trends.', 'Some of the best companies in the farmland and agriculture industry, such as Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), have been making moves in smart agriculture. In our article, 30 Most Profitable Agricultural Business Ideas for Young Entrepreneurs, we discussed Corteva, Inc.’s (NYSE:CTVA) LumiGEN seed treatment portfolio, which includes LumiTreo, the new three-way premix fungicide treatment. The seed treatment category leader at Corteva Agriscience, Brad Van Kooten, said:', '“LumiTreo fungicide seed treatment will bring a welcome and significant boost to yield potential as the ingredients will provide significant protection against Phytophthora sojae, known as the number one soybean disease for causing substantial yield reduction in North America.”', 'Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) is also one of the leading companies in the genetically modified crops market, as discussed in our article, 15 Countries that Produce the Most Genetically Modified Crops.', 'Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is another prominent name in the industry. In a CNBC interview, senior vice president & chief technology officer of the company, Jahmy Hindman, mentioned the company’s See & Spray technology. The technology helps farmers detect weeds in their fields and apply herbicides directly onto them instead of spraying the whole field like farmers used to do before. Furthermore, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is also planning to create fully autonomous farms by 2030. Hindman said:', '“As AI continues to evolve, we’ll create smarter, more efficient, and more automated machines. They will help farmers care for every plant in every square foot of their field. It will make every job on the farm more productive and profitable. AI will also help us reach our goal of creating a fully autonomous production cycle for corn and soybean farmers by 2030. This means crops can be planted, sprayed, and harvested with autonomous technology. To reach this goal, we’ll continue deploying AI — along with robotics, sensors, data, and connectivity — to meet our customers’ most pressing needs.”', 'In our article, 11 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Buy posted in October 2023, we mentioned that the world is moving toward sustainable practices and it is leading to the growth of the organic farming industry. In 2010, the US organic food products sales were around $26.9 billion (inflation-adjusted to 2021 dollars) and reached $52.0 billion in 2021. Furthermore, USDA reported that between 2010 and 2021, certified organic cropland acres saw a 79% rise, reaching 3.6 million acres, while pastureland/rangeland experienced a 22% decrease. Moreover, the number of certified operations increased by over 90%, reaching 17,445 farms.', 'According to a market report by the Business Research Company, the global organic food market value is expected to increase from $215.350 billion in 2022 to $412.928 billion in 2027 and grow further to $894.554 billion by 2032. Between 2023 and 2027, the organic food market is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9%, and between 2028 and 2032, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16.7%.', 'Keeping all of the above data in mind, some of the best farmland and agriculture stocks include Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), Corteva, Inc.

CNH Industrial’s share price fell following its second-quarter results, as agriculture equipment sales rose 5% in local currency, a slowdown from the prior quarter. This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer. We believe the production issues are temporary while the destocking actions will better position the business for the midterm. Pricing power remains quite strong and increased by roughly 7%, and precision agricultural sales grew by 21%. While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%—an encouraging development that supports our view of the company’s long-term profitability. Further, the much smaller construction business delivered strong results, including its own quarterly margin record. Management maintained guidance for the rest of the company’s current fiscal year and indicated it expects to exceed the 2024 targets laid out at a capital markets day in 2022. We recently met with CEO Scott Wine at the company’s offices. He expressed confidence in the company’s ability to drive much better through-cycle financial performance while avoiding the company’s previous mistakes. He also believes the company’s share price is materially undervalued, and although he would prefer to invest in the business, he sees an opportunity to increase returns to shareholders via share repurchases.

Two stocks in particular – Hain Celestial (HAIN) and The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG) – while big winners for us in 2020 and 2021, hurt the portfolio in 2022.', 'While both companies were so-called COVID beneficiaries (businesses that benefited from consumers staying home and spending on their homes during COVID), we felt they possessed certain additional drivers that would maintain their fundamentals into 2022 and beyond.', 'Scott’s Miracle-Gro is arguably one of the great American franchises. The brand is synonymous with lawn care and pest control, has a dominant market share (~60%) with historically-impressive ~30% cash flow margins, and has the country’s largest Cannabis supply business. Scotts’ core business saw a significant windfall during COVID lockdowns. Lawn and garden care is not a growth business, and SMG dominance does not allow for much incremental gain in market share. However, our thesis was that even in a reopening scenario where lawn and garden businesses would revert to the mean, the cannabis market was poised for years of growth as more states legalized recreational use.', 'What we missed was the highly inefficient structure of the U.S. cannabis market. Currently, California, Colorado, and Michigan have the biggest and most mature markets. However, over the course of the last few years, several very large states and regions have voted to legalize recreational use, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The fly in the ointment has been Oklahoma, which is a medical marijuana state. Although recreational use is still prohibited, licenses to grow the crop were granted in Laissez Faire fashion to anyone willing to buy one. Oklahoma began to grow and cultivate the crop far in excess of their medical marijuana demand. That excess supply bled into grey markets across the country, devastating pricing for growers in other states. This glut put a near complete stop to capital spending on grow operations. With no new or incremental facilities coming on, Scotts’ Hawthorne business was cut in half from its peak in F21. This, of course, had a devastating effect on the stock.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31', 'FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) is a Pennsylvania-based company that provides products for plant health, crop protection, and professional pest and turf management.

Following robust orders during the 2020-2022 period, customer destocking persisted throughout 2023, particularly in Latin America. Despite strong end-market demand, market forces, including inflationary prices and sharply higher interest rates, have combined to motivate customers to draw down existing inventories. As a result, FMC lowered its 2023 guidance and introduced a global restructuring initiative. In November, we attended FMC’s Investor Day where management detailed its strategic plans and introduced mid-term financial goals.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

While Powell spoke about the resilience of the US economy so far in 2024, he also commented on the fact that inflation being reduced is not an assured development for the year as of yet.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024.\xa0', ""The real estate investment trust (REIT) in the US is an important component of the real estate market and the broader financial landscape. The sector has experienced substantial growth over the years. As per Ernst & Young's findings, publicly traded REITs have witnessed a remarkable compound annual growth rate of around 16.8% from the close of 1990. During this period, their collective equity market capitalization surged from $9 billion to nearly $1.27 trillion by the end of 2022. In addition to this, REITs in the US oversee a total of $4.5 trillion worth of real estate assets globally as of September 2023, according to CNBC."", ""The contribution of the REIT sector to the US economy stands unmatched. Through its diverse activities including operations, dividend income, interest payments, and construction projects, the sector has played a significant role in fostering economic growth. In particular, these activities have contributed a substantial $262.9 billion in labor income to the economy in 2022. Following a lackluster performance in 2022, the past year showed some improvement for the REIT sector, with positive returns recorded. The index tracks the performance of publicly traded REITs headquartered in the US. While the sector didn't outperform the broader market, the S&P United States REIT Index managed to achieve a total return of 13.77% over the year. That said, the REIT stocks experienced a significant surge, surpassing the performance of the overall market during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index concluded the quarter with an impressive total return of 17.9%, whereas the S&P 500 recorded a return of 11.7% for the same period."", ""In addition to delivering strong returns, the REIT sector also experienced notable growth in capital market activity last year, marking a significant uptick from 2022. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the industry successfully raised a total of $58.27 billion, reflecting a robust increase of 13.5% compared to the $51.36 billion raised in 2022. This surge in capital raising underscores the sector's resilience and attractiveness to investors amidst evolving market conditions. The report also mentioned that the majority of the capital raised by REITs stemmed from debt offerings, totaling $44.87 billion."", ""REIT stocks are gaining popularity among Americans, largely due to the sector's positive performance. A report by Nareit indicated that by the end of 2023, approximately 168 million Americans, representing about 50% of US households, had invested in REIT stocks. REIT investors have historically expressed concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on the sector's performance. This is primarily because higher interest rates tend to lower property values and increase borrowing costs for REITs. Additionally, as interest rates rise, the relatively high dividend yields offered by REITs become less appealing compared to lower-risk fixed-income securities, reducing their attractiveness to income-oriented investors. However, historical data suggests that the performance of REIT stocks during periods of high-interest rates may not be as dire as commonly feared. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, since the early 1970s, there have been six significant periods of rising 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields. In four of these periods, US REITs delivered positive total returns, with half of them even outperforming the S&P 500 index. In one instance, both US REITs and the S&P 500 exhibited nearly identical performances, while in only two instances the S&P 500 outperformed US REITs."", 'Considering their past performance, analysts have presented a positive outlook for the REIT sector in 2024. As mentioned above, the capital market activity within the sector has significantly grown last year, which would positively impact the sector’s productivity this year. Furthermore, Nareit noted that the REIT sector has shown superior performance compared to both private real estate and equities during periods following interest rate hikes. Given that the Federal Reserve is either at or nearing the conclusion of its interest rate hike cycle, this is promising for the outlook of REIT performance in 2024.

CNH Industrial’s share price fell following its second-quarter results, as agriculture equipment sales rose 5% in local currency, a slowdown from the prior quarter. This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer. We believe the production issues are temporary while the destocking actions will better position the business for the midterm. Pricing power remains quite strong and increased by roughly 7%, and precision agricultural sales grew by 21%. While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%—an encouraging development that supports our view of the company’s long-term profitability. Further, the much smaller construction business delivered strong results, including its own quarterly margin record. Management maintained guidance for the rest of the company’s current fiscal year and indicated it expects to exceed the 2024 targets laid out at a capital markets day in 2022. We recently met with CEO Scott Wine at the company’s offices. He expressed confidence in the company’s ability to drive much better through-cycle financial performance while avoiding the company’s previous mistakes. He also believes the company’s share price is materially undervalued, and although he would prefer to invest in the business, he sees an opportunity to increase returns to shareholders via share repurchases.

However, our thesis was that even in a reopening scenario where lawn and garden businesses would revert to the mean, the cannabis market was poised for years of growth as more states legalized recreational use.', 'What we missed was the highly inefficient structure of the U.S. cannabis market. Currently, California, Colorado, and Michigan have the biggest and most mature markets. However, over the course of the last few years, several very large states and regions have voted to legalize recreational use, including New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The fly in the ointment has been Oklahoma, which is a medical marijuana state. Although recreational use is still prohibited, licenses to grow the crop were granted in Laissez Faire fashion to anyone willing to buy one. Oklahoma began to grow and cultivate the crop far in excess of their medical marijuana demand. That excess supply bled into grey markets across the country, devastating pricing for growers in other states. This glut put a near complete stop to capital spending on grow operations. With no new or incremental facilities coming on, Scotts’ Hawthorne business was cut in half from its peak in F21.

We have also talked about the companies that offer paid vacation days in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries With Most Paid Vacation Days Per Year.\xa0', ""While US is largely known as one of the countries with the least vacation days, the Pew Research Center's recent study reveals that a large portion of US workers don't fully utilize their paid time off benefits. More than 4 in 10 employees, approximately 46%, take less time off than offered by their employers, according to the survey. Notably, upper-income workers exhibit a higher tendency of 51% to underutilize this benefit compared to middle- and lower-income counterparts.\xa0"", ""Disparities are also evident across educational attainment levels, with 51% of workers with a bachelor's degree or higher opting not to take all their available time off, contrasting with 41% of those with less education. Factors such as employment type and industry further influence this trend. Salaried employees (52%) and managers (54%) are more inclined to forego their allotted time off compared to hourly workers and non-managers. Moreover, workers in education (68%) and government/public administration/military sectors (57%) demonstrate higher rates of underutilization than those in other industries. While reasons for not taking all available time off vary, most common reasons are not feeling the need to, concerns about falling behind at work, and guilt about placing additional burdens on coworkers.\xa0"", 'Similarly, less than two in 10 employees in Japan take annual paid leave, with Gen X employees being the most reluctant to do so, with 84% of them not utilizing their owed leave. This reluctance stems from deep-rooted cultural attitudes towards work ethic and a fear of inconveniencing others, as taking leave is often viewed as causing meiwaku, or inconvenience, to colleagues and clients. The pressure to prioritize work over personal time is further exacerbated by the belief that overtime or time spent at work, rather than on holiday, increases the chance of promotion, perpetuating a cycle of overwork.', 'Despite government reforms introduced in 2019 in Japan to address issues such as excessive overtime and unused leave, the cultural norms surrounding work persist. While initiatives like caps on working hours and premium pay for overtime have been implemented, there remains a major challenge in changing attitudes towards taking time off.\xa0', ""In the context of the US, where paid holiday isn't mandated by law, travel perks hold particular appeal. With rising living costs globally, offering paid holiday expenses becomes a significant value-add for employees. Moreover, the attraction of these perks isn't merely about extravagant vacations; it's a strategic way to attract and retain talent in a competitive job market.\xa0"", 'In a post-pandemic era where work-life balance is paramount, companies are redefining perks by offering generous travel incentives. Travel-related companies spearheaded this trend, with Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) granting employees $2,000 in annual travel credits, while Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) reimburses travel expenses between $1,250 to $1,750. Now, different industries are following suit, with companies like Calendly providing a $1,000 vacation stipend and Bamboo HR offering a $2,000 annual travel allowance.', 'Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) has established itself as a pioneer in supporting its workforce with strong paid leave policies. Recognized by the National Partnership for Women and Families in 2021, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s innovative approach to bereavement leave, offering paid time off for employees mourning the loss of a close family member, highlights its commitment to employee well-being. With a range of paid leave options available, including parental leave of up to 10 weeks, medical leave for birth parents of up to 12 weeks, and caregiver leave offering up to 6 weeks of paid time off, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) ensures that employees can prioritize their familial responsibilities without financial strain.', 'Through initiatives like phased return to work, providing a 12-week transition period for new parents to work at 80% capacity while receiving full pay, Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) empowers employees to balance their professional and personal lives effectively. These policies not only enhance employee morale and satisfaction but also contribute to improved productivity and retention rates within the company.', 'However, despite Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s proactive stance on paid leave, the absence of a national policy in the US highlights broader challenges facing workers nationwide.\xa0', 'On the other hand, apart from paid leave, staff members at Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) also enjoy exclusive discounts on the platform and receive travel bonuses for successful referrals. Moreover, many employees at Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE)\xa0 qualify for an IATAN card, granting them professional travel credentials that unlock a plethora of perks including special incentives from airlines, hotels, cruise lines, car rental services, and tourist attractions.', 'Kamira/Shutterstock.com', 'To list the countries with the most paid vacation days per year, we 50 identified countries with the most public holidays in the world.

Elements such as varying interest rates and persistent concerns regarding inflation consistently drive investors to reserve a portion of their funds. In this regard, dividend stocks emerge as an optimal choice, providing shareholders with consistent income distributions on a quarterly or monthly basis. Moreover, according to Hartford Funds, dividends have yielded robust returns for shareholders over the last 92 years, surpassing the performance of the overall market. The report highlighted that between 1940 and 2023, dividend income accounted for an average of 34% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index.', 'Investors consistently harbor concerns regarding how inflation might affect their investment choices. Fortunately, dividend stocks have shown resilience against inflationary pressures over the years, often surpassing inflationary trends instead of being significantly impacted by them. Historical analysis indicates that dividend stocks have proven to be among the top-performing investment options during inflationary periods. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, dividends exhibited an average annual growth rate of 5.7% from 1957 to 2022, surpassing the 3.68% average growth rate of inflation over the same period. Similarly, for the period between 1990 and 2022, dividends demonstrated an average growth rate of 5.6%, significantly outpacing the 2.64% growth rate of inflation during this time span.', 'Engaging in dividend stock investment requires a meticulous strategy for managing returns. Investors typically undertake a thorough analysis that includes comparing dividend levels with stock prices to make informed decisions. By carrying out these comparisons, investors can assess the relative attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks based on their yield and potential for capital appreciation. Several reports have also conducted comparisons between the performance of dividend stocks and that of stock prices and showed the superior performance of dividend equities. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, there have been merely six instances where dividend levels experienced a decline, and only one of those occasions saw a decrease exceeding 5%. In stark contrast, throughout the same period, stock prices encountered declines in 18 years, with the most severe annual decline exceeding 40% and an average decline surpassing 11%. This means that stock prices exhibited more than twice the volatility compared to the underlying dividend cash flows during this period.', 'When considering investments in dividend stocks, low-priced equities have their own appeal. One of the main reasons for this is that dividend stocks with low prices may have greater potential for capital appreciation, as they have more room to grow compared to higher-priced stocks. In addition to this, if the company behind the low-priced dividend stock increases its dividends over time, investors could benefit from both increased income and potential capital gains. However, conducting thorough research on the company’s financial health and balance sheet is crucial when making such investment decisions.

Specific to Stryker, the concern was that weight loss would reduce demand for hip and knee implant procedures because obesity is one factor that drives osteoarthritis. We think this concern was overstated and saw the sell-off as an opportunity to buy a high-quality growth company at a reasonable valuation. We think Stryker is well positioned with its broad product portfolio to benefit from the trend of more orthopedic and other medical procedures moving from the hospital to ambulatory surgery centers. The company also has several new product launches coming up that should drive growth. At its recent Investor Day, management provided long-term financial goals including organic sales growth at the high end of the medical technology industry and double-digit EPS growth.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56', 'Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a renowned global medical technology company specializing in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of device-based medical therapies worldwide.

Because of this long-term mindset and commitment to product innovation, the company is in a position today where it has numerous significant new product launches across the business, helping to accelerate growth and improve profitability. More recently, the market’s infatuation with the promise of GLP-1 drugs has resulted in valuation de-ratings across the medtech industry broadly, to which Medtronic was not immune.

The Board encourages shareholders to read its preliminary proxy materials for additional information, which can be found on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.', 'Additionally, the Company issued the following letter to Crown Castle Shareholders, which lays out the steps that the Board is currently taking to create shareholder value and aims to set the record straight regarding certain statements made by Ted Miller and Boots Capital Management, LLC (“Boots Capital”).', 'Dear Shareholders,', 'The Crown Castle Board and management team believe that we have made significant strides over the last three months toward creating a stronger and more valuable company. We remain focused on the comprehensive strategic and operating review of the fiber and small cell business, in conjunction with Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Paul, Weiss and leading industry consultants.

Included below are responses to certain of Ted Miller’s claims.', 'Ted Miller Claim1', 'Setting the Record Straight', 'Claim: Crown Castle’s Board “continues to refuse to meaningfully engage with us or our value enhancing proposal”', 'Crown Castle has engaged extensively with Ted Miller since the outset of his campaign.', 'On December 27, 2023, Rob Bartolo and Interim CEO Tony Melone had a meeting with Mr. Miller in which Mr. Miller presented Boots Capital’s proposals for the Company.', 'On January 30, 2024, members of the Board and Crown Castle advisors met for nearly two hours with representatives of Boots Capital, namely Messrs.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Merck ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2023 Merck had US$35.1b of debt, an increase on US$30.7b, over one year. However, it also had US$7.09b in cash, and so its net debt is US$28.0b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Merck had liabilities of US$25.7b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$43.3b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$7.09b as well as receivables valued at US$11.7b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$50.2b.', 'Since publicly traded Merck shares are worth a very impressive total of US$313.7b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Merck's debt is 3.4 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 5.8 times over. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Importantly, Merck's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 78% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Merck's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Merck generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 86% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Merck's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Merck's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   5 warning signs  we've spotted with Merck ."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

According to a Factor Performance Analysis report published by Confluence Technologies this January, this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets, as opposed to value and yield. As a result, growth and volatility significantly outperformed value and yield in both the fourth quarter and generally in 2023 as well.', 'Today, stocks in the semiconductors, cloud computing, and biotechnology sectors are making up a significant chunk of growth stocks. These sectors are some of the best performers in the market so far this year, making them attractive investments for a long time to come. Growth stocks are typically those that have a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, robust earnings growth, strong quarterly guidance and the capability to exceed this guidance, and immense volatility. Considering these factors brought together, especially the volatility factor, it can be said that with growth stocks, you either win big or lose quickly, depending on the state of the economy and the probability of a recession hitting the markets.', 'Despite the volatility associated with growth stocks, many investors consider them to be attractive investments, and for good reason. As noted by Brandywine Global in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023, growth stocks, particularly in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, significantly outperformed their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. At the end of 2023, the growth index had raked in returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index lagged much further behind with its 11.5% gain.', 'The review noted a factor of interest. Over the past year, growth stocks performed better than value when long-term interest rates declined, but the opposite was true when long-term interest rates were on the rise.

If you want to skip our overview of the global fertilizer industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. ', ""The fertilizer industry can very well be said to be one of the oldest in the world. The ability of human beings to thrive as a species is linked to collective farming, as the first civilizations were made of people able to coalesce around rivers and other sources of water to grow crops. Since then, the sector has enjoyed the benefits of humanity's progress and grown considerably in volume and value."", 'Fertilizer stocks are typically classified as firms that provide agricultural inputs to farmers. This broader category also includes pesticides, which are chemicals that help plants fight off attacks against external and internal elements like diseases and insects. At the heart of the global fertilizer industry and stocks is the element Nitrogen, as it makes up some of the most commonly used fertilizers in the world, such as ammonia and urea.', 'Additionally, while the global fertilizer industry benefits from using advanced manufacturing processes such as The Haber Process, advances in manufacturing and computing technology have also led to farmers being able to use less fertilizer. For instance, a report from McKinsey & Company tells us that since the application of fertilizers to prepared soil is a relatively simple process, machines are able to evenly spread out the raw material over the soil to prevent wastage.', ""If we're to include these industrial automation stocks in our list of the best agricultural stocks, then the list becomes quite diverse. For instance, in the traditional sense of thinking, one of the world's biggest fertilizer and nitrogen stocks is the Canada based nitrogen and fertilizer company, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR). Nutrien produces millions of tons of phosphate, nitrogen, and other fertilizers."", ""In the industrial automation fertilizer space, the Moline, Illinois based industrial equipment company Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is a notable name. Deere has a market capitalization of $107 billion and several liquid and dry nutrient fertilizer applicators in its product portfolio. It complements these by offering a variety of accessories such as sprayers, and while these might be typically thought of as fertilizer equipment, as we'll explain below, they play a crucial role in agriculture and justify why NYSE:DE can also be categorized as a fertilizer stock."", ""For instance, Deere's ExactShot planting technology touted reducing the need for fertilizer by as much as 60% at the time of its launch last year by placing starter fertilizer directly on top of seeds during the time of planting instead of applying fertilizer in bulk."", 'As a whole, fertilizer stocks are dependent on global supply chains, and as opposed to high growth stocks such as those belonging to the technology sector, they also provide investors with comfort during turbulent economic times. To understand the factors that drive their performance, it can be worthwhile to look at what the professionals are saying. One way to find out institutional investor sentiment is to look at investor letters. And as luck would have it, Insider Monkey painfully compiles investor letters every quarter such as those for the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2023.', 'One such fertilizer stock hedge fund investor letter comes from White Brook Capital Partners. The firm commented on the shares of the Tampa, Florida based fertilizer stock The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), as it shared:', '""Mosaic (MOS) and Green Plains (GPRE), our commodity-sensitive investments, remain substantial positions in the portfolio. The companies are a natural hedge to each other in some ways, as the price of corn is a feedstock for Green Plains while it bolsters the purchasing power of Mosaic’s customers. On the other hand, higher oil prices are a positive for Green Plains, while the opposite is true for Mosaic.', 'The Mosaic thesis didn’t change during 2023. The world’s potash and phosphate needs grow at a ~2% CAGR, and the price for potash and phosphate, which declined from Covid peaks during 2023, is likely to be at least stable in 2024. Mosaic continues to generate substantial free cash flow on a business with lessening capital intensity, and the balance sheet has a very manageable debt load. The Company’s CEO, Jack O’Roarke, announced his retirement at the end of 2023, but I expect the company to go from strength to strength as long-time heir apparent Bruce Bodine leads the company in 2024. I believe the company will continue to return capital to shareholders through enhanced stock buybacks while investing in high-return brownfield opportunities that will continue to grow long-term free cash flow per share. Additionally, should battery manufacturers adopt more phosphate in their batteries as Tesla and Ford have begun to do, it could significantly change the demand dynamics of one of its two products and ensure Mosaic’s significant cash flows years into the future.""', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best fertilizer stocks that hedge funds are laying their hands on.

Because of this long-term mindset and commitment to product innovation, the company is in a position today where it has numerous significant new product launches across the business, helping to accelerate growth and improve profitability. More recently, the market’s infatuation with the promise of GLP-1 drugs has resulted in valuation de-ratings across the medtech industry broadly, to which Medtronic was not immune.

How each case is handled\xa0varies by state courts and law.', ""In a New Jersey Superior Court, for example, Judge Haekyoung Suh recently ordered United's OptumRx to halt the termination of a pharmacy until it completed arbitration."", '""Optum is given great authority regarding termination,"" Suh wrote in her opinion in December, regarding the contract between the PBM and pharmacy.', ""The three largest healthcare companies in the country have a combined market value of more than $640 billion — all of which have their own mail-order prescription service. This has caused the misaligned incentives FTC's Khan referenced, where a PBM is looking for ways to have to pay out less to the pharmacies and direct patients to mail orders."", 'Swichar said the contracts are increasingly unfavorable to pharmacies. Other lawyers are also starting to see the trend.', 'One lawyer, who declined to be quoted in order to protect his clients in ongoing legal cases with PBMs, represents independent pharmacies for a broad array of legal issues. He shared with Yahoo Finance on background that he expects to see one or two termination notices a year. But in 2023, he saw more than half a dozen termination notices, which rose to surpass one dozen in the first quarter of 2024 alone.', ""Pharmacies are audited by PBMs in order to ensure the pharmacy is only getting paid for drugs it actually dispenses and that it isn't overcharging the PBMs and insurers.

In one instance, a pharmacy missed an email from the PBM, prompting the termination notice."", ""When a pharmacy is audited and given a termination notice, it races to thwart the PBM's efforts to shut it down within 60 to 90 days by correcting or defending against the issues cited. There is an appeal process, which usually involves an internal hearing comprised of PBM staff, followed by potential arbitration for further appeal."", 'But amid the rise in termination notices, those avenues for recourse are becoming less meaningful.', 'In a recent email viewed by Yahoo Finance, lawyers who represent independent pharmacies were notified that the internal appeal hearings at Optum are being discontinued. Instead, a panel will review the appeal documentation and simply provide a written decision.', ""PBMs are making matters worse by sending notices to patients that their pharmacies are out of network well before the deadline to rectify the issue — at day 45 out of the 90-day period, for example. This drives patients directly to the PBMs' mail-order services."", ""And there is no law requiring the PBMs to notify patients once the pharmacy resolves the issues, so pharmacies forever lose those customers, NCPA's Pivarunas\xa0explained. The damage is done."", 'In Suh\'s decision in December, she said the PBM had already pushed the pharmacy\'s termination date, showing that ""no immediate harm will result"" in continuing operations. In fact, she said, the pharmacy had demonstrated that termination ""will result in serious harm through loss of customers, disrupted operations, and potential termination of partnerships with physician providers.""', 'That\'s why, Swichar said, ""losing network rights with any one of them will, with almost certainty, put the pharmacy out of business.""', ""Cigna's Express Scripts has previously said that, as of 2022, 35% of its pharmacy network was independent pharmacies, while retail chains accounted for 33% and grocery chains were 32%. Independents also account for 900 million prescriptions per year, compared to 600 million from mail-order."", 'It also claims to be helping independents. ""In rural areas, independent pharmacists are crucial to closing gaps in care created by a shortage of doctors and other medical professions paired with the closure of almost 200 hospitals in recent years,"" the company said.', 'How prevalent the problem is nationwide is hard to quantify through any court system or trade group.', '""The majority of these disputes are resolved by phone, email, or arbitration. The majority of what we go through and what we\'re going through with independent pharmacies is a complete unknown,"" Swichar said.', 'Between low reimbursement rates and the termination notices, pharmacy closures are piling up— despite hundreds of planned retail chain location closures that could have resulted in increased business for the independents. In its annual reports, the NCPA showed that at the end of 2017, there were 21,909 independent pharmacies, and as of June 2023, there were 19,432.', ""The only hope left, Swichar said, is the result of the FTC's probe if its findings favor independents."", 'CVS declined requests for comment from Yahoo Finance, and Cigna did not respond by the time of publication.', 'Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

This marks an increase from the previous period. The company anticipates revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.07 billion for Q2 of fiscal 2024.', 'I also believe that SWKS is cheap on the valuation front in addition to its market cap of around $16 billion.

Before I get into our Q3 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic passing of Kelvin Kiptum last month. Kelvin had just set the Marathon world record in Chicago. He was a world-class athlete and Champion and beloved member of the NIKE family. Kelvin was an inspiration to so many us, and he'll long be remembered and honored for the impact he had both on the running community and beyond. Looking at our business, Q3 performed in line with our expectations. That said, we know NIKE is not performing in our potential. While our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy has driven growth and direct connections with consumers, it's been clear that we need to make some important adjustments."", ""Simply put, we need to make adjustments in four areas. We need to sharpen our focus on sport, we must drive a continuous flow of new product innovation, our brand marketing must become bolder and more distinctive. And while NIKE Direct will continue to play a critical role, we must lead in with our wholesale partners to elevate our brand and grow the total marketplace. And this is exactly what we're doing. Starting last June, we aligned our organization to put the consumer and a sharp focus on sport back at the center of everything we do. We integrated our leadership structure, appointing Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams as Co-Presidents. We've reinvested in consumer-led sport focused teams that are the foundation of our offense, and we're driving our winning formula of creating a relentless flow of innovative product, combined with distinct brand storytelling, delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences."", ""And while we still have much work to do, we are making significant progress. We're well on our way to building a multiyear cycle of innovation that's bringing freshness and newness to consumers. We pulled forward several innovations more than a year, and our intent is to delight consumers and disrupt the industry. Our brand storytelling will leverage our athletes and sport moments to become sharper and bolder, beginning with the Olympics this summer. And we're increasing our investment in wholesale to help us elevate and grow the entire marketplace. We recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer. Most importantly, we're back on our front foot with growing confidence in our innovation pipeline."", ""We know it will take some time to scale these innovations, but we see some early green shoots. And we're also carefully managing our most important franchises for the long-term health. And as a result, our product portfolio will go through a period of transition over the coming quarters. But altogether, we are relentlessly focused on driving NIKE's next chapter of healthy and sustainable growth. And we look forward to sharing our plans in depth at an Investor Day later this year. Now as we said before, our success always starts with innovative product. And so that's where I'm going to focus on today's call. Today, our innovation engine is moving with speed. Our innovation, design and product creation teams are working hand in hand with urgency and creativity."", ""They're leveraging new technologies to be faster, more collaborative and more expansive in their thinking. We have many platforms at NIKE that drive growth. But today, let's go deep on our greatest innovation platform and a true source of competitive advantage. Air. Today, as a platform, Air is a double-digit billion dollar business on its own, larger than some Fortune 500 companies. There's nothing like Air. It's a proprietary technology that lets us iterate and revolutionize. It drives breakthrough performance benefits for athletes and defines the future of sportswear. Air offers stability, resilience and energy return, unlike any other cushioning platform. Simply put, Air helps athletes win. Decade after decade, we've developed new breakthroughs in Air."", ""And as we approach the Olympics in Paris this summer, we continue to innovate with Air with a focus on helping the world's greatest athletes compete and win on sports largest stage. And so this summer, you're going to see Air drive major advancements in measurable performance benefits on the track, on the court and on the pitch. In addition to Alphafly 3, which continues to set the standard for distance racing, you'll see Air new footwear that brings elite performance to everyday runners. You'll see Air in football and basketball footwear in new and more visible ways. And you'll see Air in the fastest track spikes we've ever created. You're going to get a chance to see all of these products, in fact, our full Olympics innovation lineup two weeks from now at our Innovation Ignition events that we'll be hosting in Paris."", ""Now beyond creating leading-edge performance innovation, we also continue to bring new sensations of Air across our business, including our lifestyle portfolio. For instance, Dynamic Air, our newest innovation platform is a true breakthrough delivering a uniquely comfortable sensation with each step. It's a total rethinking of what airbags can be. Historically, airbags have been fixed and static, picture inflatable raft, they compress when you step and then immediately return to their original shape ready for the next step. Dynamic Air changes the game. It unchambers the Air to create a new underfoot sensation that's truly responsive. As the consumer takes a step, our new four-tubed air unit allows air to flow freely between the tubes, responding to the pressure of each unique stride to deliver maximum comfort."", ""We will scale Dynamic Air across many of our leading Air franchises, but it starts with the Air Max Dn, a shoe that offers just the latest example of how we're using Air to craft a new lifestyle franchise. I've been wearing the Dn all week. And in fact, I'm wearing it right now. It really is a unique and great sensation. And what's more, Dn's bold style and design identity is deeply rooted in youth culture and the next generation. We're excited for consumers to experience it. And next week will be Nike's tenth Air Max Day. It will be a day when you see us drive an integrated offense of innovation, storytelling and consumer activations that we're very excited about. Air Max Dn will be debuting in more than 4,000 stores globally on Air Max Day, creating impact like we haven't seen in years."", ""When we teased Dn last month, we saw a rise in other Air Max franchises. This is common. Our experience has been that when we launch a strong new product, it creates energy for the whole family. It all speaks to the confidence we feel when we look at our overall innovation engine and pipeline from Air to the rest of the portfolio. Now earlier, I mentioned the impact Nike can have as we sharpen our focus on sport, and the world got a great reminder of that today with the announcement of the awarding of the German football contract. I was fortunate enough to be in Germany for our pitch earlier this week, and I can tell you it was simply NIKE at its very best. It started with our deep and unparalleled commitment to sport. We are the world's leading sports brand, the largest sports brand, the leader in football, the world's most popular sport."", ""Our focus started with product innovation, both on the pitch with unmatched kits and footwear that popped and had style and performance and extended into distinct and fashionable lifestyle design. Our ability to tell stories shown through to make the German team a global brand and make their athletes global heroes and our ability to expand the game, expanding the women's football game and inviting youth culture into football, all mattered. It was a remarkable team effort and a great proof point that when NIKE brings out our best, no one can beat us. And so we feel deeply honored and privileged to partner with the German Football Federation starting in 2027. Before wrapping up, let me touch on something else that's core to our DNA as a company, NIKE'S purpose."", ""Purpose will always be our foundation and remains deeply embedded in our strategy. We're defined by our commitment to the future of sport and service to athletes around the globe and purpose continues to guide us and redefine our own potential for positive impact in the world. We're pleased with the progress we've made against our 2025 purpose targets across representation, sustainability and community. To learn more, please see our recently released FY '23 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report. In the end, we're acting with urgency as we make the adjustments needed to compete and win. And I'd like to conclude by saying that I deeply appreciate how much our team has kept our focus on delivering results amid macro volatility and an organizational restructure."", ""This has been a difficult time for our organization, and I feel truly grateful for our teammates who dedicated and demonstrated such dedication and commitment to our work together. It's thanks to them that I feel so confident in NIKE's future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."", ""Matthew Friend: Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's third quarter showcased the operating discipline of our teams as we delivered revenues up slightly on top of the prior year's double-digit growth, outperforming our expectations in North America and more than offsetting dynamic conditions in some other geographies. We executed well to recapture transitory cost headwinds and expand gross margins even in a promotional environment. Our inventory position remains healthy with total marketplace units down double digits versus the prior year and weeks of supply at their lowest levels since the pandemic. Most importantly, our teams are focused on what matters most to capture the strong growth opportunity we see in the marketplace."", 'This means creating more value for consumers by scaling new product innovation, with greater brand impact across the full marketplace with even more inspiration through sport and our athletes. Last quarter, we highlighted that particularly in an uneven macro environment, newness and innovation are what drives brand distinction. Consumers are moving quickly to access new products. Trends are igniting in different places and rapidly spreading around the world. NIKE needs to be faster. And so we are accelerating a multiyear innovation cycle. And while our new product cycle is just getting underway, this quarter showed that we are on the right track. Since the start of this fiscal year, new and updated footwear models have grown into a majority of our top 20 growing footwear franchises in Q3.', ""Added up, footwear products introduced over the past several quarters are on track to generate a multibillion dollar run rate on an annual basis, and we see even more opportunity ahead. On the whole, we see momentum where we are focused most. Performance footwear grew high single digits this quarter, with double-digit growth from $100-plus franchises, including Kobe and Ja in basketball, Metcon And Motiva in fitness and Structure and Vomero in running. Women's fitness footwear grew double digits and key apparel franchises such as $100-plus leggings, continued scaling with strong sell-through. New product journeys from Book 1 to Vomero 5 and V2K, to Lunar Roam and Travis Scott Jordan Jumpman Jack drove consumer energy and ahead of a new wave of Nike Air innovation, the Air Zoom Alphafly 3 debuted with a marathon world record and sellout launches across multiple markets around the world."", 'As you heard from John, we believe the Paris Olympics will serve as a catalyst for our brands as we launch our newest Nike Air innovations for athletes. Most importantly, this is just the beginning. With a growing portfolio of new concepts, platforms and capabilities, our innovation teams are well positioned to continue driving breakthroughs in performance and lifestyle over the coming years. Now to maximize the impact of our new product cycle, we are accelerating several important actions lined up against key brand and sports moments. First, we are elevating and differentiating the consumer experience with our brands at retail, especially as consumers continue to shift back into physical stores. This includes increased investment to support strong seasonal retail marketing execution, breadth and depth of assortment and elevated service and product presentation.', ""You heard John say that we will initially launch the Air Max Dn next week at more than 4,000 doors. We will increasingly leverage our full portfolio of thousands of physical doors to position our newest products in the path of consumers. Second, we are sharpening our brand storytelling to tell fewer, bigger stories with greater reach. We will focus our demand creation investments to elevate our brand and most distinctive products, leading with the voice of the athlete, amplifying our new innovation, and engaging consumers at the point of sale. As we look forward, we see that our Olympics Air for Athletes campaign will be the boldest expression of NIKE's brand voice in many years. Third, we are in the midst of shifting our product portfolio towards newness and innovation."", ""Last quarter, we spoke of our intentional actions to reduce marketplace supply of certain key franchises to ensure they remain healthy and strong, while feeding and scaling new products. Given the way consumers are responding to our newest product journeys, even amidst a more promotional environment, we have decided to accelerate our actions. For example, we are pulling back supply of classics, such as the Air Force 1, and we're reducing supply of Pegasus ahead of launching new innovation in the Peg 41. We've been here before. 12 months ago, our basketball portfolio was meaningfully impacted when we exited a key signature franchise. Since then, we've more than offset that impact by scaling innovation with the GT series, introducing newness to consumers in Ja, Sabrina, Kobe and Book and returned to strong double-digit growth this quarter in basketball."", 'Looking ahead, we expect lifecycle management of key product franchises to create some near-term headwinds, particularly on digital. However, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to fuel brand momentum and return to stronger long-term growth. Last, while we continue to bring operational discipline as we manage our business through these shifts and a multiyear period of higher cost inflation, we are also positioning NIKE for the future. This includes restructuring our organization to sharpen our focus and increase our investment on the consumer and sport, which we believe will fuel our next phase of long-term growth. This quarter, we began streamlining support and operating functions, reducing management layers and shifting more of our resources towards consumer-facing activities.', ""In particular, we are increasing investment in areas such as design, product creation, merchandising, brand and our ground game to drive greater impact for consumers, dimensions of sport and the marketplace. Overall, our focus is on allocating our resources to drive more return while building an operating model with greater speed and better cost productivity as we grow. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. third quarter results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue was up slightly on a reported and currency-neutral basis with low single-digit growth in the NIKE brand, partially offset by declines at Converse. As a reminder, this follows 14% reported and 19% currency-neutral growth one year ago, as we were liquidating excess inventory in Q3 of fiscal '23. NIKE Direct was up slightly versus the prior year, with NIKE stores up 6% and NIKE Digital down 4%, wholesale grew 3%."", 'Gross margins expanded 150 basis points to 44.8% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates and improvements in supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs. This also includes 50 basis points of negative impact from restructuring charges. SG&A grew 7% on a reported basis as increased investments in demand creation was partially offset by disciplined expense management. This quarter, SG&A was also impacted by approximately $340 million in restructuring charges. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.5% compared to 16% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.77. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been $0.98, up 24% versus the prior year.', ""Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct grew 2% with NIKE stores up 3% and NIKE Digital up 1%. Wholesale grew 5% and EBIT grew 18% on a reported basis. This builds on extraordinary growth in the prior year, with North America revenue up 27%, including NIKE Direct up 23% and wholesale up 32% in Q3 of fiscal '23. This quarter, we exceeded our expectations in North America with strong holiday sales, lighter markdowns than our competitors and unit growth versus the prior year. Inventory is also down double digits at the end of Q3. Kids grew double digits across footwear and apparel with seasonal fleece and performance footwear resonating. We also saw positive momentum in women's lifestyle and fitness with strong growth from the Dunk, free Metcon and retro running styles."", ""Jordan Remix and Sport Performance grew double digits. And in running, Structure, Vomero and the Invincible delivered double-digit growth. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 4% as NIKE stores grew 6% and NIKE Digital declined 10%. Wholesale was down 5% and EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results compare to tremendous growth in Q3 of fiscal '23 when EMEA revenue was up 26%, NIKE Direct was up 39% and wholesale was up 20%. However, sales in the geography fell short of our expectations this quarter as we navigated increased macro volatility and softening consumer demand. That said, newness and brand distinction continues to fuel momentum in EMEA. In running, [self] Alphafly 3's launch energized our road racing portfolio."", ""In Lifestyle, P-6000 and Vomero 5 continue to scale, and fitness grew double digits as we activated our ground game with brand activations and our trainer network. Overall, inventory remains healthy with units down double digits versus the prior year. And as we look forward, we see the launch of Air Max Dn Euro Champs '24 and the Paris Olympics as opportunities to create near-term brand momentum despite a challenging consumer backdrop. In Greater China, Q3 revenue grew 6%, in line with our revised expectations that we shared at the end of last quarter. NIKE Direct declined 1% with NIKE stores growing 6% and NIKE Digital declining 13%. Wholesale grew 12%. EBIT grew 3% on a reported basis with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds."", ""Chinese New Year sales grew year-over-year with our NIKE and Jordan Year of the Dragon Express Lane collections driving excellent sell-through. And retail sales with our partners grew double digits in Q3 versus the prior year. Kids led our growth in the quarter with performance dimensions up strong double digits. In basketball, Book 1, Kobe and G.T. Cut 3 launch with strong sell-through. In running, the Structure, the Invincible and the Vomero drove strong growth this quarter. And the Jordan brand delivered double-digit growth in women's and kids with consumer anticipation building ahead of this week's opening of Jordan World of Flight Beijing, which will be the brand's first pinnacle retail concept in China. In APLA, Q3 revenue grew 4%. NIKE Direct grew 4% with NIKE stores up 18% and NIKE Digital declining 6%."", ""Wholesale grew 3% and EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. In Central and South America, we delivered double-digit growth and improved return on sales in the first full year of our shift to a distributor model. In Mexico, we gained brand strength and momentum with strong growth in football. And in Japan, running grew double digits. Across the APLA, football and basketball grew double digits, fueled by the Mercurial, LeBron and the GT series. And women's holistic fitness grew across all channels with Motiva and statement leggings, in particular, resonating. Now let me turn to our financial outlook. As we look forward, we are driving earnings growth and offsetting softer second half revenue with strong gross margin execution, disciplined cost controls and healthy and more productive inventory levels across the marketplace."", 'Excluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on the full year earnings outlook that we communicated at the beginning of this fiscal year. More specifically, for the full year, we continue to expect revenue to grow approximately 1%. We now expect Q4 revenue to be up slightly reflecting some shipment timing benefits in Q3 and lower digital growth due to franchise lifecycle management. Q4 also has one point of negative impact on reported revenue from a stronger U.S. dollar. Moving down the P&L. I will note that our guidance includes restructuring charges of approximately $450 million in our second half, with $403 million incurred in the third quarter. This primarily impacts SG&A with approximately 15 basis points of impact to full year gross margins.', 'We expect Q4 gross margins to expand approximately 160 to 180 basis points. This guidance continues to reflect benefits from strategic price increases, lower ocean freight rates, lower product input costs and improved supply chain efficiency. Our outlook is now partially offset by higher markdowns, reduced benefits from channel mix due to franchise lifecycle management and worsening foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, this translates into gross margins expanding approximately 120 basis points, including approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect Q4 SG&A to be down slightly versus the prior year, including restructuring charges, reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance. For the full year, this translates into SG&A growing low single digits, including restructuring charges, also reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance.', ""Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, we expect full year SG&A to be roughly flat. Our guidance for other income and expense and our effective tax rate remain unchanged. Additionally, given the strategic actions we walked through earlier, I want to share some early thoughts on how we are planning for our next fiscal year. First, we expect revenue and earnings to grow versus the prior year, with operating margins expanding, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges in fiscal '24. However, we are prudently planning for revenue in the first half of the fiscal year to be down low single digits. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects near-term headwinds from lifecycle management of our key product franchises, more than offsetting the scaling of new products as we shift our product portfolio toward newness and innovation."", ""This also continues to reflect the subdued macro outlook around the world. Most importantly, we are focused on amplifying brand strength and consumer impact, which is the foundation for how we drive sustainable long-term growth. Looking ahead, we are confident in our product pipeline for fiscal '25 and the momentum that we will build throughout the year, moment-by-moment, creating brand impact and deep consumer connection through sport. With that, let's open up the call for questions."", 'See also 15 Best Places in Pennsylvania for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security and Corporate Insiders are Dumping These 11 Tech Stocks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Demand is off the charts for medications including Ozempic, Rybelsus, Saxenda, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Jardiance, and Zepbound. That's a long list of treatments, isn't it?"", 'What you might not know, however, is that just two companies, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), developed all the medications above. Indeed, both companies have made significant inroads in treating diabetes and obesity patients thanks to breakthroughs in compounds known as semaglutide and tirzepatide.', ""However, an emerging biotech could be on their heels, preparing to disrupt Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Let's dig into the full picture and assess what's going on."", 'Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) is a small biotech company looking to develop treatments for metabolic and endocrine disorders.', ""Many other pharmaceutical companies have been trying to enter the red-hot weight-loss market, but just can't seem to get things right. But a few weeks ago, Viking announced positive indications from a phase 2 clinical trial for its dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist VK2735. The hype over the company's obesity candidate caused investors to send shares of Viking soaring."", 'Given the success of the phase 2 trial, I see a couple of obvious outcomes for Viking. The first is that the company moves swiftly into a phase 3 trial, and works closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to bring its obesity candidate to market.', 'The second possible outcome is more interesting. Given the positive momentum Viking is experiencing, the company may be a ripe acquisition target, with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) possibly\xa0 a suitable candidate to buy out Viking.', ""On the surface, this looks like a pretty good idea: Pfizer has been subject to setbacks as it looks to enter the realm of weight-loss medications.

Maybe one day. But I think the more likely outcome is that if Viking brings its obesity drug to market, it will help spur increasing competition, which could result in further gains for all three pharmaceutical businesses.', ""The addressable market for GLP-1 treatments could reach $100 billion by 2030, according to research conducted by J.P. Morgan. While Viking's prospects currently look encouraging, it's likely to be years before its obesity drug has met all requirements from the FDA to receive approval. And even if that happens, the size of the market tells me there are likely to be multiple winners in the long run."", ""One of the most important details to understand about Viking is that the company is still a clinical-stage biotech operation. In essence, it's spending money on research and development in hopes of bringing a blockbuster drug to market. But with no tangible revenue, Viking remains speculative right now."", 'By contrast, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are already established players in the diabetes and obesity-care markets.

The company projects an additional $20 billion per year in revenue by 2030 from new product launches and new indications for existing products. That's more than enough to offset the revenue decline from the looming patent cliff. Pfizer also anticipates another $25 billion in new revenue from business development deals by 2030."", 'All of this translates to solid growth.

Wood initiated a position in the big drugmaker for her Ark Genomic Innovation ETF in 2021. However, she has sold this high-yield dividend stock in recent months. Should you sell Pfizer too?', ""At the end of 2023, Wood's Ark Genomic Innovation ETF owned nearly 500,000 shares of Pfizer.

Over the subsequent week, the selling continued.', ""Today, the Ark Genomic Innovation ETF doesn't list Pfizer among its 40-plus holdings. After owning the big pharma stock for over two years, Wood appears to have said farewell to Pfizer."", ""These moves raise the question: Why doesn't Wood like Pfizer anymore? One answer can be found simply by looking at the company's stock chart since she first purchased shares in the third quarter of 2021."", ""Stocks don't perform as dismally as Pfizer has for no reason, though. There are two underlying causes behind the steep plunge for the big pharma stock."", ""First, sales for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral therapy Paxlovid have tanked. The demand for these products has declined sharply as the world has moved into a post-pandemic phase. In the U.S., the transition from the federal government paying for the vaccines to a private market also impacted sales."", 'Second, Pfizer faces a major patent cliff over the next several years.

However, she might not have anticipated the big drop in COVID-19 sales. Wood also perhaps was betting that Pfizer would emerge as a big winner in the obesity market.

The company doesn't have to deliver much share price growth to give investors attractive total returns with that juicy dividend.

The company's new products and new indications for existing products should generate more than enough additional revenue to make up for the upcoming patent cliff. Pfizer's business development deals, including the recent acquisition of Seagen, should contribute another $25 billion per year in new annual revenue by 2030."", ""Wood's decision to bid farewell to Pfizer might be the best move for Ark Invest.

He noted that the Fed would remain committed to its ""dual mandate"" to promote ""maximum employment and stable prices"" to the population of the United States. While Powell spoke about the resilience of the US economy so far in 2024, he also commented on the fact that inflation being reduced is not an assured development for the year as of yet. The Fed\'s March decision also highlighted that the Fed would maintain its federal funds rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Additionally, Powell stated that the Fed will also continue to remain committed to bringing US inflation down to the Fed\'s 2% target.', ""While the Fed meeting this March did not pinpoint any month for potential rate cuts this year, many financial professionals expect the first rate cut of 2024 to come in June. Additionally, the Fed is currently anticipating a total of three rate cuts this year, though this may be subject to change depending on external factors influencing the state of the US economy. Chairman Powell noted in the March press conference that high interest rates also impacted business investment in the US throughout 2023. Considering this, keeping updated on the Fed's latest moves in the rate cut department can be vital for investors in the US today."", ""After the Fed's announcements, US equities and the S&P 500 rallied to record levels. During times of economic uncertainty, investors may be considering where to put their money to ensure higher returns and profitability for themselves and their portfolios. We believe that a good place to start would be the type of stocks that are well-rounded and renowned in the market, particularly stocks with higher market capitalizations, that is, large-cap stocks. This assumption comes from the fact that these stocks have much to offer to investors, both in terms of market capitalization, which typically ranges from $10 billion to $200 billion in the large-cap bracket and in terms of revenue growth."", ""By way of example, let's look at the earnings brought in by some of the stocks on our list below.

These are merely three examples of the value and potential of large-cap stocks, and yet an even more exciting prospect for investors in today's market may be the rise of some of the most undervalued stocks in this group since these stocks would offer investors the chance to buy into attractive stock opportunities offering more value than many other stocks in the market.

Rising interest set the stage for economic lethargy, while an inverted yield curve threatened an outright recession. Such a backdrop makes owning already risky financial technology names even riskier."", ""A funny thing happened on the road to inevitable doom, however -- the global economy didn't implode. Most regions' economies are doing reasonably well. The World Economic Forum is calling for a worldwide economic growth rate of 3.1% this year, in fact, before accelerating to a pace of 3.2% next year. The yield curve continues its trek back toward being un-inverted too; each day it makes this progress raises the odds of a so-called soft landing rather than a full-blown meltdown. That's bullish for most stocks, but it's particularly bullish for economically sensitive fintech names."", ""Here's a closer look at three fintech stocks that could lead the group's bullish charge all the way through 2030. That's how long recently rekindled economic growth could last, presuming the world's banking and political leaders don't stand in the way."", ""There's no denying the original fintech name's very-highest-growth days are in the past. But PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is hardly a has-been."", 'PayPal is of course an online payment and mobile wallet platform. It arguably created and defined what a digital payment service should be, in fact, and then became the name in this space to beat.', ""The thing is, rivals did eventually start creeping onto this company's turf, and they never really stopped. That's why PayPal shares performed so poorly beginning in late 2021 after a heroic run-up from their early 2020 low. Not only was the e-commerce boom stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic starting to cool off, but it was also a time when cryptocurrency-based payment platforms began capturing consumers' as well as investors' attention. Many investors feared the worst for PayPal."", ""It's now clear those fears were mostly unmerited. Last quarter's revenue was up 8% year over year, capping off full-year top-line growth of 8%. Although the total number of active PayPal users didn't grow, the number of times these users utilized PayPal's service to make a payment improved 14% on a year-over-year basis. The analyst community is calling for comparable sales growth this year and next, with earnings growth expected to roll in at around the same pace."", ""That's nowhere near the sort of growth PayPal was experiencing in its heyday. The entire online payment and mobile wallet market has matured, making growth tougher to come by."", ""What this company may lack in future growth potential, however, it more than makes up for in dominance of a market that's set to expand due to a combination of population growth, the increasing proliferation of web connectivity, and a growing willingness to use purely digital payment options (as opposed to payment cards). Capital One estimates PayPal still controls on the order of a market-leading 45% of the electronic payments market."", ""Consumers' growing interest in digital financial services isn't just a boon for PayPal, however. It's impacting the entirety of the banking industry. Bank of America reports three-fourths of its customers now routinely use at least one of its digital banking tools, for instance, while roughly half of any product and service sales made to consumer banking customers last quarter happened online. In this same vein, the American Bankers Association says the most common way U.S. consumers now check their bank account balance is with a mobile app. Indeed, data gathered by JP Morgan Chase's Chase Bank indicates that 62% of consumers feel they couldn't live without their banking app, while nearly 80% of these people use their banking app at least once per week."", ""As was the case with shopping, the world's moving more and more of its banking business online."", ""Enter SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI). Not only is it an online bank, it's only online -- there are no branches. This hasn't limited its offerings, though. Customers enjoy access to every option a consumer would expect to find available at a brick-and-mortar bank, including checking and savings accounts, loans, investments, credit cards, and even insurance."", ""And people are responding to this relatively new kind of banking. SoFi now boasts a little over 7.5 million customers, more than doubling its count from just a couple of years back. Indeed, the company's expanded its customer base in every single quarter going all the way back to the first quarter of 2020."", ""SoFi's not yet reliably profitable, but analysts expect it to report its first full-year profit in 2024 after swinging to its first quarterly profit in the final quarter of last year. That could prove catalytic for this stock that's been lethargic for the past couple of years."", 'Last but not least, add MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) to your list of fintech stocks that could outperform most of its peers between now and 2030.', ""Don't worry if you've never heard of it -- if you live in North America, you've no reason to. That's because the company strictly serves the Latin American market with its suite of fintech solutions. It's often called the Amazon of Latin America, in fact, although that description doesn't do it justice. MercadoLibre is just as akin to the aforementioned PayPal as well as to the online auction site eBay."", ""Although the internet and mobile phones have existed in South America for about as long as they have anywhere else, neither were as common there as they may have been in other parts of the world until recently. For perspective, Americas Market Intelligence says Latin America's e-commerce market expanded 36% in 2021 before accelerating to a growth pace of 39% in 2022, as infrastructure growth finally caught up with demand."", ""The thing is, there's still lots of room for more of this growth. Americas Market Intelligence is looking for 24% growth in Latin America's e-commerce market this year, with another 21% growth in the cards for next year."", ""Helping drive this acceleration is the past and present development of the region's mobile connectivity. Only 60% of the continent's residents owned a mobile device capable of connecting to the web as of 2020, according to research outfit GSMA. Even with the ongoing availability and adoption of mobile phones, though, only 67% of Latin America's population is expected to have regular access to mobile internet by the end of next year."", ""This of course bodes well for MercadoLibre's long-term potential ... not that investors will have to wait until 2030 for their patience to start paying off.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Royal Caribbean Cruises had debt of US$21.1b at the end of December 2023, a reduction from US$23.0b over a year. However, it also had US$498.0m in cash, and so its net debt is US$20.6b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Royal Caribbean Cruises had liabilities of US$9.40b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$20.8b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$498.0m and US$405.0m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$29.3b.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$34.9b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""While we wouldn't worry about Royal Caribbean Cruises's net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.7, we think its super-low interest cover of 2.1 times is a sign of high leverage. So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately. One redeeming factor for Royal Caribbean Cruises is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of US$2.9b, over the last twelve months. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Royal Caribbean Cruises can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow. Looking at the most recent year, Royal Caribbean Cruises recorded free cash flow of 20% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness."", ""On the face of it, Royal Caribbean Cruises's net debt to EBITDA left us tentative about the stock, and its interest cover was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. Having said that, its ability to grow its EBIT isn't such a worry. Overall, we think it's fair to say that Royal Caribbean Cruises has enough debt that there are some real risks around the balance sheet. If all goes well, that should boost returns, but on the flip side, the risk of permanent capital loss is elevated by the debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Royal Caribbean Cruises (1 is a bit concerning)  you should be aware of."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Undervalued Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.', 'At the end of last year, when the Federal Reserve made optimistic comments on the state of the US economy and Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the Fed had managed to make good progress towards reaching its 2% inflation goal, the US equity markets entered into what many began to call an ""everything rally."" According to a Factor Performance Analysis report published by Confluence Technologies this January, this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets, as opposed to value and yield. As a result, growth and volatility significantly outperformed value and yield in both the fourth quarter and generally in 2023 as well.', 'Today, stocks in the semiconductors, cloud computing, and biotechnology sectors are making up a significant chunk of growth stocks. These sectors are some of the best performers in the market so far this year, making them attractive investments for a long time to come. Growth stocks are typically those that have a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, robust earnings growth, strong quarterly guidance and the capability to exceed this guidance, and immense volatility. Considering these factors brought together, especially the volatility factor, it can be said that with growth stocks, you either win big or lose quickly, depending on the state of the economy and the probability of a recession hitting the markets.', 'Despite the volatility associated with growth stocks, many investors consider them to be attractive investments, and for good reason. As noted by Brandywine Global in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023, growth stocks, particularly in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, significantly outperformed their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. At the end of 2023, the growth index had raked in returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index lagged much further behind with its 11.5% gain.', 'The review noted a factor of interest. Over the past year, growth stocks performed better than value when long-term interest rates declined, but the opposite was true when long-term interest rates were on the rise. Resultantly, when interest rates began to fall in the fourth quarter of 2023, growth stocks found themselves as the best performers in the market. Although initially, the growth rally was spearheaded predominantly by large or mega-cap tech stocks, later in 2023 and even now in 2024, the focus shifted from a select few tech names to include stocks in our market capitalization brackets and sectors as well. As a result, investors now have a much more diverse range of stocks to choose from when dealing with their growth stock portfolios.', 'According to Brandywine Global, in 2023, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

However, the Chinese yuan saw gains, buoyed by indications of official backing. The Topix index in Japan was one of the hardest hit, contributing to the overall dip in a regional equity benchmark for the second consecutive session. The decline followed cautionary remarks from Japan's top currency authority, advising against speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi index also registered a decrease, while Australian stocks saw modest gains. In Europe and the United States, futures for equity markets showed minimal movement.

Investors are also closely monitoring inflation data, including the preferred gauge of the Federal Reserve, expected to be released later in the week. These figures will provide insights into the state of inflationary pressures, which could influence central bank policies and market sentiment. The developments in Asian markets underscore the continued influence of geopolitical and economic factors on global financial markets. As uncertainties persist, investors remain vigilant, seeking cues from both domestic and international events to inform their trading strategies and investment decisions. Reuters reports that the U.S. stock market is broadening its rally beyond the dominant tech and growth stocks, thanks to a positive economic outlook and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. Sectors like financials, industrials, and energy are now outperforming, easing concerns about overreliance on a few stocks. The Fed's confidence in controlling inflation and potential rate cuts has further boosted investor sentiment. Despite positive indicators in the labor market, concerns persist about wage gains and inflation, which could impact the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains optimistic about the overall strength of the labor market but acknowledges the need for careful monitoring. However, upcoming inflation data and portfolio adjustments by fund managers may introduce volatility. While tech giants continue to play a significant role in market gains, their dominance has decreased compared to last year. This broader rally signifies a healthier market, less susceptible to corrections. Despite the overall positive trend, some areas like small-cap stocks remain subdued, although they could benefit from the Fed's accommodative stance.

Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:', '13% = US$12b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Verizon Communications has a better ROE than the average (9.2%) in the Telecom industry.', ""That's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 5 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications."", 'Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.62. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

He noted that the Fed would remain committed to its ""dual mandate"" to promote ""maximum employment and stable prices"" to the population of the United States. While Powell spoke about the resilience of the US economy so far in 2024, he also commented on the fact that inflation being reduced is not an assured development for the year as of yet. The Fed\'s March decision also highlighted that the Fed would maintain its federal funds rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Additionally, Powell stated that the Fed will also continue to remain committed to bringing US inflation down to the Fed\'s 2% target.', ""While the Fed meeting this March did not pinpoint any month for potential rate cuts this year, many financial professionals expect the first rate cut of 2024 to come in June. Additionally, the Fed is currently anticipating a total of three rate cuts this year, though this may be subject to change depending on external factors influencing the state of the US economy. Chairman Powell noted in the March press conference that high interest rates also impacted business investment in the US throughout 2023. Considering this, keeping updated on the Fed's latest moves in the rate cut department can be vital for investors in the US today."", ""After the Fed's announcements, US equities and the S&P 500 rallied to record levels. During times of economic uncertainty, investors may be considering where to put their money to ensure higher returns and profitability for themselves and their portfolios. We believe that a good place to start would be the type of stocks that are well-rounded and renowned in the market, particularly stocks with higher market capitalizations, that is, large-cap stocks. This assumption comes from the fact that these stocks have much to offer to investors, both in terms of market capitalization, which typically ranges from $10 billion to $200 billion in the large-cap bracket and in terms of revenue growth."", ""By way of example, let's look at the earnings brought in by some of the stocks on our list below.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) brought in an EPS of $0.54, beating estimates by $0.09, while its $15.4 billion revenue beat estimates by $231.1 million. Finally, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) had an EPS of $3.11 for the fourth quarter, beating estimates by $0.33. The company's revenue came in at $2.4 billion and beat estimates by $35.3 million. These are merely three examples of the value and potential of large-cap stocks, and yet an even more exciting prospect for investors in today's market may be the rise of some of the most undervalued stocks in this group since these stocks would offer investors the chance to buy into attractive stock opportunities offering more value than many other stocks in the market.

He never had a single losing year, and he returned an average of 30% annually to clients. Very few Wall Street money managers have a track record half that good, and that makes Druckenmiller an excellent case study for investors.', 'Today, he manages his multibillion-dollar fortune through the Duquesne Family Office. As of the quarter ended in December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his portfolio invested in two ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 9.1% and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) accounted for 12% of his invested assets. The size of those positions is a clear sign of high conviction.', 'Are Nvidia and Microsoft still worthwhile investments?', 'Nvidia reported phenomenal financial results for the fourth quarter, crushing estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue soared 265% to $22.1 billion on triple-digit sales growth in the data center and professional visualization segments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income skyrocketed 486% to $5.16 per diluted share as gross margin expanded more than 10 percentage points due to pricing power and a scaling software business, which comes with even higher margins than Nvidia hardware.', 'The company is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in handling computer graphics and complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, Nvidia holds a more-than-95% market share in workstation graphics, and an 80%-plus\xa0share in AI chips.', 'But the company is truly formidable because it has expanded into the adjacent data center markets of high-performance networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services -- all purpose-built for AI.', 'CEO Jensen Huang highlighted that strategy at the annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) the company hosted recently. ""Nvidia doesn\'t build chips. Nvidia builds data centers,"" Huang said. He continued: ""Nvidia\'s opportunity is not the GPU opportunity. A lot of people make GPUs. We\'re pursuing the data center market.""', 'That strategy not only creates monetization possibilities beyond GPUs, but also reduces friction for customers. As Huang explained, Nvidia essentially sells ready-made data centers purpose-built for powering AI workloads.', 'With that in mind, Nvidia values its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share by 35% annually over the next five years. While impressive, that consensus estimate still makes its current valuation of 77 times earnings look quite expensive.', 'Personally, I would wait for a much cheaper entry point before purchasing Nvidia stock, and I say that as a current shareholder.', 'This tech giant posted strong financial results for the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 18% to $62 billion on solid sales growth in commercial software and cloud computing services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped 26% to $2.93 per diluted share due to disciplined expense management. Management guided for 14% to 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, and investors can expect similar results in the future as the company leans into AI.', 'Microsoft dominates the software-as-a-service market due in large part to success with its office productivity (Microsoft 365), enterprise resource management (Dynamics 365), and cybersecurity products. The company has introduced generative AI copilots that automate tasks across those software categories. For instance, Microsoft 365 Copilot can draft text in Word, create presentations in PowerPoint, and analyze data in Excel. Management expects those generative AI copilots to contribute more significantly to revenue in the future.', 'Meanwhile, Microsoft is also gaining market share in cloud computing. Its Azure unit accounted for 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the fourth quarter, up nearly 2 percentage points from the prior year. CEO Satya Nadella attributes those share gains to investments in AI, most notably its partnership with OpenAI. Specifically, Microsoft is the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI, and Azure customers can build custom generative AI applications using OpenAI large language models like GPT-4, the cognitive engine behind ChatGPT Plus.', 'Going forward, the software-as-a-service market is forecast to grow by 13.7% annually, and the cloud computing market is projected to expand at a 14.1% annualized rate during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at generating annual revenue growth in the low teens through the end of the decade. Investors can expect slightly faster growth on the bottom line due share buybacks and continued focus on cost control.', 'Indeed, Wall Street expects Microsoft to boost its earnings per share by 16% annually over the next five years. But that consensus forecast makes the current valuation of nearly 39 times earnings look quite expensive. Microsoft is an excellent company with strong growth prospects, but I would be surprised to see this Magnificent Seven stock beat the market over the next five years from its current price.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock.

Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $208.90, but it is currently trading at US$156 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Genuine Parts’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.', ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

Over the last one, three, five and ten years, however, Disney has woefully underperformed its potential and its peers,2 costing shareholders more than $200 billion in value.3', 'Accordingly, Trian believes that change is needed. Ahead of the Disney annual meeting of shareholders on April 3, 2024, Trian encourages all shareholders to vote FOR its two candidates, Mr. Peltz and Mr. Rasulo, and to withhold support from two incumbent directors, Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael B.G. Froman.', 'This Campaign is About the Board ', 'Trian believes Disney’s problems lay at the feet of the Board, which lacks focus, alignment and accountability. Although the Board members are accomplished professionals, they are extraordinarily busy, have invested almost none of their own money in Disney stock and have failed to heed investor input. The result has been questionable strategic and capital allocation decisions, including the investment of $200 billion of capital without any\xa0discernible return, the demonstrable lack of alignment between executive compensation4 and shareholder value creation and financial results in the most recent year that pale in comparison to the results five years ago.5', 'Most recently, the Board botched its most important job – CEO succession – by installing Bob Chapek in that role seemingly without appropriate vetting or oversight.6 The Board then renewed Mr. Chapek’s contract just months before firing him for poor performance. Ultimately, the Board had to call Bob Iger out of retirement to fill the void.', 'In this election contest, Disney has emphasized that Mr. Iger is admired and respected (including, for example, by service providers7 and advisors8), which we do not doubt. Trian supports Mr. Iger as a candidate for the Board and as CEO. That Disney spends so much time and ink defending Mr. Iger – while saying almost nothing about the two director candidates whose reelection Trian is challenging – is both troubling and telling. This campaign is not about Mr. Iger, nor is it a referendum on his leadership. And in all events, Disney is, and must be, more than just one person, especially one whose contract expires in less than two short years.', 'This election is a board election and the question before shareholders is: who should serve on the Board, helping the company on behalf of shareholders?', 'We have nominated two candidates, Mr. Peltz and Mr. Rasulo, who have a shareholder mindset, extensive, relevant experience and a willingness to ask tough questions and set demanding goals. Mr. Peltz has served on eleven public company boards, including at some of the most respected companies in the world. Mr. Rasulo is the former Chief Financial Officer of Disney and knows the business well. Disney’s board seemingly does not want their help – claiming they will be “disruptive” – and prefers instead its hand-selected incumbents, an expert in foreign affairs and an advisor to wealthy families.', 'Choosing between these slates, and voting for change versus more of the same, is really what this election is about.', 'Our Nominees Will Work Constructively with the Board', 'Our nominees’ goal is to delight Disney’s customers and to enhance value for all shareholders.

Mr. Rasulo and Mr. Iger worked side-by-side every day for more than five years as CFO and CEO, collaborating for the good of Disney shareholders. If elected, Mr. Rasulo would bring his extensive knowledge of Disney and its culture, people, operations and customers to the boardroom, and be an independent source of knowledge about the industry and the company.', 'In 2019, Mr. Peltz was asked by Mr. Iger to address the Disney Board about shareholder sentiment in the media industry. Mr. Peltz was happy to do so, and the discussion was seemingly productive and interactive.', 'More generally, Mr. Peltz has a reputation as a productive and insightful corporate director. His colleagues on corporate boards, across industries, have regularly renominated him as a director, and he has been elected by shareholders more than 50 times to serve as their representative – almost always garnering more than 90% of the vote.9 He did not amass that record by being disruptive or unproductive.', 'Disney knows from its own experience that Mr. Peltz is a willing and helpful collaborator. But if there were any doubt, last week, thirteen of Mr. Peltz’s current and former colleagues wrote an open letter to Disney’s Board in which they said of Mr. Peltz that he:', '“entered the boardroom every meeting with an open mind, a focus on growth for the benefit of stakeholders and a commitment to working constructively towards our common goal of creating long-term shareholder value.”10', 'Our Nominees Can Help Disney', 'We believe that reelecting the existing Board will have the predictable effect of leading to more of the same: questionable strategic and capital allocation decisions, poor executive compensation alignment and suboptimal succession planning.', 'Trian is convinced that Mr. Peltz and Mr. Rasulo can assist Disney with its challenges and help ensure a brighter future. We are not alone in thinking that.', 'In their open letter to the Disney Board, Mr. Peltz’s current and former colleagues wrote that:', '“the companies for which we served as board members alongside Nelson were improved because of his presence on the board.”11', 'Jim Cramer on CNBC confirmed this sentiment among the executives with whom Mr. Peltz has worked:', '“I interviewed the CEOs of Procter & Gamble, the CEO of Mondelēz and the CEO of Heinz, and Nelson Peltz was on [the] board of all those and all those CEOs said that he did an amazing job asking questions and stopping them from doing stupid things.”12', 'This sentiment was affirmed, independently, by James Stewart of The New York Times, who interviewed “dozens of former executives at companies targeted by Mr. Peltz”13 and found that “all said he had bolstered results…”14', 'Commentators familiar with Jay Rasulo’s track record have similarly touted his valuable experience. Robbie Whelan of The Wall Street Journal noted that Mr. Rasulo grew “intimately familiar with Disney over the course of his nearly 30-year tenure,”15 and Bob Iger himself has referred to Mr. Rasulo as a “valued colleague and friend, as well as a vital contributor to Disney’s success”16 and commended him for his “strategic acumen and savvy insight.”17', 'Shareholders Should Vote FOR Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo ', 'We are pleased that our campaign has garnered support from accomplished independent commentators and research firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the largest and most influential proxy advisory firm, which wrote that:', '“[Nelson] Peltz, as a significant shareholder, could be additive to [Disney’s] succession process, providing assurance to other investors that the board is properly engaged this time around. He could also help evaluate future capital allocation decisions.”18', 'Like ISS, we believe that Disney’s Board needs a “catalyst”19 to improve its effectiveness – directors who will bring new perspectives, ask tough questions and encourage open-minded debate.', 'Ultimately, the question for shareholders as they cast their vote is: given the company’s record of underperformance, which directors can best ensure a brighter future for Disney and its shareholders? Who can best exercise independent judgment on behalf of shareholders to ensure Disney is on the right strategic path, executing well and with a compensation plan that aligns management’s incentives with the creation of shareholder value?', 'We do not believe that the current Board, which has presided over deteriorating performance and a failed succession, can address Disney’s challenges. To improve the focus, alignment and accountability of the Board, we believe Disney needs new, independent directors.', 'Our nominees, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, are dedicated to ensuring a better future for this iconic company. Help us elect Mr. Peltz and Mr. Rasulo, and together, we can Restore the Magic at Disney.', 'To ensure the election of Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, it is essential that shareholders vote “FOR” Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, and “WITHHOLD” on Michael B.G. Froman, Maria Elena Lagomasino, and all three Blackwells Nominees. As Disney’s annual meeting is less than two weeks away, it is important that shareholders vote TODAY. Every vote is important.

We urge our fellow Disney shareholders to carefully read these materials to best inform your voting decisions.', 'Walt Disney once said, “Times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the future.”1', 'Indeed, this is probably the most important point of the contest for the election of the Board. The Board needs directors who are independent and who will guide management into the future and contribute relevant skills and experience.', 'The case for change is clear. Blackwells and its three nominees have identified certain governance failings at Disney that they believe can be corrected by adding to the Board the talents and capabilities that Blackwells’ nominees offer. Most of the current Board has presided over substantial dollar market value declines.2 Certainly, extraneous events like the global pandemic had an impact, however, in our view, Disney’s content and technology strategies are weak and its lack of transparency is stark—and the Board lacks real proficiency in these fields.', 'Shareholders, particularly those who espouse the principals of good corporate governance and believe there is a need for change at Disney, do not have to accept the false dichotomy of Mr. Peltz or the status quo Board. The Board does not need nominees driven by personal grievances or animus towards management, as we believe Trian Partners’ (“Trian”) nominees Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo are.', 'In our view, Mr. Peltz not only lacks critical expertise, but appears to boast about his shortcomings. Mr. Peltz may be one of America’s most vocal investors, but he is also viewed as the “most overrated.”3 Fifteen out of twenty-two companies where Trian has taken a board seat, have underperformed the S&P 500 during Trian’s tenure on the board.4', 'Moreover, where Trian has outperformed the market, it has arguably been the result of management resisting or ignoring Trian’s ideas. At Proctor & Gamble, its management rejected Mr. Peltz’s main thesis to move its Cincinnati headquarters “just for disruption” and to decentralize M&A to its business units.5 At PepsiCo, its management rejected Mr. Peltz’s thesis to divest North American and International beverages, dispose of Frito Lay, and merge Pepsi’s high-performing products with Mondelez – where Mr. Peltz also had a stake – hardly moves that would have been in the best interest of shareholders (other than Mr. Peltz, perhaps).6', 'It is no surprise, then, that Trian faced a spate of investor redemptions due to poor performance, shuttering its U.K. fund, and overseeing a collapse of almost 40% of its assets under management.7 Key personnel have departed from Trian, including Mr. Peltz’s own son-in-law Ed Garden, which is due in part to Trian’s poor performance.8', 'Recently, Mr. Peltz has made a series of disturbing public statements that Blackwells believes are an affront to Disney’s customers, employees and shareholders, and ultimately should disqualify him from sitting on the Disney Board. Some of the views Mr. Peltz shared with the press include:9', '“What sense is being a billionaire if you’re not a bully?”', '“Why do I need an all-Black cast?” [Referring to box office hit – Black Panther]', '“Why do I have to have a Marvel [movie] that’s all women?” [Referring to The Marvels]', '“I told Unilever not to pull out [of Russia] and so far they’ve listened,” says Peltz. “If we pull out of Russia, they will take our brands for themselves. I don’t think that’s a good trade.”', 'Fellow Shareholders, this is not the type of individual who belongs in Disney’s boardroom.', 'Blackwells’ Nominees Are the Clear Choice for The Future of Disney', 'In its recommendations, Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. concluded that change is warranted at Disney, and we agree.10 Blackwells’ nominees offer solutions drawn from real-life experiences to address Disney’s issues and fill critical gaps on the Board. Blackwells’ proposal—to add back any incumbent Disney director who loses the election to a non-Disney director—will also ensure that the necessary change is made in a collaborative and efficient manner.', 'Craig Hatkoff has 47 years as an independent director on public company boards. He is a turnaround, risk-management, and financial expert with authority on governance best practices, strategic alternatives, and succession planning. Mr. Hatkoff also benefits from deep media industry knowledge. For the last 13 years, Mr. Hatkoff has been an independent director of SL Green Realty Corp., Manhattan’s largest office landlord.', 'Jessica Schell has unparalleled experience in media and entertainment. She is at the forefront of the content distribution paradigm, an industry expert in content value optimization, and would be a valuable addition to the Board. Ms. Schell spent 20 years in strategic and operating roles at three major entertainment companies – Warner Bros., NBC Universal, and Disney.', 'Leah Solivan has built her career on imagining and creating technology. She is precisely the candidate that this Board needs to continue to imagine the future AR/VR and AI trends at Disney. Ms. Solivan is deeply immersed in the latest technology as a General Partner at Fuel Capital. There, she is surrounded by cutting-edge AR/VR and spatial computing technologies, and the founders that are making it all possible. Before Fuel Capital, Ms. Solivan created TaskRabbit, Inc. (“TaskRabbit”), a pioneering on-demand marketplace company she founded in 2008. As TaskRabbit’s CEO for eight years, she scaled the company into an international business with operations in 44 cities, prior to overseeing TaskRabbit’s sale to IKEA.', 'To learn more about our plans to remedy these issues, we encourage shareholders to visit www.TheFutureOfDisney.com.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Undervalued Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.', 'At the end of last year, when the Federal Reserve made optimistic comments on the state of the US economy and Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the Fed had managed to make good progress towards reaching its 2% inflation goal, the US equity markets entered into what many began to call an ""everything rally."" According to a Factor Performance Analysis report published by Confluence Technologies this January, this rally favored growth and volatility in the equity markets, as opposed to value and yield. As a result, growth and volatility significantly outperformed value and yield in both the fourth quarter and generally in 2023 as well.', 'Today, stocks in the semiconductors, cloud computing, and biotechnology sectors are making up a significant chunk of growth stocks. These sectors are some of the best performers in the market so far this year, making them attractive investments for a long time to come. Growth stocks are typically those that have a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, robust earnings growth, strong quarterly guidance and the capability to exceed this guidance, and immense volatility. Considering these factors brought together, especially the volatility factor, it can be said that with growth stocks, you either win big or lose quickly, depending on the state of the economy and the probability of a recession hitting the markets.', 'Despite the volatility associated with growth stocks, many investors consider them to be attractive investments, and for good reason. As noted by Brandywine Global in its Quantitative Review of US Equities for the fourth quarter of 2023, growth stocks, particularly in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, significantly outperformed their value counterparts in the Russell 1000 Value Index. At the end of 2023, the growth index had raked in returns of 42.7%, whereas the value index lagged much further behind with its 11.5% gain.', 'The review noted a factor of interest. Over the past year, growth stocks performed better than value when long-term interest rates declined, but the opposite was true when long-term interest rates were on the rise. Resultantly, when interest rates began to fall in the fourth quarter of 2023, growth stocks found themselves as the best performers in the market. Although initially, the growth rally was spearheaded predominantly by large or mega-cap tech stocks, later in 2023 and even now in 2024, the focus shifted from a select few tech names to include stocks in our market capitalization brackets and sectors as well.

Every new computer and mobile device will soon be fitted with AI processors, which will speed up response times and improve the user experience. The chipsets inside next-generation computers are called neural processing units (NPUs) and are specifically designed to handle AI workloads. They require up to 80% more DRAM content than today's average PC chips, and that translates to more revenue for Micron."", ""In the mobile space, Micron expects AI-enabled smartphones to carry up to double the DRAM content compared to traditional models. Micron's AI chips can be found in Samsung's new Galaxy S24 device, which comes with a host of AI features. One of them is Live Translate, which allows two people to speak over the phone in different languages, and another is Circle to Search, which recognizes objects in photos and allows the user to instantly run an online search."", ""On-device processing is the industry's next frontier, because it will take AI out of the data center and insert it into everyday life. Demand is already soaring; Advanced Micro Devices is a leader in AI CPU and NPU technologies, and it has shipped millions of AI-enabled computers to date."", ""Micron's revenue plunged by 50% during fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31, 2023), dragging the company's bottom line to a net loss of $5.8 billion for the year. Pandemic-related supply shortages caused the chip industry to overproduce, leading to an inventory glut and plummeting prices."", ""Micron has now emerged from that period. The company's revenue returned to growth in the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), although it still lost more than $1.2 billion at the bottom line. But the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) was a true breakout period for the company."", ""Micron delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, which was a whopping 57% year-over-year increase, and it also crushed the company's forecast of $5.3 billion. Plus, it generated a net income of $793 million, which marked a welcome return to profitability."", 'CEO Sanjay Mehrotra attributed the strong quarter to a tightening supply demand balance, which had a positive impact on prices across all end markets. However, he also gave a nod to the strength in AI server (data center) demand.', 'Micron is forecasting $6.6 billion in revenue for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), which would represent an increase of 76% compared to the year-ago period. That would be a powerful growth acceleration from the second quarter.', ""Since Micron was losing money up until Q2, investors can't use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value its stock. However, based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $18.3 billion and its current market capitalization of $122 billion, Micron stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7."", ""That's extremely cheap compared to Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 37, and even Advanced Micro Devices stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.9. Those names deserve a premium because their work in the GPU, CPU, and NPU spaces is unprecedented, and they effectively create demand for Micron's products."", ""However, AI is expected to add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy over the next 10 years, and Micron's hardware is a key component to unlocking that value creation. The company is ramping up the pace of innovation; it's now sampling its 12-high HBM3E data center product, which increases DRAM capacity by 50%. That means companies like Nvidia can pack more memory into each GPU, which leads to faster training and inferencing, paving the way for more advanced AI models."", ""With Micron's revenue growth clearly accelerating, the all-time high in its stock shouldn't deter investors from buying it -- especially considering its valuation and the substantial opportunity that lies ahead."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Let's find out more about them."", 'Micron is a leading supplier of memory and solid-state storage solutions and is seeing a strong rebound in revenue and earnings. Investors anticipate a recovery, which helped push the stock up 91% over the last year. But the stock still trades at a low forward P/E that undervalues the tremendous demand starting to come from AI servers.', 'Micron reported a revenue increase of 57% year over year and an increase of 23% over the previous quarter. The company supplies products for smartphones and PCs, but the demand coming from artificial intelligence (AI) servers is coming in stronger than expected.', ""A key factor in analyzing Micron's business is the supply and demand for memory products, which are susceptible to price swings that can impact revenue and profitability. On that note, the demand from AI servers is causing a ripple across the memory market that is tightening supply and pushing up prices. As a result, Micron turned a year-ago loss into a profit last quarter."", 'Micron sees the overall demand for servers getting stronger in the second half of calendar 2024. This means Micron is positioned for a full year of data center growth in 2025.', ""While the stock is hitting new highs, it still trades at a low forward P/E ratio of 7 based on Wall Street's earnings estimates this year. Keep in mind, Micron has historically traded at a low P/E due to the cyclical nature of its business, but it is clearly going to be a beneficiary of the AI spending increase by data centers over the next year. The upswing in demand that is underway spells more upside."", ""A slow economy in China has weighed on shares of leading internet companies. Tencent is no exception. Sluggish revenue growth has sent the stock tumbling well off its previous peak, but this is an incredibly profitable business with leading positions in video games and entertainment offerings. It won't stay down long."", 'Tencent is already turning the corner. Total revenue grew 7% year over year in the last quarter. While revenues from its social networks and games were slightly down, double-digit growth from online advertising and fintech services was responsible for the year-over-year revenue increase.', ""Importantly, Tencent's operating profit soared 35% year over year.

Its $24 billion in free cash flow reflects not only a lucrative strategy but also how popular its games and entertainment offerings are in China. Its WeChat app reaches over 1.3 billion monthly active users.', 'The shares trade at a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 16.7 -- a bargain for a leading tech and entertainment company. Management seems to believe so, too.

However, Micron is back in all-out growth mode, and it just turned a GAAP profit again in its last reported quarter (Q2 fiscal 2024, the three months ended in February 2024). Credit goes to a return of normal PC and smartphone purchasing, but another key factor is Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) generative artificial intelligence (AI) revolution."", ""Micron's return to profitability has big implications for its stock (as well as for memory chip manufacturing equipment and service providers like Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX)). But it also has potentially monumental implications for Nvidia and the already white-hot generative AI infrastructure boom. Here's what investors need to know."", 'As for high-level stuff, Micron reported a 58% year-over-year increase in sales last quarter to $5.82 billion. Its rapid return back to its last peak sales cycle, which occurred in 2022 at the end of the pandemic-induced chip shortage, will continue in fiscal Q3 2024 (which ends in May). Management is predicting revenue of $6.6 billion at the midpoint of guidance, which would equal a 76% year-over-year jump.', 'That growth is impressive, but note that Micron is still lapping its horribly depressed financial results from the depths of the bear market a year ago.', ""This is all nevertheless fantastic news for Micron, which finally reported a GAAP net profit again of $793 million (or $476 million on an adjusted basis). The company has a lot to gain as it keeps ramping up manufacturing of HBM3e, the latest iteration of third-generation high-bandwidth memory. HBM3e is used in accelerated computing and AI -- like Nvidia's new systems just announced at its annual GTC event last week."", 'The market has been going wild over a business that up until just this quarter has been operating deep in the red. But investors were vindicated by this quote from Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra: ""We are on track to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024 and expect HBM revenues to be accretive to our DRAM and overall gross margins starting in the fiscal third quarter. Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024, and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.""', 'In other words, it looks like the good times will keep rolling for at least another year, if not longer.', ""All eyes have been on Nvidia's historic run, with its shares up well over 500% since the start of 2023. Even after this melt-up, though, the stock trades for 37 times Wall Street analysts' current-year expectations for earnings per share."", ""Underpinning this expectation is that Nvidia earnings will double from last year. Just as Micron expects AI computing growth to continue almost unabated through 2025, so do Nvidia investors. The fact that Micron's HBM manufacturing capacity is almost completely booked out through 2025 is a solid indication of Nvidia's demand for more high-end memory chips."", ""However, and this is the $2.3 trillion question (really, that's Nvidia's approximate market cap as of this writing), Nvidia's demand for these HBM chips will depend on its customers continuing to gobble up as many accelerated compute systems it can crank out with partners like Micron."", ""But the semiconductor manufacturing space is highly collaborative. It costs a great deal of money to design, build, and sell these systems. Nvidia isn't likely to be booking big orders from Micron if it wasn't getting advance orders from its big tech data center customers."", 'To be sure, this party will come to an end someday.

If you want to skip our coverage of the data center industry, which is one of the hottest in the world right now, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. ', 'The stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were expecting at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. Back then, the Federal Reserve had yet to start to raise interest rates, even though some voices on Wall Street were raising alarm bells about the effects of the monetary policy and stimulus packages in the era of COVID-19 lock downs. High rates naturally do not bode well for high growth sectors, and technology stocks big and small had a rough time on the market the next year particularly as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global food and energy markets and spurred multi year high inflation levels which made some question whether consecutive 75 basis point hikes by the Federal Reserve were still a bit low.', 'Now, with the first quarter of 2024 coming to an end, the stock market is a fundamentally changed environment due to the rise of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA has shown to be the hottest artificial intelligence stock on Wall Street, and at its heart is the multi-billion global data center industry. While most people experience the user side of AI, at its heart, the technology is part of a broader set of data analysis techniques such as machine learning.', ""Whether it's AI or ML, both require copious amounts of data to spearhead leading edge applications in high technology industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Processing and storing this data requires considerable data center facilities, which are large scale computing houses that 'host' equipment such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage modules."", 'A variety of firms cater to the needs of the global data center industry. Some of the best known in this area are data center hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). On the software side, firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide businesses with software environments to generate meaningful insights from their data.', ""Therefore, to analyze the performance of data center stocks, one can either see how individual firms such as the equities listed above are performing or track a collection of stocks called an exchange traded fund (ETF). Most popular data center ETFs also include real estate investment trusts (ETFs) due to the sizeable real estate requirements of operating and owning data centers. One such ETF is the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Its six month, 12 month, and 36 month year returns sit at 14.5%, 22.27%, and 2.10%, respectively. As expected, the ETF's annual returns in 2022 were negative, as the broader technology sector took a beating."", ""Finally, one stock that helps keep track of the broader data center industry might be faring is Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR). Here's what Baron Funds had to say about this particular stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", 'Following strong share performance, we trimmed our large investment in data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for the company.', 'Data center landlords such as Digital Realty (and Equinix, Inc.) are benefiting from record low vacancy, demand outpacing supply, more constrained power availability, and rising rental rates. Several secular demand vectors, which are currently broadening, are contributing to robust fundamentals for data center space globally. They include the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, increased cloud computing adoption, the ongoing growth in mobile data and internet traffic, and artificial intelligence as a new wave of data center demand.', 'In the last few months, we have also spent time with CEO Andy Power of Digital Realty. Over the last few years, Andy and Digital Realty’s management team have been undergoing a business transformation, which accelerated after its acquisition of Interxion in March 2020, a pure-play European network-dense data center operator. The company has been shedding non-core slower-growth assets, investing and expanding in Europe, growing its retail colocation business, improving its balance sheet, and adding operational expertise by supplementing new management leadership. We have spent a significant amount of time with Andy over the years and believe the investments the company has made are on the cusp of bearing fruit and will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, we believe the fundamentals in its core business are at an inflection point with robust demand/bookings, pricing power, hyperscale cloud players outsourcing a higher percentage of their digital infrastructure needs and limited competitive capacity. We believe these factors will lead to growth in the core business in the next few years and are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some undervalued and best data center stocks according to analysts.

The makes sense given that the stock recently achieved a new all-time high of over $3,000 a share (before slipping back slightly).', ""Here's why Chipotle and two other leading restaurant, food, and beverage dividend stocks are all worth buying now."", ""Chipotle has growth -- plain and simple. Its top line continues to grow at a breakneck pace, but it's the company's margins that have really improved in recent years. Chipotle now has roughly the same operating margin as Starbucks but is growing at a far faster rate."", ""However, unlike other restaurant chains, Chipotle doesn't pay a dividend because it prefers to pour profits back into the business. This bold strategy can amplify gains, but it also puts pressure on the investment thesis when there's a slowdown."", ""What's more, Chipotle is a very expensive stock -- especially for its size and industry. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 66. Granted, the forward P/E is a bit lower at about 55."", ""Analysts' consensus estimates call for $64.78 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share (pre-split) -- which would imply 21% growth compared to fiscal 2024 expectations of $53.45 per share."", ""If Chipotle keeps growing its bottom line by 15% to 20% per year, then its expensive valuation could start to look much more reasonable over time. But there's no denying the stock is priced to perfection and should only be considered by investors who believe in the company's sustained growth and have a multi-year outlook."", ""Chipotle isn't a terrible buy, but McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) could be even better. For one, investors are getting the chance to buy McDonald's at a 24.5 P/E, a discount to its five-year median P/E of 27.1."", ""McDonald's has been raising its dividend at a fairly rapid rate. The current quarterly dividend is $1.67 --\xa0 roughly double what it was 10 years ago. In October, McDonald's raised its dividend by 10%, which is a sizable increase for a company of its size. The raise puts McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King by 2026."", ""McDonald's has an underrated business model. Unlike Chipotle, which owns and operates all its U.S. locations, 95% of McDonald's locations worldwide are franchised. McDonald's owns the real estate and collects rent revenue, royalties, franchise fees, and more. The company's structure makes its brand and the perceived revenue that franchisees can generate over time more important than its short-term performance or even the business cycle."", ""McDonald's may not have Chipotle's growth, but it's a better investment if you're looking for consistency. The company has an extensive track record of rewarding its shareholders. As mentioned, the dividend has roughly doubled over the last decade, but it's the entire capital return program that really stands out."", ""Over the last decade, McDonald's has bought back over a quarter of its outstanding shares, which illustrates the effectiveness of its business model and how it rewards shareholders using dividends and buybacks on top of potential capital gains."", ""In sum, McDonald's has it all, and is worth buying now."", ""Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) hasn't bought back shares at nearly the rate as McDonald's. And it doesn't have as good growth prospects as Chipotle or McDonald's. However, what Coke has is stability and the ever-important quality of not overextending itself."", ""Coke was instrumental in globalizing soda. But today, the company is mature. There's only so much it can do to grow without overspending. To its credit, it has made measured and mostly effective acquisitions. It has also stayed almost entirely within its core competency of nonalcoholic beverages, which is far different from a company like PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, and plenty of other brands across product categories."", 'When the market has a bad year, Coke tends to outperform. But when the market has a great year, Coke usually underperforms. Unsurprisingly, Coke has underperformed because the market has done very well in recent years.', ""The ideal way to invest in Coke isn't because you're trying to beat the market, but because you want to limit downside risk and collect passive income. Nothing is guaranteed in the stock market, but Coke is about as close as it gets to predictability. The company has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years."", ""The stock yields 3.2% -- which is quite a bit higher than other reliable Dividend Kings. Coke's reliability is one of the reasons why Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway has owned the stock for over 30 years."", ""It's easy to get enamored with a growth story like Chipotle, especially when the entry point (without fractional shares) becomes lower, thanks to a stock split. However, to have the conviction to hold a stock over time, it's essential to invest in companies you understand and that align with your investment objectives."", ""Chipotle's lack of a dividend and its lofty valuation won't appeal to everyone. If you're more income and value oriented, McDonald's and Coke could be better choices."", ""But if you're a balanced investor, then picking up shares of all three stocks is a great way to get a bit of growth, value, and income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

But at a compelling forward P/E multiple of 18.1, investors might still be interested in scooping up shares to hold for the long term.', ""If this sounds like you, it's worth taking the time to figure out where American Express will be in five years."", 'Inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and recessionary fears are worrying investors these days. But this business continues to put up solid numbers.', 'Just in the last quarter, revenue (net of interest expense) and diluted earnings per share increased 11% and 27%, respectively, year over year. During the three-month period, Amex added 2.9 million net new card accounts.', 'Executives believe the momentum will continue throughout 2024, as they expect double-digit revenue and earnings gains this year. If a recession did happen, it could certainly have a negative impact on the business. But American Express has successfully navigated economic downturns before. And this should give investors confidence. ', ""Trying to accurately predict the future is a virtually impossible task. No one knows what the world will look like five years from now. This reality can make investing difficult for those who allocate capital behind constantly changing technology-focused industries. It's hard to know how things will play out."", ""Luckily, this isn't an issue with American Express. It operates in the boring and slow-moving card payment arena. In fact, the business has been around for over 170 years, showcasing its longevity and ability to navigate the changing times successfully."", ""If we set our sights on 2029, I believe there's a very high likelihood that American Express will be doing the exact same things it does now. That primarily includes bringing on new card members and signing up new merchants. In other words, the company is simply in replication mode, continuing to do what it knows best and what has worked in the past."", 'But of course, there are some trends that investors should be mindful of. American Express is attracting younger customers at a rapid pace. In 2023, 60% of new consumer card members were millennials or Gen-Z consumers.', 'Management is also focused on better serving its customer base. This includes inking new deals. ""We have a large and growing partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to card members and merchant partners around the world,"" said CEO Steve Squeri on the Q4 2023 earnings call.', ""Shares of Amex climbed 108% in the past five years. And I'm sure some bullish investors are hoping for a repeat performance over the next five years. That gain might just outperform the S&P 500."", ""One of the most important factors that drives a stock's performance is the bottom line. With this in mind, it's easy to be optimistic. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amex's EPS is set to rise at an annualized pace of nearly 15% between 2023 and 2026. Should it keep that rate up even further out, while the valuation multiple stays the same, doubling the stock price is the likely outcome."", ""I like to keep expectations a bit more tempered, though. Given how much the stock has rallied recently, as well as the fact that its valuation isn't exactly a screaming bargain right now, I have less confidence that it can double again over the next five years. This is a mature and stable enterprise that might not be able to register that kind of gain."", ""However, don't let that outlook discourage you.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Women in the Workforce.\xa0', ""Women play a crucial role in the global labor market, yet disparities persist across various dimensions. The Global Gender Gap Report 2023 revealed concerning trends as women continue to face disproportionate challenges in employment and leadership positions. Between 2019 and 2020, women's labor-force participation declined by 3.4%, compared to 2.4% for men. While there has been a modest recovery since then, with parity in participation increasing from 63% to 64% between 2022 and 2023, major gaps remain. These gaps are particularly pronounced in regions like the Middle East and North Africa, where labor-force participation for women stands at only 30%."", 'Unemployment rates also reflect gender disparities, with women consistently facing higher rates than men, except during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. The International Labour Organization estimates the global unemployment rate at approximately 4.5% for women and 4.3% for men. Furthermore, women encounter greater challenges in their job searches and are less readily available to start work on short notice, contributing to higher rates of unemployment. To read more about unemployment, see the European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.', 'Representation in senior leadership positions remains skewed, with women comprising only 32.2% of senior leadership roles globally in 2023, despite constituting 41.9% of the overall workforce. Industries such as Healthcare and Care Services show higher levels of gender diversity in leadership, while others, like Manufacturing and Infrastructure, lag behind significantly. Moreover, the ""drop to the top"" phenomenon illustrates how female representation declines as seniority level increases, highlighting persistent barriers to advancement for women in the workforce.', ""However, it is also worth highlighting that the landscape of women in the workforce is evolving, driven by increasing ambition and the growing importance of workplace flexibility. While women's representation in C-suite positions has reached its highest point, there remains a major gap in the middle of the pipeline, particularly for women of color. According to the report, women represent roughly one in four C-suite leaders, and women of color just one in 16."", 'One of the key challenges identified is the ""broken rung"" phenomenon, which presents a huge obstacle for women\'s advancement, particularly at the manager level. According to the report, in 2023, for every 100 men promoted from entry level to manager, only 87 women were promoted. This disparity disproportionately affects women of color, exacerbating existing inequalities in the corporate pipeline. Additionally, the report sheds light on the pervasive impact of microaggressions on women\'s careers and well-being, emphasizing the need for organizations to create psychologically safe environments.', ""Despite these challenges, there is growing recognition of the value of workplace flexibility for both men and women. According to the report, roughly 80% of women want to be promoted to the next level, compared with 70 percent in 2019. Moreover, the pandemic and increased flexibility did not dampen women's ambitions, as approximately one in five women say flexibility like remote work has helped them stay in their job or avoid reducing their hours.

(NYSE:BEP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“Brookfield Corporation has $9.2 billion invested through Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP), a publicly traded permanent capital vehicle that invests in renewable power and decarbonization solutions. The partnership is Brookfield’s longest standing listed investment vehicle and over the past two decades has assembled one of the world’s largest portfolios of hydroelectric, wind, solar, and renewable storage assets. The origins of Brookfield Renewable trace back to the Great Lakes Hydro Income Fund, which owned three hydroelectric generating stations located along the Lievre River that produced an annual average of 1,400 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity. Following its listing, Great Lakes Hydro under the leadership of Richard Legault acquired and developed an additional thirty-nine hydroelectric generating stations from 1999 to 2010, adding more than 4,000 GWh of annual electricity production. Meanwhile, because Great Lakes Hydro was a controlled subsidiary of Brookfield, Richard Legault, alongside other executives at Brookfield, spearheaded efforts to assemble an extensive portfolio of hydroelectric power assets that were owned by Brookfield directly. By 2010, Brookfield Renewable Power Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield, had acquired 128 hydroelectric generating stations that it owned in addition to the assets owned via Great Lakes Hydro. Shortly thereafter, in 2011, Brookfield opted to consolidate all its renewable power assets into one investment vehicle under what was already a unified management structure, which formed Brookfield Renewable Partners. The new entity owned and operated 170 hydroelectric generating stations in North America and Brazil that produced 15,200 GWh of annual electricity, or more than a 10x increase since inception. In addition, the partnership inherited three wind facilities, two natural gas fired power plants, and a substantial 5,000 GWh development pipeline of renewable power projects. Notably, in contrast to more recently established renewable energy platforms, Brookfield Renewable Partners remained almost entirely hydroelectric power focused until 2011, and its cash flows remained over seventy percent hydro-centric until 2020. This resulted from Brookfield’s strong value orientation and aversion to projects that relied heavily on subsidy markets. Today, Brookfield Renewable Partners owns and operates 229 hydroelectric power facilities that produce an annual average of 20,000 GWh of electricity. These hydro assets remain the bedrock of the current portfolio and account for approximately half of the partnership’s $1.4 billion in asset-level cash flows. What’s more, quality of cash flows varies greatly across the renewables sector. Hydro assets achieve the highest relative capacity factors, offer natural energy storage solutions in the form of reservoirs, and, in contrast to solar and wind assets that have a useful life of twenty-five years, are perpetual in nature. For example, the original Lievre River assets that were contributed to the Great Lakes Hydro Income Fund were constructed between 1929 and 1954. In 2022, Brookfield Renewable Partners signed a new forty year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the government of Quebec to offtake the power from these exact assets. In other words, by the end of this term the oldest of these generating stations will have been revenue producing for more than 130 years. As a result, the capital required to sustain production from hydro is seven times less than that of wind and solar, resulting in a free cash flow conversion that is nearly fifty percent greater. Nevertheless, as hydroelectric assets have become increasingly scarce and as the economics of other renewable technologies have improved in recent years, Brookfield Renewable Partners has been rapidly scaling its solar and wind portfolio. At present, the partnership owns 131 wind facilities, 156 utility scale solar facilities, and more than 6,000 distributed generation facilities, often in the form of commercial and industrial solar or community solar installations…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Denison Mines Corp.

How each case is handled\xa0varies by state courts and law.', ""In a New Jersey Superior Court, for example, Judge Haekyoung Suh recently ordered United's OptumRx to halt the termination of a pharmacy until it completed arbitration."", '""Optum is given great authority regarding termination,"" Suh wrote in her opinion in December, regarding the contract between the PBM and pharmacy.', ""The three largest healthcare companies in the country have a combined market value of more than $640 billion — all of which have their own mail-order prescription service. This has caused the misaligned incentives FTC's Khan referenced, where a PBM is looking for ways to have to pay out less to the pharmacies and direct patients to mail orders."", 'Swichar said the contracts are increasingly unfavorable to pharmacies. Other lawyers are also starting to see the trend.', 'One lawyer, who declined to be quoted in order to protect his clients in ongoing legal cases with PBMs, represents independent pharmacies for a broad array of legal issues. He shared with Yahoo Finance on background that he expects to see one or two termination notices a year. But in 2023, he saw more than half a dozen termination notices, which rose to surpass one dozen in the first quarter of 2024 alone.', ""Pharmacies are audited by PBMs in order to ensure the pharmacy is only getting paid for drugs it actually dispenses and that it isn't overcharging the PBMs and insurers.

In one instance, a pharmacy missed an email from the PBM, prompting the termination notice."", ""When a pharmacy is audited and given a termination notice, it races to thwart the PBM's efforts to shut it down within 60 to 90 days by correcting or defending against the issues cited. There is an appeal process, which usually involves an internal hearing comprised of PBM staff, followed by potential arbitration for further appeal."", 'But amid the rise in termination notices, those avenues for recourse are becoming less meaningful.', 'In a recent email viewed by Yahoo Finance, lawyers who represent independent pharmacies were notified that the internal appeal hearings at Optum are being discontinued. Instead, a panel will review the appeal documentation and simply provide a written decision.', ""PBMs are making matters worse by sending notices to patients that their pharmacies are out of network well before the deadline to rectify the issue — at day 45 out of the 90-day period, for example. This drives patients directly to the PBMs' mail-order services."", ""And there is no law requiring the PBMs to notify patients once the pharmacy resolves the issues, so pharmacies forever lose those customers, NCPA's Pivarunas\xa0explained. The damage is done."", 'In Suh\'s decision in December, she said the PBM had already pushed the pharmacy\'s termination date, showing that ""no immediate harm will result"" in continuing operations. In fact, she said, the pharmacy had demonstrated that termination ""will result in serious harm through loss of customers, disrupted operations, and potential termination of partnerships with physician providers.""', 'That\'s why, Swichar said, ""losing network rights with any one of them will, with almost certainty, put the pharmacy out of business.""', ""Cigna's Express Scripts has previously said that, as of 2022, 35% of its pharmacy network was independent pharmacies, while retail chains accounted for 33% and grocery chains were 32%.

While both companies are beating peers in this regard, Walmart stands out as having higher-quality demand trends. The retailer posted a 4% sales uptick in the most recent quarter that was mainly driven by rising customer traffic. Shoppers are responding well to its price-leadership selling approach as they look to cut costs. Rival Target, in contrast, has been posting declining customer traffic for more than a year.', 'Procter & Gamble is growing at about the same 4% rate, but those gains are being driven entirely by rising prices. Volume fell 1% last quarter, suggesting consumers are deciding to scale back on purchases of products like Tide detergent and Bounty paper towels in response to higher prices.', 'Walmart is also demonstrating that it can grow in areas outside of its core retailing focus. The company crossed $100 billion of e-commerce sales after that segment expanded 23% last year. Investors are excited about rising digital advertising spending, too. Despite its maturity, Walmart is the better option for growth-focused income investors.', ""P&G does pay a more generous dividend right now, partly thanks to the stock's relatively weak performance over the past year.

P&G won't reveal its annual raise until mid-April, but investors can expect something similar to last year's 3% boost."", ""It's too early to tell whether Walmart's dividend will keep growing at a faster pace from here, and that's why income investors might prefer Procter & Gamble for its higher yield and its stronger profit margin (23% compared to Walmart's 4%)."", ""P&G is easily the more expensive stock, but for some good reasons. These include its strong profit margin that sits north of 20% of sales, along with its ample cash flow. These factors allowed it to return $16 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends last year. Walmart's capital returns were closer to $9 billion."", ""It's worth keeping Walmart on your watch list, though, to look for signs that the company is making a meaningful move toward higher profit margins as it pushes deeper into tech growth niches like digital advertising.

Elements such as varying interest rates and persistent concerns regarding inflation consistently drive investors to reserve a portion of their funds. In this regard, dividend stocks emerge as an optimal choice, providing shareholders with consistent income distributions on a quarterly or monthly basis. Moreover, according to Hartford Funds, dividends have yielded robust returns for shareholders over the last 92 years, surpassing the performance of the overall market. The report highlighted that between 1940 and 2023, dividend income accounted for an average of 34% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index.', 'Investors consistently harbor concerns regarding how inflation might affect their investment choices. Fortunately, dividend stocks have shown resilience against inflationary pressures over the years, often surpassing inflationary trends instead of being significantly impacted by them. Historical analysis indicates that dividend stocks have proven to be among the top-performing investment options during inflationary periods. According to a report by Wisdom Tree, dividends exhibited an average annual growth rate of 5.7% from 1957 to 2022, surpassing the 3.68% average growth rate of inflation over the same period. Similarly, for the period between 1990 and 2022, dividends demonstrated an average growth rate of 5.6%, significantly outpacing the 2.64% growth rate of inflation during this time span.', 'Engaging in dividend stock investment requires a meticulous strategy for managing returns. Investors typically undertake a thorough analysis that includes comparing dividend levels with stock prices to make informed decisions. By carrying out these comparisons, investors can assess the relative attractiveness of dividend-paying stocks based on their yield and potential for capital appreciation. Several reports have also conducted comparisons between the performance of dividend stocks and that of stock prices and showed the superior performance of dividend equities. Wisdom Tree reported that over the past 64 years, there have been merely six instances where dividend levels experienced a decline, and only one of those occasions saw a decrease exceeding 5%. In stark contrast, throughout the same period, stock prices encountered declines in 18 years, with the most severe annual decline exceeding 40% and an average decline surpassing 11%. This means that stock prices exhibited more than twice the volatility compared to the underlying dividend cash flows during this period.', 'When considering investments in dividend stocks, low-priced equities have their own appeal. One of the main reasons for this is that dividend stocks with low prices may have greater potential for capital appreciation, as they have more room to grow compared to higher-priced stocks. In addition to this, if the company behind the low-priced dividend stock increases its dividends over time, investors could benefit from both increased income and potential capital gains. However, conducting thorough research on the company’s financial health and balance sheet is crucial when making such investment decisions.

The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of 36% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Eaton’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Eaton ', ""Eaton appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Eaton’s ratio of 39.34x is above its peer average of 22x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Electrical industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Eaton’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Eaton's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 40%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ETN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ETN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ETN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024.\xa0', ""The real estate investment trust (REIT) in the US is an important component of the real estate market and the broader financial landscape. The sector has experienced substantial growth over the years. As per Ernst & Young's findings, publicly traded REITs have witnessed a remarkable compound annual growth rate of around 16.8% from the close of 1990. During this period, their collective equity market capitalization surged from $9 billion to nearly $1.27 trillion by the end of 2022. In addition to this, REITs in the US oversee a total of $4.5 trillion worth of real estate assets globally as of September 2023, according to CNBC."", ""The contribution of the REIT sector to the US economy stands unmatched. Through its diverse activities including operations, dividend income, interest payments, and construction projects, the sector has played a significant role in fostering economic growth. In particular, these activities have contributed a substantial $262.9 billion in labor income to the economy in 2022. Following a lackluster performance in 2022, the past year showed some improvement for the REIT sector, with positive returns recorded. The index tracks the performance of publicly traded REITs headquartered in the US. While the sector didn't outperform the broader market, the S&P United States REIT Index managed to achieve a total return of 13.77% over the year. That said, the REIT stocks experienced a significant surge, surpassing the performance of the overall market during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index concluded the quarter with an impressive total return of 17.9%, whereas the S&P 500 recorded a return of 11.7% for the same period."", ""In addition to delivering strong returns, the REIT sector also experienced notable growth in capital market activity last year, marking a significant uptick from 2022. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the industry successfully raised a total of $58.27 billion, reflecting a robust increase of 13.5% compared to the $51.36 billion raised in 2022. This surge in capital raising underscores the sector's resilience and attractiveness to investors amidst evolving market conditions. The report also mentioned that the majority of the capital raised by REITs stemmed from debt offerings, totaling $44.87 billion."", ""REIT stocks are gaining popularity among Americans, largely due to the sector's positive performance. A report by Nareit indicated that by the end of 2023, approximately 168 million Americans, representing about 50% of US households, had invested in REIT stocks. REIT investors have historically expressed concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on the sector's performance. This is primarily because higher interest rates tend to lower property values and increase borrowing costs for REITs. Additionally, as interest rates rise, the relatively high dividend yields offered by REITs become less appealing compared to lower-risk fixed-income securities, reducing their attractiveness to income-oriented investors. However, historical data suggests that the performance of REIT stocks during periods of high-interest rates may not be as dire as commonly feared. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, since the early 1970s, there have been six significant periods of rising 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields. In four of these periods, US REITs delivered positive total returns, with half of them even outperforming the S&P 500 index. In one instance, both US REITs and the S&P 500 exhibited nearly identical performances, while in only two instances the S&P 500 outperformed US REITs."", 'Considering their past performance, analysts have presented a positive outlook for the REIT sector in 2024. As mentioned above, the capital market activity within the sector has significantly grown last year, which would positively impact the sector’s productivity this year. Furthermore, Nareit noted that the REIT sector has shown superior performance compared to both private real estate and equities during periods following interest rate hikes. Given that the Federal Reserve is either at or nearing the conclusion of its interest rate hike cycle, this is promising for the outlook of REIT performance in 2024.

With the S&P 500 setting fresh records, many stocks are trading near -- if not at -- their all-time highs.', ""Yet there are always areas of the market that have fallen out of favor. Currently, investors are moving away from consumer staples giants like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) due to their relatively weak short-term growth prospects. The beverage and snack food giant is facing some demand challenges, to be sure. But that's no reason to abandon this successful business. So let's look at why you might want to buy Pepsi's shareholder-friendly stock while it's trading close to its 52-week low."", ""The stock's poor performance lately can be pinned entirely on Pepsi's slowing growth rate. Organic sales rose a healthy 10% in 2023 on top of big gains a year earlier, but things started to change for the worse in Q4. Growth decelerated to 4.5% from 9% in the prior quarter and management sees the slowdown continuing at least through fiscal 2024."", ""Two big factors are driving this moderation, though neither means that Pepsi is losing market share. Instead, shoppers are reverting to their pre-pandemic grocery spending habits after several years of elevated demand for snack foods and at-home beverage products. That shift is happening while inflation slows to further pressure sales growth. Together, these trends have Pepsi projecting that organic sales gains will land at just 4% this year, or less than half of last year's expansion rate."", ""Pepsi's efficient business can do a lot with modest growth, though."", 'Earnings jumped 14% last year to outpace the 10% sales boost for the period. In other words, Pepsi grew sales while also widening its profit margin. Investors can expect to see another margin improvement in 2024 as the company cuts costs and focuses on popular niches like energy drinks and sparkling waters. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team are aiming to increase earnings at an 8% rate this year while sales rise by 4%.', ""Meanwhile, you'll get plenty of direct cash returns by holding this dividend stock. In early February, Pepsi announced a 7% boost to its annual dividend payout, marking its 52nd consecutive hike. Few consumer-facing companies can claim anything approaching that half-century streak, and that's a testament to Pepsi's enduring competitive strengths."", ""The dividend increase, plus Pepsi's falling stock price, has pushed the yield up to about 3% from a low of 2.3% nearly a year ago. Pepsi's proven commitment to robust cash-sharing with shareholders indicates that dividends are likely to keep growing for the foreseeable future."", ""In addition to that immediate income, you'll get exposure to some potentially market-thumping capital appreciation with this stock. Pepsi shares are trading at about 10% above their 52-week lows, after all. The valuation is sitting at 2.6 times annual sales compared to the more than 3 times sales that investors were paying last May. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), for context, is priced at nearly 6 times revenue."", ""Pepsi isn't as profitable as that rival beverage giant, but it has a good chance at lifting sales and operating profit margin for yet another year in 2024. It won't matter to the investing thesis whether that growth is a bit below what investors have seen in the past several years."", ""Combined with a rising dividend payment, these steady gains should help you see attractive returns from holding this strong, but currently unloved dividend stock.
