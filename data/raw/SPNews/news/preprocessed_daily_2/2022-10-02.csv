When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, sold US$19m worth of shares at a price of US$69.43 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$71.87, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 0.2% of Charles Schwab's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Charles Schwab shares. In total, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab sold US$34m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Charles Schwab insiders own 6.2% of the company, currently worth about US$8.4b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Charles Schwab shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Charles Schwab is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Charles Schwab and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Of course Charles Schwab may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$507. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own about US$326m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company).

If you want to see some more stocks that made their way into the headlines this week, go directly to Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.The markets remained volatile this week as the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ each fell by around 3%. Despite the more attractive valuations, the markets likely fell this week due to continued concern that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to fight inflation.The Federal Reserve has already increased the interest rate by 5 times this year and there could be even further increases with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic saying, ""The lack of progress thus far has me thinking much more now that we have to get to a moderately restrictive stance. And for me, that is in the 4.25% to 4.5% range for our policy. My preference is that we get there by year end.""If interest rates continue to go up, the economy could slow as borrowing costs increase.Amid the market decline, several stocks such as NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) were in the spotlight this week for various reasons. Furthermore other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended.7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexels10. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) fell over 14% this week with much of the drop occurring after the clothing giant reported rising inventories and lower margins for Q1. For the period, Nike's inventories rose 44% year over year and its gross margins fell 220 basis points. Furthermore, the company expects FY23 gross margins to decline by 200 to 250 basis points for FY2023. Given the challenges, Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital cut his price target on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to $110 from $128 but kept an 'Outperform' rating. Siegel still likes NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in the long term given the company's scale and other competitive advantages.Story continues9. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) declined over 21% this week given the company reported Q3 EPS of -$0.65 versus the consensus of -$0.13. Sales for the company were $4.31 billion, versus the consensus of $5.07 billion. Q4 might not be as great as the company also said its Q4 cumulative advance bookings were 'below the historical range'. Given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s debt, the stock could be very volatile depending on how demand changes. If future bookings are weaker, demand for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) could not be as high as expected.8. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) fell 14.7% this week given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s Q3 results and advance bookings commentary. Given that they are in the same sector, demand for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) could be affected by the same factors as Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL). If advance bookings is weaker for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), they might not be as strong for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL).7. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) fell over 16% this week with much of the drop likely due to the Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) news. Since they are in the same sector, demand for cruises from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as strong if demand for cruises for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) are weaker than expected. If demand isn't as strong, the earnings results of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as great. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) are down 45% year to date.6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declined by 4.8% this week due to the broader market decline of 3%. Although Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) can potentially earn more money if interest rates go higher, the bank could also lose money if the economy slows too much. If that happens, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) write-offs might increase. Shares of the stock are down 32% year to date.Some other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended this week.Click to continue reading and see Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.Suggested articles:10 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire George Soros10 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire Bill GatesWarren Buffett’s 10 Favorite Dividend Stocks for the Rest of 2022Disclosure: None.

5,5b1a613e-2c4b-3c56-b447-b719786347d1,IT,2022-10-02,7 Undervalued Reddit Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Catches On,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-reddit-stocks-buy-210017197.html,1664398817,STORY,"['TA', 'ME', 'IT', 'TLRY', 'HOOD']","[Images of soaring prices and investor gains may immediately come to mind when we think of the stock market. And while this is often the reality, there are also times when markets undergo periods of decline or bear markets. Interestingly, these bear markets can sometimes work in favor of investors, resulting in undervalued stocks to buy. This is because during down markets, retail investors, like those on the popular social media platform Reddit in particular, become more conservative with their investments. They tend to flock toward stable and well-established companies. As a result, stocks from newer companies — often perceived as riskier ventures — may be undervalued during these times.So if you’re looking for promising undervalued Reddit stocks to buy, now may be the perfect time to explore your options and invest in some of the top companies on this popular online platform. Whether you’re looking for fast-growing startups or established giants with proven track records, there’s sure to be a Reddit stock that fits your investment goals and budgetary needs.So, explore the following eight undervalued Reddit stocks today — they might pay off big time in the long run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUndervalued Reddit Stocks: Robinhood (HOOD)hood stock: An image of a wallet with a coin in it, a cellphone on top depicting Robinhood logo. Robinhood cryptoSource: salarko/ShutterstockRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a commission-free online broker that has become very popular with young investors. The company has been growing rapidly and has up to 22.9 million as of June 2022. Alongside the broader markets, Robinhood lost considerable market value in the last six months. However, there are secular trends in Robinhood’s favor, which will help the stock mount a comeback.Robinhood’s average user age is 28-41, meaning that a big part of the customer base skews younger than the traditional stock broker. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) believes the platform can become the Charles Schwab for millennials and Generation Z. It is high praise but not unfounded. The younger generation wants convenience with their trading and gets it through applications like Robinhood.Story continuesFor now, investors are cautious because of the wider economic downturn, leading to negative sentiment surrounding the stock. However, it will not always remain this way. Many analysts believe we might see the back of this bear market by December 2022 or sooner. Regardless, the economy’s boom and bust cycle suggests we could be out of the woods soon. That will mean more growth for Robinhood moving forward.In the meantime, Robinhood is adding to its platform and offerings. Despite cryptocurrencies being down since the start of the year, Robinhood has continued adding more coins you can buy. Now you can purchase Aave (AAVE-USD), Tezos (XTZ-USD), and USCoin (USDC-USD) aside from the usual hitters in the crypto space.DocuSign (DOCU)Docusign (DOCU) logo on a phone screen with stock charts in backgroundSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.comDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) is a rapidly growing company that specializes in electronic signatures and document management. With its easy-to-use platform and reliable technology, DocuSign has quickly become one of the leading e-signature providers in the industry. And with its rising popularity among businesses around the world, DocuSign is also becoming an increasingly attractive investment opportunity. So if you’re looking for undervalued Reddit stocks to buy and hold over the long term, DocuSign should be at the top of your list.DocuSign curried favor with investors and users alike during the pandemic. Whether signing a contract or filing your taxes online, DocuSign became the go-to solution for seamlessly managing digital workflows.As a result, the company experienced tremendous revenue and user base growth. Over the past three fiscal years, DocuSign’s annual revenue has steadily increased, with a 45.02% increase from 2022 to 2021, a 49.19% increase from 2021 to 2020, and a 38.95% increase from 2020 to 2019. However, shares are down almost 70% this year as investors fear the growth story is over with people returning to their offices.While it is a valid concern, those with a buy-and-hold investing strategy will value this company because of its huge total addressable market (TAM). Per a report from Straits Research, the signature market is projected to grow from $4.4 billion in 2021 to $42 billion by 2030. The recent Owl Lab State of Remote Work report found that 16% of companies worldwide are fully remote, while 63% offer a hybrid or remote-first option. All of this means the work-from-home trend is not going anywhere, and DOCU has what it takes to take advantage.Undervalued Reddit Stocks: Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba (BABA) logo displayed on phone screen in person's handsSource: Jirapong Manustrong / Shutterstock.comAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is one of the most discussed companies on Reddit, and for a good reason. Dubbed the “Amazon of China,” Alibaba has become a titan in the Chinese market, dominating many different sectors, from retail to online payments to streaming video. What makes Alibaba so unique is its innovative use of technology to improve the experience for both businesses and consumers.Whether you are part of the Alibaba community or simply an observer learning about this tech giant’s rise to power, Alibaba is a company that is well worth analyzing when discussing undervalued Reddit stocks to buy.The company is blessed with multiple business lines that benefit from secular tailwinds. At the same time, due to its substantial resources, the company is taking a foray into lucrative areas like cloud computing. One of our conglomerate’s units, Alibaba Cloud, launched an initiative called Project AsiaForward. This will provide $1 billion in funding for startups to help grow their businesses and scale operations. It will further entrench the company’s cloud units in a roughly $158 billion market. Alibaba Cloud, known as Aliyun locally, is already a very healthy business, generating $11.76 billion from its global sales in 2022. It is also thriving, turning profitable in the December 2021 quarter.Some investors might ask why the company is down by double this year despite a great operating model. The reason is due to the general investing atmosphere in China at this time and the U.S.-China trade tensions. Recently, the Biden administration has placed restrictions on semiconductor exports to China. In addition, Alibaba is one of the companies selected by U.S. regulators for an audit recently to ensure it does not violate any accounting laws.Nio (NIO)NIO store sign and customer in electric car store. NIO is a Chinese EV companySource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comNio (NYSE:NIO) is a great investment for anyone looking to get in on the ground floor of China’s booming electric vehicle market. This is largely thanks to Nio’s strategic partnership with the Hefei city government in central Anhui province. With a local government endorsement, Nio can navigate China’s notoriously complex regulatory environment more easily, allowing it to focus its efforts on selling and expanding its business.What’s more, Nio has been thriving on the sales front, racking up impressive growth numbers quarter after quarter. In Q3, despite a very difficult sales environment, Nio delivered a very healthy 31,607 vehicles, up 29.3% year-over-year. Unlike many other companies still in the development stage, Nio is already a proven performer in the EV space.Overall, Nio represents an exciting opportunity for investors who want to capitalize on China’s rapidly growing EV industry. With so much momentum behind it and the backing of a powerful government partner, Nio is sure to be a winner for years to come.Undervalued Reddit Stocks: Walmart (WMT)A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has been a true performer over the past few decades, earning a reputation as a stable and reliable company that consistently delivers solid returns for investors. While Walmart may not offer the enormous growth potential of other companies in various sectors, it can maintain strong margins thanks to its broad base of loyal customers who consistently purchase essential products at this one-stop shop.Furthermore, with inflation running rampant across the board, Walmart will continue to do well because it sells affordable, everyday items that people need to make ends meet. In fact, Walmart is one company that can benefit from an economic downturn since so many other businesses struggle when consumers have less disposable income and cannot spend on luxuries.In addition, the retail heavyweight is a Dividend Aristocrat. It is a hard-won title after 25 years of continuous dividend hikes. Considering the solid business model, the stock’s dividend is very secure, making Walmart among the top income plays among undervalued Reddit stocks to buy.Disney (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockDisney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most iconic brands in the world, known for its innovative and groundbreaking films and theme parks. With a strong focus on entertainment, Disney has expanded across different business lines to become a truly multifaceted company. From its Disney Studios and Disney Parks to Disney Consumer Products and Disney Interactive, Disney today touches almost every aspect of modern pop culture. Whether producing blockbuster animated films or developing cutting-edge virtual reality technology, Disney continues to set the standard for high-quality entertainment. And with its continued success, Disney shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.One of Disney’s most cutting-edge ventures is Disney+, a streaming service that has quickly risen to become the top streaming company in the world. With a massive content library that includes beloved Disney classics and original shows and films, Disney+ attracts millions of users daily. And with its forward-thinking approach to content creation and distribution, Disney+ shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Disney’s position as an entertainment juggernaut is unshakeable, making it one of the world’s most successful companies.Undervalued Reddit Stocks: Netflix (NFLX)the netflix logo displayed on a tablet that a person is holding while laying downSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.comWith its acclaimed original content and massive catalog of movies and TV shows, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has long been a leader in the streaming industry. Despite some hiccups earlier this year, Netflix has reasserted its dominance with a strong third-quarter earnings report showing significant growth in subscribers and revenue. With over two million new subscribers since July, Netflix proved that it is still on track for continued success.The streaming company introduced an innovative ad-tier option that will be a huge money spinner for Netflix. Even though some users may balk at having to sit through ads while binging on their favorite series, it seems likely that this new format will be a huge hit with advertisers, who will flock to Netflix as yet another platform on which they can reach their target audiences.So while Netflix may have initially been met with skepticism and doubt when it first disrupted the entertainment industry, it’s clear that this innovative company is here to stay – and poised to make even bigger waves in the coming years.Gartner (IT)Person holding cellphone with logo of US research company Gartner Inc.

The Bank of England’s counter move against the Truss administration’s lunacy of slashing taxes and boosting expenditure at the same time was what got the pound - and other most other currencies - up against the dollar.But will the USD roar back to its 20-year highs in the week ahead?It just might. A litany of Federal Reserve speakers did all they could last week to talk up the Fed’s mission of using super-sized rate hikes to bust inflation - and in the process sent the Dollar Index to a new 2022 peak of 114.75 on Wednesday before the BoE’s intervention to prop up the battered pound.“A recession will not stop the Fed from hiking rates,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said. “Fed got wrong the persistence and magnitude of inflation. Given the persistence of inflation, it is still more important to ensure that the Fed does enough.”U.S. inflation remains “very high” and could continue to shock as the Fed works on subduing the worst price pressures in four decades for Americans, Vice Chair Lael Brainard declared Friday. “Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target,” Brainard added.If there’s one thing Fed people have been good at the past year, it’s in talking the U.S. economy towards a recession. The only reason we haven’t gotten into one is because of a job market that just refuses to give up.But push as hard the Fed is doing - and many say the central bank has no choice but to crash the economy now if it is to rescue it from inflation that could do worse later - then the Fed may just get its way.And central to the Fed’s mission - maybe not intentionally - is this year’s massive ramp-up in the USD as the Dollar Index stands nearly 20% higher versus the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.Story continuesThe dollar’s surge has put other nations trying to boost their economies in a challenging position: raising interest rates would boost their currency but also put the brakes on economic recovery. China, which has slashed interest rates to tackle a slowing economy and stem a housing downturn, has seen the yuan fall to its weakest level in more than 14 years. The People's Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters. The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report.The dollar’s withering impact on almost every commodity is evident this year, especially oil, where U.S. crude at under $80 a barrel sits with an annual gain of just 6% now versus some 50% back in March when it was at around $130.On Friday, oil bulls again struggled to emerge from negative territory after another surprisingly higher U.S. inflation print for August reinforced expectations for more super-sized Fed rate hikes.This was despite oil bulls being charged up ahead of next week’s meeting of the OPEC+ alliance of 23 oil producers and exporters. The 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 10 Russia-steered allies are to meet on Wednesday to finalize output quotas for November.Friday’s pressure on oil and other risk assets came after data showed the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, grew 6.2% during the year to August, versus 6.4% in the 12 months to July.Economists polled by US media had expected the so-called PCE Index to expand by just 6% during the year to August.On a monthly basis, the PCE Index actually grew more in August than in July, rising 0.3% from a previous 0.1%. Economists had expected a monthly growth of just 0.2% in August.The readings showed the Fed’s battle against inflation had barely eased despite sharp drops in gasoline prices over the past three months.Gold, in contrast, posted a modest weekly gain as safe-haven ideas apparently crept back into the trade on the back of renewed recession fears - helping bullion’s longs catch a break from the resurgent dollar after a largely miserable September.For the month though, bullion was down 3%, while for the quarter, it tumbled 7.5% for its worst quarter since March 2021.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for November delivery did a final trade of $79.74, after officially settling Friday’s session at $79.49 per barrel, down $1.74, or 2.1%, on the day.U.S. crude’s strong run-up between Tuesday and Wednesday, however, held the market in good stead for a small weekly gain in five, despite major losses for September and the third quarter - the first quarterly loss for oil in two years.For the week, WTI was up almost 1%. For the month, however, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 12.5%. For the third quarter, it was down 24%.Brent, the London-traded global benchmark for oil, did a final trade of $85.56 on its December contract, after officially settling Friday’s session at $85.14, down $2.04, or 2.3%.“The crude demand outlook is not getting any favors from economic data or corporate reports,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “OPEC+ will have an easy job next week, but oil prices won’t catch a bid until energy traders are confident an aggressive reduction of output at around 1 million bpd will be delivered. Brent crude is poised to consolidate below the $90 level.”Russia is pushing OPEC+ to cut output by a substantial 1.0 million barrels per day or around that, those familiar with the Kremlin’s thinking have said. But Moscow is unlikely to contribute much to any production cut by the alliance due to the ongoing impact on its energy exports from Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.The Russians have also been undercutting others in OPEC+ by selling their crude at heavily discounted rates to buyers like China and India. A production cut by OPEC+ that Moscow does not fully participate in will benefit Russia more than the rest of the alliance as it might continue to steal customers from the others.Also, OPEC+ has not met its monthly production targets for months, so any quotas announced by the group might be virtually meaningless. Case in point: A Reuters survey published Friday found OPEC+ raised its September crude oil production to the highest level since 2020 - yet failed to meet its September quota. Thus, on the way down too, the alliance might fall short of its target.Oil: Price OutlookOil seems stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the Fed’s indirect support of the dollar and OPEC’s ministrations likely to pull crude both ways, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Amidst prolonged volatility WTI continues with bearish innings for four months,” Dixit said.He observed that with WTI below the monthly middle Bollinger Band of $82.20 after its test of $76.28, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence has begun printing a negative histogram while the monthly stochastics reading of 26/40 shows enough room for a further drop.“The next drop brings the 200-Month Simple Moving Average of $72.35 on the radar,” Dixit said. “Breaching through $72.35 will extend the correction to the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $70.”He said positive grinding on the weekly stochastics of 9/6 may give WTI bulls “some breathing space” if prices exhibit recovery beyond the daily middle Bollinger Band of $83.75, above which the 50-Day EMA of $88.85 sits.“Overall, the broader formation is perfectly bearish as confirmed by four months of negativity back-to-back. For now, $72 - $70 remain the nearest downside targets, while the 200-week SMA of $63.35 sits as the long-term support for trend reversal.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold’s benchmark futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,668.30, after officially closing Friday’s session up $3.40, or 0.2%, at $1,672 per ounce.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, officially settled last week at $1,660.98, up 37 cents, or 0.02%.Gold’s four-day rebound reached a climax Friday when the spot price hit a one-week high of $1,675.35 after data showing another surprisingly higher U.S. inflation print for August that reinforced expectations for more super-sized Federal Reserve rate hikes. Gold is often seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and Fed rate increases.“Inflation expectations matter and … things are starting to look better for gold,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Despite Moya’s positive views, some analysts were less impressed with bullion’s outlook.“Despite the price recently hitting a two-year high, it has been an inferior hedge, and the opportunity costs have been high,” Robert Cyran said in a commentary on gold Friday. “An investment 10 years ago in the S&amp;P 500 Index would have tripled.”Six straight months of negative closes have taken spot gold down $460 from a $2073 record high. US inflation at a four-decade high and the drawn-out Russia-Ukraine war have not been able to stir gold’s safe-haven standing as investors took their cues instead from the Fed’s super-sized rate hikes and the runaway dollar.Gold: Price Outlook “Oversold conditions make a case for short term rebound towards broken support turned resistance zone $1,680 - $1,700,” Dixit of SKCharting said in his outlook on spot gold.Dixit said bears seemed to prefer to let gold rise a little so that they can reposition their shorts at those highs, citing aiming retest of $1,600 and $1, 560 which corresponds to 50% Fibonacci retracement of $1046 - $2073.Spot gold’s positive overlap on the weekly stochastics reading of 19/10 does call for a short-term rebound towards the 200 week SMA of $1680, followed by a $1710 horizontal resistance, Dixit said.“If gold finds acceptance above $1710, the rebound can very well extend to next resistance zone of weekly middle Bollinger Band $1765 and the 50-Week EMA of $1795, followed by the 100-week SMA of $1814,” he said.The short-term horizon has potential only for a short-range rebound with the possibility of a drop towards $1640 and $1620, Dixit said.“If the $1640-$1620 zone is breached, then gold can drop to $1,600 and $1,560 over the next few weeks,” he said. “On an immediate basis, $1645-$1638 would attract buyers aiming retest of $1681 and $1697-$1710.""Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOPEC+ Will Consider Output Cut of More Than 1 Million BarrelsGazprom says gas exports to Europe via Ukraine steady on Sunday]"

9,0f9c9f9f-b9ef-352a-a28a-8b5a943fb0bc,MRO,2022-10-02,7 Under-$50 Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-under-50-sleeper-stocks-194101558.html,1664394061,STORY,"['TAP-A', 'MRO', 'ALLY', 'GM', 'LEU', 'PPC', 'SUN']","[After covering market ideas under $10 and later under $20, it’s now time to go up the standalone denomination chain of the Federal Reserve note spectrum and discuss under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy before Wall Street wakes up. The narrative is simple. Your boss likes your work and decides to give you a raise. With half a Benjamin in your hand, your breadth of choices just expanded significantly.Still, it’s a troubled market out there. With the Federal Reserve recently raising the benchmark interest rate to combat inflation, deflationary forces now impact the market. Left to extend to its extremes, deflation could create a passive incentive to do nothing. The purchasing power of the dollar rises, automatically creating positive returns for the apathetic. Admittedly, that’s not a great backdrop for under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.Nevertheless, these market ideas feature a relevant business profile that Wall Street doesn’t seem to be appreciating. You could take advantage of this lack of trust and perhaps foresight, provided you can accept the risks. If so, below are seven under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsALLYAlly Financial$28.10MROMarathon Oil$22.67SUNSunco$38.60PPCPilgrim’s Pride$23.73LEUCentrus Energy$43.12GMGeneral Motors$35.35TAPMolson Coors$48.29Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comA bank holding company, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) provides a range of services, including car financing, online banking, corporate lending and mortgage loans. It even has an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets, a feature that undoubtedly came in handy during the heyday of the post-pandemic new normal.At the time of writing, Ally Financial printed a price tag of $28.10. The company has a market capitalization of $8.67 billion. Since the start of this year, ALLY lost 38% of its value in the equities sector. It’s not difficult to understand why given the Fed’s deflationary pivot.Story continuesFundamentally, though, a deflationary cycle may inspire greater demand for Ally’s wealth management arm. When the purchasing power of the dollar rises, an investment opportunity must be so compelling that someone will be willing to set aside free positive returns. Ally’s professional financial advisors — as opposed to YouTube gurus — can help navigate clients to upside success.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com considers ALLY significantly undervalued. Ally features a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 3.9 times, well below the industry median rating of 8 times.Marathon Oil (MRO)marathon oil (MRO stock) logo on a screenSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn American company concentrating on hydrocarbon exploration, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) benefitted handsomely from the energy security paradigm of 2022. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine setting off sanctions and retaliatory responses, the end result appears to be the Kremlin cutting off critical commodities to Western nations. Thus, MRO could swing higher.Because of the high profile of Marathon, it’s not broadly considered an under-$50 sleeper stock. At the time of writing, MRO sits at $22.67 in the open market, gaining 6% for the day. Since the start of the year, MRO has gained nearly 38%. However, in the trailing month, shares have plunged 13%. Thus, Marathon is a sleeper in that stakeholders seem to be rushing to the exits recently.Fundamentally, the deflationary forces at work pose problems for commodities. However, with Russia’s partial military mobilization, it appears Moscow committed the nation to the bitter end. That should cynically be net positive for MRO based on implied lower energy inventory levels.Sunoco (SUN)Ecology, alternative sustainable energy and environment protection saving business concept, GEVOSource: Oleksiy Mark / Shutterstock.comA master limited partnership, Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) specializes in fuel distribution. Technically, this concept aligns with the downstream component of the hydrocarbon industry. In contrast, a company like Marathon Oil above focuses on the upstream side of the energy sector.Presently, Sunoco features a price tag of $38.60. It also has a market cap of $3.2 billion. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SUN has slipped a bit below 5%. Relatively speaking, that’s not bad at all considering the crimson ink in the major equity indices.However, in the trailing month, SUN fell nearly 7%. Nevertheless, the combination of its underlying relevance and diminished market performance suggests that Sunoco is one of the best under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.Fundamentally, the downstream component presents much intrigue because of baseline inelastic demand. While fuel consumption behaviors change based on economic conditions, the baseline demand — or the consumption necessary to travel for essential purposes — remains largely the same. Thus, if you don’t mind the extra paperwork associated with MLPs, SUN could be an intriguing opportunity.Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC)Source: ShutterstockAn American multinational food company, Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) represents one of the largest chicken producers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As well, it’s the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. Given the necessity of food to humans, Pilgrim’s Pride offers a cynical idea for under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, PPC stock commands a price of $23.73. The company has a market value of $5.88 billion. Although Pilgrim’s Pride features an indelible business narrative, its stock has fallen nearly 17% so far this year. In the trailing month, PPC has shed almost 20% of equity value.While a risky idea, I’m going to borrow from Mr. InvestorPlace himself, Louis Navellier. “The poultry and pork products processor is profiting handsomely from rising meat prices that are stinging consumers’ pocketbooks. The company says it expects to earn $3.31 per share in earnings in 2022, up from 13 cents EPS in 2021 and 39 cents EPS in 2020.”Centrus Energy (LEU)clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in BelgiumSource: engel.ac / ShutterstockA nuclear fuel company, Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT:LEU) supplies nuclear fuel for use in nuclear power plants. It also works to develop and deploy advanced centrifuge technology to produce enriched uranium for commercial and government uses. Naturally, Centrus plays a critical role in national security.As of this writing, LEU stock has a price tag of $43.12. It’s one of the smaller companies on this list of under-$50 sleeper stocks, featuring a market cap of $624.7 million. While LEU has so far popped up 8% today, it’s down over 14% YTD. Nevertheless, contrarians will want to put Centrus on their radar.Politically, we can talk all day about renewable this and sustainable that. Scientifically, though, nuclear energy will likely always play a vital role in domestic and perhaps global energy profiles. No other commodity features the incredible energy density of nuclear fuel. One uranium fuel pellet, for instance, commands the same energy potential as 149 gallons of crude oil.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOne of the most iconic American companies, General Motors (NYSE:GM) represents the largest automaker in the U.S. Of course, this status hasn’t always yielded success, especially this year due to myriad economic headwinds. However, contrarians may want to consider this intriguing entry among under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, GM stock found itself priced at $35.35. Currently, the underlying automaker features a market cap of $51.5 billion. Since the start of the year, GM has hemorrhaged nearly 40% of equity value. Nevertheless, despite the crimson tide, the future appears bright for the company.Essentially, GM perfectly balances initiatives geared toward electric vehicles (EVs) and combustion cars. As you may have seen, GM advertised several upcoming EV models, including the electric-powered Hummer. On the combustion side, the automaker introduced the eighth-generation mid-engine Corvette. Sales for the Corvette remain impressive.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comA multinational drink and brewing company, Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) brings people together through imbibing strong beverages. You can tell that it’s not your typical offering, because Molson Coors’ website is age restricted. Moving forward, cynical undertones associated with this business may lift TAP as one of the under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, TAP barely qualifies for this list. It prints a price of $48.29. Currently, the company has a market cap of $10.5 billion. Notably, TAP outperformed several publicly traded companies so far this year, gaining half-a-percent above parity. Still, over the trailing month, shares have dipped 10%, suggesting some lack of appreciation here.Fundamentally, if the economy slips into a recession, demand for Molson Coors may rise. Two elements would possibly be at play. First, American consumers historically spend money for escapism purposes during hard times. Second, no offense to any Molson Coors fans, but most of the underlying products aren’t exactly a bottle of Louis XIII de Rémy Martin, you know what I mean?Thus, TAP could be an ideal play among under-$50 sleeper stocks if you anticipate a downturn.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see some more stocks that made their way into the headlines this week, go directly to Why These 5 Stocks Trended This Week.It was another volatile week on Wall Street as the major indexes each fell around 3% this week. Due to the decline, the S&amp;P 500 has had the worst September since 2002.Friday's increase of 0.6% for the month of August in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, didn't help as the market expected an increase of 0.5%. With the Federal Reserve remaining focused on containing inflation, many investors think the central bank will continue to increase interest rates. Indeed, the 2 year Treasury yield, which is a reflection of the expectations for the federal funds rate, was 4.206%.If the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates, bonds could become more attractive and stocks could become less attractive.Amid the decline in the market, many tech stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trended.Other stocks, such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) also were in the limelight this week.Applebrandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 8% this week after Bloomberg reported that Apple is pulling back from a production increase for the iPhone 14 given that the expected demand might not be as strong as previously anticipated. Given the iPhone accounts for a substantial percentage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s profits, weaker demand could make it more difficult for the company to grow EPS. Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America also downgraded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to 'Neutral' from 'Buy' and set a $160 price target, down from $185 this week.Story continues9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 258Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) declined by over 2% this week due to the broader market decline of around 3%. The stock also trended after Andrew Marok of Raymond James set an 'Outperform' rating and $300 price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), citing Microsoft's sustainable advantages in scale and deep relationships with many customers in enterprise. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are down around 31% year to date.8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 153Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) fell 3% this week, which was in-line with the decline of the major indexes such as the NASDAQ 100's 3% decline. Although TikTok could become a competitor to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s YouTube and search, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) still has a lot of advantages. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced it would shut down its Stadia streaming service this week.Lakehouse Capital mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in an investor letter in July 2022,Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported another strong quarterly result despite the tough macroeconomic conditions. Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency. Overall, we’re pleased with how the company has performed and are confident that management will be able to control costs, if or when the economic environment becomes more challenging.7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) fell 3.3% this week, slightly worse than the 3% decline in the NASDAQ. Investors remain concerned about TikTok's growth and some investors wonder if Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s metaverse investments will pay off. Although the market could be big, the metaverse will need a lot of investment in the beginning. Amid the market turmoil, Bloomberg reported that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is pausing hiring and planning to cut budgets across most teams.6. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell only 0.69% this week, versus the 3% decline in the NASDAQ. The company continues to benefit from positive analyst commentary. This week, Ronald Josey of Citi reiterated a 'Buy' rating and $185 price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), citing the company's refreshed device line-up that further advances Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s connected home vision. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are down 32% year to date.Stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) also trended this week.Click to continue reading and see Why These 5 Stocks Trended This Week.Suggested articles:10 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire George Soros10 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire Bill GatesWarren Buffett’s 10 Favorite Dividend Stocks for the Rest of 2022Disclosure: None.

The Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index is down 20% this year as consumers pull back on their spending. However, some consumer-focused companies have performed worse than others. Much worse. Whether it is due to poor management, failure to adapt to a changing marketplace, or doomed deals, some consumer-oriented stocks have suffered 50% or more declines through the first nine months of the year. Many companies are clearly in jeopardy, and analysts question their long-term viability. Thus, investors would be best advised to avoid such companies in danger. With that in mind, here are the following seven consumer stocks to sell:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$153.25GPSGap Inc$8.69ULUnilever$43.67AEOAmerican Eagle Outfitters$10.46MMacy’s$16.49WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$32.59KHCKraft Heinz$33.34Target (TGT)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt may not die, but consumer retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sure hasn’t been the same coming out of the pandemic. The company has spent most of this year selling off excess inventory at deeply discounted prices as it adjusts to slowing consumer demand. The result has been that the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company has lowered its forward guidance twice this year, and its quarterly profit declined nearly 90% in the three months ended July 30. The turmoil has weighed heavily on TGT stock, down 36% on the year and trading at just over $150 a share.While some shareholders have called for new management, it was announced earlier in September that Target’s CEO Brian Cornell will remain in his position for three more years after Target did away with its mandatory retirement age of 65. Of course, Target may get its inventory back down to manageable levels. However, it is still grappling with inflationary pressures, slowing consumer spending, and ongoing supply chain constraints, likely to continue lowering its share price in the coming months. Thus, I believe Target is one of the top consumer stocks to sell.Story continuesGap Inc (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockIt’s been an equally ugly year for clothing retailer Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The San Francisco-based company has seen its stock price fall 65% in the last 12 months, including a 53% decline this year. GPS stock now trades at $8.69 and continues to slump. The most recent news out of the company is that it is laying off 500 employees, equal to about 5% of its 8,700 global workers. The job cuts come amid mounting losses and turmoil at the company’s upper echelons.In July, Gap announced that CEO Sonia Syngal was stepping down immediately after less than three years in the position. This is as sales continue to weaken across the board at Gap Inc and its other retail chain Old Navy. Even singer Kanye West has abandoned the Gap brand, announcing recently that he is terminating early his two-year promotional deal with Gap, citing “substantial noncompliance” with the terms of the contract. Et Tu Kanye?Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comGiven that it’s the largest maker of soap in the world, among many other consumer products, one would assume that shares of Unilever (NYSE:UL) would be pretty resilient to this year’s market downturn. But it is not. Unfortunately, UL stock is down 19% year to date and trading at $43.67 a share. This is even though Unilever makes many of the most beloved and essential consumer products worldwide, ranging from Dove soap to Sunlight laundry detergent and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream.The deflated share price comes as consumer spending rolls over and also as Unilever’s CEO prepares to exit the company. Also, Unilever is grappling with famed activist investor Nelson Peltz, who now has a seat on the company’s board of directors. Unilever CEO Alan Jope announced his plans to retire following a failed attempt to buy the consumer healthcare business of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). For his part, Peltz wants Unilever to become a leaner, more nimble company. Shortly after Peltz joined the board, Unilever announced plans to cut 1,500 management jobs and reshape its business.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)Source: ShutterstockLike Gap, clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) has had a bruising year. Since January, AEO stock has fallen 60% to trade at $10.46 a share. The Pittsburgh-based company is struggling with all the same challenges as the other companies on this list. Inflation, declining consumer spending, and supply constraints have hurt American Eagle Outfitters’ earnings. The company’s most recent financial results showed that its inventory levels rose 36.3%, even though its gross margins fell to 30.9% from 44.3%.Consequently, American Eagle Outfitters has been forced to deeply discount its clothing merchandise to sell and reduce its inventory levels. All the discounting led American Eagle Outfitters to report a second-quarter earnings-per-share (or EPS) profit of 4 cents, which was well below the 60 cents a share expected on Wall Street. The company also announced that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, which yielded a hefty 6.2%. The canceled dividend payment sent many shareholders rushing for the exits, making it one of they key consumer stocks to sell.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comIt seems like a long time ago now that department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) was thriving during the pandemic. But this year, M stock has plummeted 42% to change hands at $16.49 per share. The stock is far from its all-time high of $70 a share in 2015. While the company has traditionally thrived during the year-end holiday shopping season, Macy’s seemed to acknowledge that it doesn’t anticipate robust consumer spending this year, announcing that it plans to hire 41,000 seasonal workers for the holidays this year, 46% of the 76,000-holiday staff hired in 2021.Macy’s has been trying its best to navigate these uncertain times by enhancing its digital/online sales channels. But here, too, Macy’s has struggled. In its most recent quarter, the company announced that its digital sales declined 5% yearly. The company has announced a three-year plan to turn around its fortunes, which it calls “Polaris.” However, the plan seems to have underwhelmed analysts who cover the company. Macy’s most recently lowered its forward guidance and says it now expects fiscal 2022 revenue from $24.34 billion to $24.58 billion, down from previous forecasts of $24.46 billion to $24.7 billion. Thus, making it one of the consumer stocks to sell.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also did well during the pandemic when its more than 8,900 drugstores sprinkled across all 50 states dispensed Covid-19 vaccinations. But this year has been another story.Through nearly nine months of 2022, WBA stock is down 38% at around $32.59 a share. The stock has been deep-sixed since Walgreens announced plans to spend $5.2 billion to acquire the primary care company VillageMD last year.The plan is to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations within Walgreens outlets by 2027. The primary care locations will provide medical services to customers of Walgreens, combining direct medical treatments and pharmaceutical medicines under one roof. While that might sound good on paper, investors appear to be concerned with the hefty amount invested in VillageMD and a slowdown in consumer foot traffic at Walgreen locations coming out of the pandemic. Therefore, it will be a while before the VillageMD plan shows any results.Kraft Heinz (KHC)Heinz (KHC) ketchup bottle about to squeeze out ketchupSource: SSokolov / Shutterstock.comYou know it’s bad when legendary investor Warren Buffett says he regrets buying a stock. While the Oracle of Omaha still owns nearly $11 billion worth of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock, it is undoubtedly one of his worst investments. Over the past five years, KHC stock has fallen more than 60% to trade at $33.34 per share. Over the last ten years, the stock has declined 27%, leading many analysts to refer to Kraft Heinz as a value trap.The food company that makes everything from ketchup to cream cheese and owns popular brands such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs has seen its share price deflate since Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged in 2015 at a price tag of $49 billion, creating the third-largest food company in North America.While the merger, with its promised synergies and competitive advantages, lured many investors, including Buffett, those benefits have never really materialized. And that’s led to KHC stock steadily eroding over the past seven years, making it one of the top consumer stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

16,9d33c5ee-8ed3-3721-8ff3-fa8305034e4c,SBUX,2022-10-02,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 70% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-favoured-140105561.html,1664632865,STORY,['SBUX'],"[A look at the shareholders of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Starbucks, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Starbucks ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Starbucks?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Starbucks. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Starbucks' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Starbucks. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.4% and 3.9% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Howard Schultz directly holds 1.9% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in Starbucks Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.0b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Starbucks. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Starbucks is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are a bit concerning...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

20,abb653ae-221a-3de0-9853-8a9513a769ce,TJX,2022-10-02,"Has The TJX Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:TJX) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-inc-nyse-tjx-110147901.html,1664708507,STORY,['TJX'],"[TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 11% over the last three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on TJX Companies'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:62% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.62 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 62% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that TJX Companies has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 30% which is quite remarkable. For this reason, TJX Companies' five year net income decline of 2.6% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared TJX Companies' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 31% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TJX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 38% (where it is retaining 62% of its profits), TJX Companies has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, TJX Companies has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 37%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that TJX Companies' future ROE will be 68% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like TJX Companies has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

21,9dbd176a-f46c-3de9-a6d8-cc7d806f4e4a,NEM,2022-10-02,7 Best Precious Metals Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-precious-metals-stocks-165916922.html,1664384356,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'SI=F', 'NEM', 'BHP', 'FCX', 'SCCO', 'GOLD', 'RGLD']","[With precious metals prices continuing to move inversely to interest rates, some investors would say that the best precious metals stocks to own right now are none of them. If you view precious metals strictly through the lens of gold and silver, I can’t blame you. As inflation soared, gold and silver did not hold up their end of the bargain. And with interest rates rising, a stronger dollar is taking out another reason to own precious metals.But the precious metals sector is broader than gold and silver. And that’s where the opportunity comes in. Many of these metals are essential to manufacturing the products that will transform our economy. These sectors haven’t been immune from supply chain difficulties, and that has made it a choppy year for precious metals stocks.But according to 360 Research Reports, the demand for precious metals is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% between now and 2028. And I don’t want to forget about gold. According to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global gold mining market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% from now through 2026.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, at their core, precious metals are commodities, and that makes investing in them a volatile proposition. Here, however, are seven of the best precious metals stocks to buy now.NEMNewmont Corporation$41.84GOLDBarrick Gold$14.75RGLDRoyal Gold$91.36FCXFreeport-McMoRan$27.47SCCOSouthern Copper$44.13BHPBHP Group$49.45ValeVale$12.77Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockLeading off this list of the best precious metals stocks is Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). The stock of the largest miner in the world soared to an all-time high in March 2022. But NEM stock is down 34% since that time as mining stocks have struggled to grab the attention of investors.Newmont is in a cycle in which its revenue continues to grow but its earnings drop versus the prior year. Rising capital costs are largely to blame for the declines in the miner’s profits. The company says, however, that it’s still on track to extract 6 million ounces of gold this year.Story continuesNEM stock provides investors with a good buying opportunity because  it is prioritizing shareholder value in the midst of this market volatility.Due to Newmont’s rising capital costs, the company probably will not be able to sustain its current $2.20 per share dividend . But the company has a long history of paying a dividend. And with analysts’ median price target standing at over $63 per share, the owners of NEM stock may get the profits they expect when they invest in mining stocks.Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD)October 18, 2020, Brazil. In this photo illustration the B&amp;G Foods logo seen displayed on a smartphone. BGS stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSticking with gold stocks, I will  take a look at the Canadian multinational miner, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). Like Newmont, Barrick is an established mining company with a high-yield dividend.After soaring to over $25 per share earlier this year, GOLD stock fell 44% and is trading near its 52-week low. But analysts are largely still bullish about the stock, and their average price target suggests the shares could make it back to their 52-week high.One reason to believe that may happen is the company’s geographical reach. In a sector whose underlying economics can be challenging, having exposure to different countries may turn out to be a winning strategy.In the meantime, GOLD stock pays a nice dividend yield of 2.83% and has a payout ratio of around 35% that looks sustainable.Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockThe last gold-related stock on this list is Royal Gold Inc. (NYSE:RGLD), and I included it specifically because it’s not a mining stock. The company essentially profits from the royalties generated by its acquisitions and its investments. Although some of its businesses are still in the exploratory phase, many are established companies that are generating reliable revenue and profits.RGLD stock is well off its 52-week high set in April 2022. However, the stock is down 18% for the year, slightly outpacing the performance of the S&amp;P 500. And although analysts have lowered their price targets for the stock, their median target suggests it will make back most of its losses for the year.While investors wait, they can count on an attractive dividend that has been growing for the last 20 years. and equates to a dividend yield of 1.62%.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is another mining stock. However, rather than being exclusively engaged in gold mining, the company has an extensive footprint in copper mining.FCX stock rose as the  infrastructure bill made its way through the U.S. Congress. The rally indicated that the price of copper would climb after the bill was passed. But macroeconomic challenges have blunted the demand for copper, hurting the short-term outlook of FCX stock.The company’s second-quarter revenue and earnings fell versus the previous quarter. That broke a streak of eight consecutive quarters of sequential gains, suggesting that the demand for copper is slowing.This may well be a case, however, of demand delayed rather than demand denied. If the United States remains committed to an electric-vehicle future, the demand for copper will have to rise.Southern Copper (SCCO)Piece of copper set against black backgroundSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.comAnother company that will benefit from rising copper demand is Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO). The Phoenix, Arizona-based mining company produces refined gold, silver, and other precious metals, including copper. The company’s primary operations are in South America.SCCO stock is down 28% for the year, and the company’s current quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share is likely to come down. Still, the company has offered a dividend for many years, and it was upgraded by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).It really comes down to timing for investors. The commodities market isn’t going to tell them exactly when demand will increase. So if you have speculative cash to put into this sector, Southern Copper could be an attractive choice because it pays you a dividend while you’re waiting for commodities to rebound.BHP Group (BHP)One bar of silver has been pulled out from a larger pile.Source: ShutterstockSo far, we’ve looked at companies that offer investors solid balance sheets, but ones that may be currently overvalued. BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) offers investors the benefit of a solid balance sheet. But it does appear to be undervalued in the current market. The company has a price–earnings ratio of 5.7 times which is below its historical average of 7.25 times.The Australian mining company extracts and sells a range of metals including copper, silver, zinc nickel, uranium, iron ore, gold and molybdenum. Copper and nickel will likely be in high demand as the world pivots toward clean energy.And another InvestorPlace columnist, Josh Enomoto, recently reminded investors that BHP Group is a major producer of potash. The latter commodity has been in short supply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That  hasn’t been enough to keep BHP stock from turning negative for the year. But with the stock down “only” 8% in 2022, investors could do worse.Vale (VALE)Vale Stock Looks Strong Going Into 2020 After January's Brazil Dam BurstSource: ShutterstockThe last company on this list of the best precious metals stocks is Vale (NYSE:VALE) – the world’s leading producer of iron ore and nickel. At first glance, its story seems the same as every stock on this list because, like the other names, it is down for the year and pays a dividend.That’s the nature of this sector in 2022. And I can’t say for sure when the sector is going to turn around. But if you’re considering investing in Vale, you should do so because it provides a commodity that will be in high demand. Specifically, nickel is a key component of lithium-ion batteries.That will be a long-term catalyst for VALE stock which, trading at three times its earnings, looks significantly undervalued compared to the forward P/E ratio of the mining industry which stands  at 9.6 times.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

23,e35ca4a6-636f-3481-8c35-d9a2b5a8c8cf,M,2022-10-02,7 Consumer Stocks to Sell Before They Die,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-stocks-sell-die-191650744.html,1664392610,STORY,['M'],"[This year, consumer stocks have been hammered as inflation lingers at 40-year highs and interest rates rise. The Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index is down 20% this year as consumers pull back on their spending. However, some consumer-focused companies have performed worse than others. Much worse. Whether it is due to poor management, failure to adapt to a changing marketplace, or doomed deals, some consumer-oriented stocks have suffered 50% or more declines through the first nine months of the year. Many companies are clearly in jeopardy, and analysts question their long-term viability. Thus, investors would be best advised to avoid such companies in danger. With that in mind, here are the following seven consumer stocks to sell:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$153.25GPSGap Inc$8.69ULUnilever$43.67AEOAmerican Eagle Outfitters$10.46MMacy’s$16.49WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$32.59KHCKraft Heinz$33.34Target (TGT)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt may not die, but consumer retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sure hasn’t been the same coming out of the pandemic. The company has spent most of this year selling off excess inventory at deeply discounted prices as it adjusts to slowing consumer demand. The result has been that the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company has lowered its forward guidance twice this year, and its quarterly profit declined nearly 90% in the three months ended July 30. The turmoil has weighed heavily on TGT stock, down 36% on the year and trading at just over $150 a share.While some shareholders have called for new management, it was announced earlier in September that Target’s CEO Brian Cornell will remain in his position for three more years after Target did away with its mandatory retirement age of 65. Of course, Target may get its inventory back down to manageable levels. However, it is still grappling with inflationary pressures, slowing consumer spending, and ongoing supply chain constraints, likely to continue lowering its share price in the coming months. Thus, I believe Target is one of the top consumer stocks to sell.Story continuesGap Inc (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockIt’s been an equally ugly year for clothing retailer Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The San Francisco-based company has seen its stock price fall 65% in the last 12 months, including a 53% decline this year. GPS stock now trades at $8.69 and continues to slump. The most recent news out of the company is that it is laying off 500 employees, equal to about 5% of its 8,700 global workers. The job cuts come amid mounting losses and turmoil at the company’s upper echelons.In July, Gap announced that CEO Sonia Syngal was stepping down immediately after less than three years in the position. This is as sales continue to weaken across the board at Gap Inc and its other retail chain Old Navy. Even singer Kanye West has abandoned the Gap brand, announcing recently that he is terminating early his two-year promotional deal with Gap, citing “substantial noncompliance” with the terms of the contract. Et Tu Kanye?Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comGiven that it’s the largest maker of soap in the world, among many other consumer products, one would assume that shares of Unilever (NYSE:UL) would be pretty resilient to this year’s market downturn. But it is not. Unfortunately, UL stock is down 19% year to date and trading at $43.67 a share. This is even though Unilever makes many of the most beloved and essential consumer products worldwide, ranging from Dove soap to Sunlight laundry detergent and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream.The deflated share price comes as consumer spending rolls over and also as Unilever’s CEO prepares to exit the company. Also, Unilever is grappling with famed activist investor Nelson Peltz, who now has a seat on the company’s board of directors. Unilever CEO Alan Jope announced his plans to retire following a failed attempt to buy the consumer healthcare business of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). For his part, Peltz wants Unilever to become a leaner, more nimble company. Shortly after Peltz joined the board, Unilever announced plans to cut 1,500 management jobs and reshape its business.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)Source: ShutterstockLike Gap, clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) has had a bruising year. Since January, AEO stock has fallen 60% to trade at $10.46 a share. The Pittsburgh-based company is struggling with all the same challenges as the other companies on this list. Inflation, declining consumer spending, and supply constraints have hurt American Eagle Outfitters’ earnings. The company’s most recent financial results showed that its inventory levels rose 36.3%, even though its gross margins fell to 30.9% from 44.3%.Consequently, American Eagle Outfitters has been forced to deeply discount its clothing merchandise to sell and reduce its inventory levels. All the discounting led American Eagle Outfitters to report a second-quarter earnings-per-share (or EPS) profit of 4 cents, which was well below the 60 cents a share expected on Wall Street. The company also announced that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, which yielded a hefty 6.2%. The canceled dividend payment sent many shareholders rushing for the exits, making it one of they key consumer stocks to sell.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comIt seems like a long time ago now that department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) was thriving during the pandemic. But this year, M stock has plummeted 42% to change hands at $16.49 per share. The stock is far from its all-time high of $70 a share in 2015. While the company has traditionally thrived during the year-end holiday shopping season, Macy’s seemed to acknowledge that it doesn’t anticipate robust consumer spending this year, announcing that it plans to hire 41,000 seasonal workers for the holidays this year, 46% of the 76,000-holiday staff hired in 2021.Macy’s has been trying its best to navigate these uncertain times by enhancing its digital/online sales channels. But here, too, Macy’s has struggled. In its most recent quarter, the company announced that its digital sales declined 5% yearly. The company has announced a three-year plan to turn around its fortunes, which it calls “Polaris.” However, the plan seems to have underwhelmed analysts who cover the company. Macy’s most recently lowered its forward guidance and says it now expects fiscal 2022 revenue from $24.34 billion to $24.58 billion, down from previous forecasts of $24.46 billion to $24.7 billion. Thus, making it one of the consumer stocks to sell.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also did well during the pandemic when its more than 8,900 drugstores sprinkled across all 50 states dispensed Covid-19 vaccinations. But this year has been another story.Through nearly nine months of 2022, WBA stock is down 38% at around $32.59 a share. The stock has been deep-sixed since Walgreens announced plans to spend $5.2 billion to acquire the primary care company VillageMD last year.The plan is to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations within Walgreens outlets by 2027. The primary care locations will provide medical services to customers of Walgreens, combining direct medical treatments and pharmaceutical medicines under one roof. While that might sound good on paper, investors appear to be concerned with the hefty amount invested in VillageMD and a slowdown in consumer foot traffic at Walgreen locations coming out of the pandemic. Therefore, it will be a while before the VillageMD plan shows any results.Kraft Heinz (KHC)Heinz (KHC) ketchup bottle about to squeeze out ketchupSource: SSokolov / Shutterstock.comYou know it’s bad when legendary investor Warren Buffett says he regrets buying a stock. While the Oracle of Omaha still owns nearly $11 billion worth of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock, it is undoubtedly one of his worst investments. Over the past five years, KHC stock has fallen more than 60% to trade at $33.34 per share. Over the last ten years, the stock has declined 27%, leading many analysts to refer to Kraft Heinz as a value trap.The food company that makes everything from ketchup to cream cheese and owns popular brands such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs has seen its share price deflate since Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged in 2015 at a price tag of $49 billion, creating the third-largest food company in North America.While the merger, with its promised synergies and competitive advantages, lured many investors, including Buffett, those benefits have never really materialized. And that’s led to KHC stock steadily eroding over the past seven years, making it one of the top consumer stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

25,b9d79d01-d3b2-3148-b0e9-9e8adef0466f,NOV,2022-10-02,Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-060234740.html,1664690554,STORY,"['GC=F', 'CL=F', '^GSPC']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- The dollar tumbled last week, giving bulls across commodity markets much-needed relief from the weight of a super strong greenback in five of the six previous weeks. The Bank of England’s counter move against the Truss administration’s lunacy of slashing taxes and boosting expenditure at the same time was what got the pound - and other most other currencies - up against the dollar.But will the USD roar back to its 20-year highs in the week ahead?It just might. A litany of Federal Reserve speakers did all they could last week to talk up the Fed’s mission of using super-sized rate hikes to bust inflation - and in the process sent the Dollar Index to a new 2022 peak of 114.75 on Wednesday before the BoE’s intervention to prop up the battered pound.“A recession will not stop the Fed from hiking rates,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said. “Fed got wrong the persistence and magnitude of inflation. Given the persistence of inflation, it is still more important to ensure that the Fed does enough.”U.S. inflation remains “very high” and could continue to shock as the Fed works on subduing the worst price pressures in four decades for Americans, Vice Chair Lael Brainard declared Friday. “Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target,” Brainard added.If there’s one thing Fed people have been good at the past year, it’s in talking the U.S. economy towards a recession. The only reason we haven’t gotten into one is because of a job market that just refuses to give up.But push as hard the Fed is doing - and many say the central bank has no choice but to crash the economy now if it is to rescue it from inflation that could do worse later - then the Fed may just get its way.And central to the Fed’s mission - maybe not intentionally - is this year’s massive ramp-up in the USD as the Dollar Index stands nearly 20% higher versus the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.Story continuesThe dollar’s surge has put other nations trying to boost their economies in a challenging position: raising interest rates would boost their currency but also put the brakes on economic recovery. China, which has slashed interest rates to tackle a slowing economy and stem a housing downturn, has seen the yuan fall to its weakest level in more than 14 years. The People's Bank of China has told major state-run banks to prepare to shed dollar holdings while snapping up offshore yuan, which has continued to fall despite prior interventions, sources told Reuters. The scale of this latest effort to prop up the yuan will be big and could provide a floor to the Chinese currency, according to the report.The dollar’s withering impact on almost every commodity is evident this year, especially oil, where U.S. crude at under $80 a barrel sits with an annual gain of just 6% now versus some 50% back in March when it was at around $130.On Friday, oil bulls again struggled to emerge from negative territory after another surprisingly higher U.S. inflation print for August reinforced expectations for more super-sized Fed rate hikes.This was despite oil bulls being charged up ahead of next week’s meeting of the OPEC+ alliance of 23 oil producers and exporters. The 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 10 Russia-steered allies are to meet on Wednesday to finalize output quotas for November.Friday’s pressure on oil and other risk assets came after data showed the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, grew 6.2% during the year to August, versus 6.4% in the 12 months to July.Economists polled by US media had expected the so-called PCE Index to expand by just 6% during the year to August.On a monthly basis, the PCE Index actually grew more in August than in July, rising 0.3% from a previous 0.1%. Economists had expected a monthly growth of just 0.2% in August.The readings showed the Fed’s battle against inflation had barely eased despite sharp drops in gasoline prices over the past three months.Gold, in contrast, posted a modest weekly gain as safe-haven ideas apparently crept back into the trade on the back of renewed recession fears - helping bullion’s longs catch a break from the resurgent dollar after a largely miserable September.For the month though, bullion was down 3%, while for the quarter, it tumbled 7.5% for its worst quarter since March 2021.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for November delivery did a final trade of $79.74, after officially settling Friday’s session at $79.49 per barrel, down $1.74, or 2.1%, on the day.U.S. crude’s strong run-up between Tuesday and Wednesday, however, held the market in good stead for a small weekly gain in five, despite major losses for September and the third quarter - the first quarterly loss for oil in two years.For the week, WTI was up almost 1%. For the month, however, the U.S. crude benchmark was down 12.5%. For the third quarter, it was down 24%.Brent, the London-traded global benchmark for oil, did a final trade of $85.56 on its December contract, after officially settling Friday’s session at $85.14, down $2.04, or 2.3%.“The crude demand outlook is not getting any favors from economic data or corporate reports,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “OPEC+ will have an easy job next week, but oil prices won’t catch a bid until energy traders are confident an aggressive reduction of output at around 1 million bpd will be delivered. Brent crude is poised to consolidate below the $90 level.”Russia is pushing OPEC+ to cut output by a substantial 1.0 million barrels per day or around that, those familiar with the Kremlin’s thinking have said. But Moscow is unlikely to contribute much to any production cut by the alliance due to the ongoing impact on its energy exports from Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.The Russians have also been undercutting others in OPEC+ by selling their crude at heavily discounted rates to buyers like China and India. A production cut by OPEC+ that Moscow does not fully participate in will benefit Russia more than the rest of the alliance as it might continue to steal customers from the others.Also, OPEC+ has not met its monthly production targets for months, so any quotas announced by the group might be virtually meaningless. Case in point: A Reuters survey published Friday found OPEC+ raised its September crude oil production to the highest level since 2020 - yet failed to meet its September quota. Thus, on the way down too, the alliance might fall short of its target.Oil: Price OutlookOil seems stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the Fed’s indirect support of the dollar and OPEC’s ministrations likely to pull crude both ways, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Amidst prolonged volatility WTI continues with bearish innings for four months,” Dixit said.He observed that with WTI below the monthly middle Bollinger Band of $82.20 after its test of $76.28, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence has begun printing a negative histogram while the monthly stochastics reading of 26/40 shows enough room for a further drop.“The next drop brings the 200-Month Simple Moving Average of $72.35 on the radar,” Dixit said. “Breaching through $72.35 will extend the correction to the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $70.”He said positive grinding on the weekly stochastics of 9/6 may give WTI bulls “some breathing space” if prices exhibit recovery beyond the daily middle Bollinger Band of $83.75, above which the 50-Day EMA of $88.85 sits.“Overall, the broader formation is perfectly bearish as confirmed by four months of negativity back-to-back. For now, $72 - $70 remain the nearest downside targets, while the 200-week SMA of $63.35 sits as the long-term support for trend reversal.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold’s benchmark futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,668.30, after officially closing Friday’s session up $3.40, or 0.2%, at $1,672 per ounce.The spot price of bullion, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, officially settled last week at $1,660.98, up 37 cents, or 0.02%.Gold’s four-day rebound reached a climax Friday when the spot price hit a one-week high of $1,675.35 after data showing another surprisingly higher U.S. inflation print for August that reinforced expectations for more super-sized Federal Reserve rate hikes. Gold is often seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and Fed rate increases.“Inflation expectations matter and … things are starting to look better for gold,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Despite Moya’s positive views, some analysts were less impressed with bullion’s outlook.“Despite the price recently hitting a two-year high, it has been an inferior hedge, and the opportunity costs have been high,” Robert Cyran said in a commentary on gold Friday. “An investment 10 years ago in the S&amp;P 500 Index would have tripled.”Six straight months of negative closes have taken spot gold down $460 from a $2073 record high. US inflation at a four-decade high and the drawn-out Russia-Ukraine war have not been able to stir gold’s safe-haven standing as investors took their cues instead from the Fed’s super-sized rate hikes and the runaway dollar.Gold: Price Outlook “Oversold conditions make a case for short term rebound towards broken support turned resistance zone $1,680 - $1,700,” Dixit of SKCharting said in his outlook on spot gold.Dixit said bears seemed to prefer to let gold rise a little so that they can reposition their shorts at those highs, citing aiming retest of $1,600 and $1, 560 which corresponds to 50% Fibonacci retracement of $1046 - $2073.Spot gold’s positive overlap on the weekly stochastics reading of 19/10 does call for a short-term rebound towards the 200 week SMA of $1680, followed by a $1710 horizontal resistance, Dixit said.“If gold finds acceptance above $1710, the rebound can very well extend to next resistance zone of weekly middle Bollinger Band $1765 and the 50-Week EMA of $1795, followed by the 100-week SMA of $1814,” he said.The short-term horizon has potential only for a short-range rebound with the possibility of a drop towards $1640 and $1620, Dixit said.“If the $1640-$1620 zone is breached, then gold can drop to $1,600 and $1,560 over the next few weeks,” he said. “On an immediate basis, $1645-$1638 would attract buyers aiming retest of $1681 and $1697-$1710.""Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOPEC+ Will Consider Output Cut of More Than 1 Million BarrelsGazprom says gas exports to Europe via Ukraine steady on Sunday]"

It said gas transit through the country had been suspended after its grid operator refused to confirm transport nominations, or the amount Gazprom planned to ship.The Austrian government said Gazprom had not signed the contracts needed.""At the beginning of each gas year, various technical changes in the market model come into force,"" the energy ministry said in a statement. ""Contractual changes are necessary for this. These contracts have not yet been signed by Gazprom. Transport nominations for today could therefore not be accepted. A solution is currently being worked on at the technical level at full speed.""Story continuesNEW RULESA spokesperson for Eni said Austria continued to receive gas on its border with Slovakia.A spokesperson for Austria's OMV said supplies from Russia were not an issue. ""The volumes nominated for today's gas day were significantly higher for OMV today than of late,"" he said.Italy has secured additional gas imports this year from alternative suppliers to make up for a fall in flows from Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine.Russian gas now accounts for around 10% of Italian imports, down from around 40%, a source close to the matter said, while the share from Algeria and the Nordics has increased.Elsewhere, Gazprom cut natural gas supplies to Moldova by around 30%, Vadim Ceban, director of gas firm Moldovagaz, said.On Friday, Moldova's deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said Gazprom had warned it about the reduction.Spinu said on Saturday that technical problems caused the reduction and Moldova would ask Gazprom to increase supplies.(Reporting by Federico Maccioni and Francesca Landini in Milan; Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan in London, Michael Shields in Zurich, Alexander Tanas in Chisinau and Thomas Escritt in Berlin; Editing by David Holmes and Alexander Smith)]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Catherine Knupp, for US$2.2m worth of shares, at about US$217 per share.

So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Zoetis didn't buy any shares in the last year.

32,953d5c85-a8ee-3a3a-8be1-73415d1a0e41,NEE,2022-10-02,6 Critical Charts to Watch Ahead of the 2022 Midterm Elections,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-critical-charts-watch-ahead-170929067.html,1664384969,STORY,"['LMT', 'NEE', 'META', 'RGR', 'GOOGL']","[While the matter represents a contentious topic, investors must realize that the 2022 midterm elections will soon arrive. Further, with President Joe Biden’s administration generally struggling to forward its agenda, the upcoming battle for control of Congress will be crucial. Should the Republicans win, they can potentially gridlock the president, which would then set the framework for 2024.Now, if history is any guide, the Republicans stand a solid chance of taking both the House and the Senate. Without jumping on one side or the other, it’s probably fair to at least be prepared for a red wave during the 2022 midterm elections.According to data from U.C. Santa Barbara, in the “22 midterm elections from 1934-2018, the President’s party has averaged a loss of 28 House seats and four Senate seats. The president’s party gained seats in the House only three times, but gained seats in the Senate on six occasions. The president’s party has gained seats in both houses only twice.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo be clear, we live in extraordinary times, so it’s possible that the Democrats will pull a surprise for the 2022 midterm elections. Either way, below are critical stock charts to watch ahead of the votes.RGRSturm Ruger$50.77LMTLockheed Martin$401.39NEENextEra Energy$82.66METAMeta Platforms$139.59GOOGAlphabet$99.85HOGHarley-Davidson$37.26Sturm Ruger (RGR)RGR stockSource: Ycharts.comIrrespective of personal opinions about the munitions industry, the overriding reality is that because of the Second Amendment, qualified law-abiding U.S. citizens and permanent residents may purchase firearms. Per the Washington Post, there are more guns than people in this country. And that makes firearms manufacturer Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) one of the must-watch charts ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.Given that the topic of self-defense and the right for individuals to bear arms represents much controversy, RGR inherently makes the ranks as a real-time economic and social indicator to monitor ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Still, it may be a contrarian indicator as well.Story continuesIf political circumstances bode well for Republicans, then arguably the primary incentive to acquire guns — the fear of restrictive gun control measures — will abate. Therefore, lower market valuations for RGR could imply a Republican surge. The opposite may hold true for a surprising run by Democrats.So far, RGR is down about 33% in the trailing year.Lockheed Martin (LMT)LMT stockClick to EnlargeSource: Ycharts.comFamed defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) represents one of the top charts to watch ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Still, LMT embodies ambiguities. Therefore, it may feature conflicting insights.Traditionally, Republicans present a pro-military and pro-defense profile. Thus, a rising LMT price may indicate growing support for Republicans in most other circumstances.These are not most other circumstances. Fundamentally, the Democrats led the charge against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even when going back into the archives, it appears Democrats have a stronger sense of global politics. For instance, then-Senator John F. Kennedy arguably presented a more cogent framework about geopolitics than former Vice President Richard Nixon.Given that the Biden administration continues to support Ukrainian resistance and independence, a rising LMT could be a positive indicator for the Democrats. Over the trailing year, shares are up almost 13%.NextEra Energy (NEE)NEE stockSource: Ycharts.comIn my opinion, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) unquestionably represents a must-watch chart ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Developing wind and solar energy infrastructures, NextEra provides the tangible platform for the climate change ideology. Scientists recognize that we humans must do something about the problem, and NEE is one cog in the solutions machinery.Should NEE shares rise, the perhaps obvious conclusion is that the narrative bolsters Democrats. To be fair, many conservative politicians also support environmentally sustainable policies. However, the left tends to attract the most attention for making climate change a top priority in its political agenda. Thus, a bullish NEE price chart could mean a positive outcome for Democrats.On the other hand, a declining NEE price chart could be an indicator that Republicans may enjoy a big day for the 2022 midterm elections. According to the Pew Research Center, while environmental concerns have risen between the two major political parties, the prioritization gap remains massive. In the trailing year, NEE has gained about 5%.Meta Platforms (META)META stockSource: Ycharts.comOwning the biggest social media network in Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of the charts to watch anyways. But ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, not many more pertinent stocks exist.Fundamentally, members across the political and ideological spectrum voiced concerns about Meta’s hegemony. As the Pew Research Center noted, a majority of U.S. adults believe that “their personal data is less secure now.” In addition, they feel that “data collection poses more risks than benefits.” In some ways, it’s not surprising that META collapsed this year.On the flipside, an argument rose to the forefront about Big Tech and social responsibility. For instance, deliberately disseminating misleading narratives may cause social harm. Ironically, the Columbia Journalism Review pointed out that in 1987, under President Ronald Reagan’s Federal Communications Commission, “the fairness doctrine was dropped, removing required balance from broadcast reporting.”It’s a difficult matter to decipher. However, in my view, a rising META price bodes well for Democrats. However, META is down 62% in the trailing year.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)GOOG stockSource: Ycharts.comFrankly, you can’t get more Big Tech than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Fundamentally, under the corporate umbrella’s Google machinery, Alphabet effectively owns the internet. Based on the latest data, Google maintains a 92% global market share for the search engine segment. Nothing else comes close.However, as with Meta above, privacy concerns became a major priority in recent years. According to another Pew report, half of Americans “have decided not to use a product or service because of privacy concerns.” Therefore, GOOG and GOOGL represent major challenges for both parties. Partially because of this, they also represent charts to watch ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.Fundamentally, many young people care about social justice. It is possible then that they may support censorship initiatives that mitigate potentially dangerous ideas. After all, for a tolerant society to succeed, it must not tolerate intolerance. Politically, I view rising GOOG and GOOGL prices as a positive for Democrats. Still, the fact on the ground for the trailing year is that GOOG is down 29%.Harley-Davidson (HOG)HOG stockSource: Ycharts.comJust mention the name Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) and certain images immediately come to mind. Because the company represents a niche segment, it’s a clear indicator for conservative ideologies.According to one data set, Harley-Davidson tends to attract predominantly males, aged 55 and above. Significantly, the company attempted to reach other demographics. Obviously, with the aforementioned rich diversity of the U.S., you can’t just feature a narrow focus. However, the company also struggled with expanding beyond its core consumer base.However, these struggles also make HOG a useful indicator for charts to watch ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Yes, Democrats ride motorcycles too. Still, as an average view, Harley leans toward conservative sentiments. Thus, a rising HOG price bodes well for Republicans. Currently, HOG runs 3.5% below parity in the trailing year.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

While these 70 projects won’t give investors an answer regarding The 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Now, it does reinforce why the agriculture industry is a smart bet for future growth.The 70 projects in this first funding pool include the following:Climate-Smart Agriculture Innovative Finance InitiativeScaling Methane Emissions Reductions and Soil Carbon SequestrationThe Soil Inventory Project Partnership for Impact and DemandThe Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities, andTraceable Reforestation for America’s Carbon and TimberAll 70 projects aim to help farmers, academics, agriculture-related companies, and government agencies work together to produce a more efficient, innovative, and climate-friendly industry. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe seven agriculture stocks to buy should all benefit from the investment the Biden Administration and the USDA are making in smart farming. While it will take years to assess the success of these projects, you can invest in these seven agriculture stocks today. ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$84.07CTVACorteva$58.27DEDeere &amp; Co.$342.55TSCOTractor Supply$192.45AGMFederal Agricultural Mortgage$102.46TSNTyson Foods$68.81SMGScotts Miracle-Gro$48.38Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)a picture of farmland during the daytimeSource: ShutterstockThe Des Moines Register reported in mid-September that Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) CEO Juan Luciano made $14.8 million by selling 284,531 shares of the world’s leading producer of human and animal nutrition company.At the time, Luciano exercised options between $33.18 and $40.65 on Sep. 9, netting an extra $2 million on his stock options because the ADM share price had fallen by 12% since. The sale was part of Luciano’s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. It’s not an indication that he knows something bad about the company. Instead, CEOs, like Luciano have financial obligations requiring them to sell shares for cash. Story continuesAs a company, Archer-Daniels-Midland continues to innovate for the future. On Aug. 17, for example, it announced it was collaborating with New Culture, a company that makes animal-free cheese products that look and feel like the real thing. The partnership gives New Culture the scale necessary to make an indent in the animal-free dairy products industry. Meanwhile, ADM gains access to one of the industry’s most innovative developers of animal-free dairy products. It doesn’t hurt that ADM generates a trailing 12-month operating income of $3.82 billion from $94.36 billion in revenue. ADM is a major player in agriculture. Corteva (CTVA)Closeup Of Small green Agricultural Toy Tractor loading money coins, Icon Farmer Machinery, Agriculture Business Concept (Harvest Finance)Source: Max_555 / Shutterstock.comAgriculture stocks are performing well in 2022. The iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF — listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as COW– is up nearly 2% year-to-date, almost 26% better than the S&amp;P 500. Not surprisingly, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) is up more than 22% YTD. In March 2021, I suggested Corteva was one of seven safe stocks that wouldn’t bleed your portfolio. I liked the stock because I believed Corteva would do well in 2021 and beyond. After all, agriculture is wise place to put your money. This was despite the threat from activist investor Starboard Value to shake things up. Starboard advocated for the dismissal of CEO Jim Collins in early 2021. While they didn’t get their wish, they did get three of their proposed independent board members added to Corteva’s board in March 2021 as part of the activist investor’s agreement with the company. All three are still on the board. Starboard continues to own more than one million shares of CTVA stock. Of the 25 analysts covering its stock, 17 rate it Buy or Overweight, with a median target price of $70, 22% higher than its current share price. Deere &amp; Co. (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comIn August 2019, I identified 10 companies using artificial intelligence (AI) to grow their businesses. Deere &amp; Co. (NYSE:DE) was one of the names on my list. “However, starting in 2013, Deere began to plot a vision of the future farm where all the machinery would be autonomously operated with the farmer monitoring everything from his home” I wrote. “Since then, it has evolved to include AI, computer vision, and machine learning. Agriculture is surprisingly well-suited to technology despite its low-tech reputation.”Using AI to save its customers money, Deere was betting farmers would buy newer equipment. Deere stock is up more than 128% since then.Many have a problem with John Deere’s dominance of the farm equipment market and how it got that way, but that’s a story for another day. There’s no denying the company’s size and scale. It is the largest farm equipment company in the world after all. In addition, it also sells more equipment globally than the next two largest competitors combined. It controls 53% of the U.S. market for large tractors and 60% of the U.S. combine market.Its TTM revenue through Q3 2023 is $47.93 billion, with an operating profit of $7.75 billion. That’s an operating margin of 16.2%. CNH Industrial’s (NYSE:CNHI) is 11.4%, 480 basis points lower. Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comI mentioned the iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF in the Corteva section. One of its top 10 holdings is Tennessee-based specialty retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), the largest retail farm and ranch store operator in the U.S. However, it targets recreational farmers, not the kind John Deere supplies.I first recommended TSCO for InvestorPlace in September 2014. It was one of 3 Great Stocks to Buy With No Debt and Great Prospects. It’s up 209% in the eight years since 2.5x the S&amp;P 500. Charlie Bilello recently pointed out that TSCO was the third best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock over the past 20 years, up 35,087%.While I don’t know if it can keep up such a blistering pace, it continues to deliver beneficial results. That is, even though, over those 20 years, there’s been at least four different CEOs and two recessions.The current CEO, Hal Lawton was hired away from Macy’s (NYSE:M) in December 2019. Since then, its shares have nearly doubled. In July, Tractor Supply reported Q2 2022 results that included a 5.5% increase in same-store sales and a 10.7% increase in earnings per share. In addition, it raised its 2022 outlook. On the top line, it now expects at least $13.95 billion in revenue, up from its previous guidance of $13.6 billion. On the bottom line, it now expects EPS of at least $9.48, 28 cents higher than its previous guidance.Down 20% YTD, it currently trades at 1.6x sales, right at its five-year average, so it’s not overpriced.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM)Man calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.Source: wutzkohphoto / ShutterstockAffectionately known as Farmer Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (NYSE:AGM) provides low-cost financing to agricultural lenders and those participating in agribusiness. A few highlights from its Q2 2022 presentation suggest it’s an excellent stock to own for the long haul. For example, more than 90% of its revenue is recurring, a figure tech companies would die for. On a cumulative basis, just 0.11% of its Agricultural Finance Mortgage Loans have soured. Lastly, its business continues to grow. Between 2000 and 2021, its outstanding business volume achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10%.Recurring revenue multiplied by rock-solid growth is a recipe for success. I guess that’s why AGM stock’s gained 3,200% since the March 2009 lows during the financial crisis.On page 7 of its presentation, Farmer Mac points out that it has just 6% of the farm sector real estate debt of $302 billion. The mortgage market is a big one, and it intends to keep gobbling up more of it in the years to come. In August, it reported its Q2 2022 results that included adding $1.9 billion of gross business volume ($236 million net growth), a 12% sequential increase in net interest income to $69.4 million, and a core EPS of $2.83, 19% higher sequentially and 2% year-over-year.Yielding 3.71%, get paid to wait for the stock’s next leg up. Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comThe processor of chicken, beef and pork has not done well by shareholders over the past five years. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) stock is down nearly 3%, more than 47 percentage points worse than the S&amp;P 500.So, why am I including TSN on my list? If nothing else, reversion to the mean suggests Tyson is due for a relief rally. Tyson recently made some organizational changes that will help the company grow. Included in the moves was the announcement that fourth-generation Tyson family member John R. Tyson is the company’s new Chief Financial Officer. Current CFO Stewart Glendinning moves over to Group President, Prepared Foods. The company hopes Glendinning’s financial and operational background will help its Prepared Foods business come into its own — they currently account for 18.1% of revenue and 17.4% of operating income — while John Tyson appears to be in the running to become CEO in the future.Analysts are lukewarm about its stock. Of the 15 covering it, 10 rate it a Hold. However, the average target price is $92.72, 35% higher than where it’s currently trading.Tyson expects 2022 revenues of $53 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. At an operating margin of 9%, it should generate $4.8 billion in operating income for the year.If you’re an income investor, it has an above-average yield of 2.7%, has grown the annual dividend for 10 consecutive years, and averaged a 17.2% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. It’s an excellent stock to own in turbulent times.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)A photo of various raw vegetables.Source: monticello/ShutterStock.comIf you bought Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) stock at the beginning of 2022, I feel your pain. It’s down more than 70% YTD, and there are still three months left of the year.I would put SMG on your watchlist if you’re an aggressive investor. It hasn’t traded this low since June 2013. If you bought back then and didn’t sell at its all-time high of $180.43 in April 2021, I feel your pain times two.The company’s shares lost 25% in August alone as margins crumbled as retailers reduced inventory levels.However, weighing more heavily on the share price could be the implosion of its Hawthorne Gardening business. Sales fell 63% in Q3 2022 to $154.5 million from $421.9 million a year earlier. Through the third quarter, Hawthorne’s sales were down 50% due to oversupply issues. As a result, it took a $632.4 million impairment charge on its goodwill and intangible assets.To counter the slide, the company announced Project Springboard when it released its third-quarter results in early August. It is intended to return Scotts Miracle-Gro to the level of profitability that shareholders have become accustomed to. Over the past five years, the company’s average gross margin was 32.1%. In Q3 2022, it was 19.9% and 27.5% YTD. It trades at o.67x sales, one-third of its five-year average. SMG is the value play of these seven agricultural stocks. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see some more stocks that made their way into the headlines this week, go directly to Why These 5 Stocks Trended This Week.It was another volatile week on Wall Street as the major indexes each fell around 3% this week. Due to the decline, the S&amp;P 500 has had the worst September since 2002.Friday's increase of 0.6% for the month of August in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, didn't help as the market expected an increase of 0.5%. With the Federal Reserve remaining focused on containing inflation, many investors think the central bank will continue to increase interest rates. Indeed, the 2 year Treasury yield, which is a reflection of the expectations for the federal funds rate, was 4.206%.If the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates, bonds could become more attractive and stocks could become less attractive.Amid the decline in the market, many tech stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trended.Other stocks, such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) also were in the limelight this week.Applebrandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 8% this week after Bloomberg reported that Apple is pulling back from a production increase for the iPhone 14 given that the expected demand might not be as strong as previously anticipated. Given the iPhone accounts for a substantial percentage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s profits, weaker demand could make it more difficult for the company to grow EPS. Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America also downgraded Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to 'Neutral' from 'Buy' and set a $160 price target, down from $185 this week.Story continues9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 258Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) declined by over 2% this week due to the broader market decline of around 3%. The stock also trended after Andrew Marok of Raymond James set an 'Outperform' rating and $300 price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), citing Microsoft's sustainable advantages in scale and deep relationships with many customers in enterprise. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are down around 31% year to date.8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 153Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) fell 3% this week, which was in-line with the decline of the major indexes such as the NASDAQ 100's 3% decline. Although TikTok could become a competitor to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s YouTube and search, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) still has a lot of advantages. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced it would shut down its Stadia streaming service this week.Lakehouse Capital mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in an investor letter in July 2022,Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported another strong quarterly result despite the tough macroeconomic conditions. Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube’s user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company’s overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency. Overall, we’re pleased with how the company has performed and are confident that management will be able to control costs, if or when the economic environment becomes more challenging.7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) fell 3.3% this week, slightly worse than the 3% decline in the NASDAQ. Investors remain concerned about TikTok's growth and some investors wonder if Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s metaverse investments will pay off. Although the market could be big, the metaverse will need a lot of investment in the beginning. Amid the market turmoil, Bloomberg reported that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is pausing hiring and planning to cut budgets across most teams.6. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell only 0.69% this week, versus the 3% decline in the NASDAQ. The company continues to benefit from positive analyst commentary. This week, Ronald Josey of Citi reiterated a 'Buy' rating and $185 price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), citing the company's refreshed device line-up that further advances Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s connected home vision. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares are down 32% year to date.Stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

According to a probability model by Ned Davis Research, there is currently a 98.1% chance of a recession globally. The only other time the probability model showed such results was during the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, according to a report by Bloomberg. This current economic downturn has made investors explore different investment strategies to cope with uncertainty.Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors because of their ability to generate regular income. Analysts around the world are recommending adding dividend stocks to portfolios to fight the current economic instability.Austin Graff, co-chief investment officer at Titleist Asset Management, gave a positive stance about dividend investing in his interview with CNN this September. He said that dividend-paying stocks perform well during inflation because these companies have sound fundamentals and strong balance sheets. He further said that investors should focus on dividend companies with solid histories of raising their dividends as these companies have stable free cash flow generation to support their dividends.According to a report published by ProShares, companies with proven track records of dividend growth have delivered better returns than the broader index. From April 2010 to March 2015, the S&amp;P 500 returned 14.47% while the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered a 16.83% return to shareholders. Some of the best dividend stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are favored by investors as these companies boast decades-long dividend growth streaks.

(NYSE:SGU) is an American provider of full-service energy and also specializes in the sales of home heating and air conditioning products to residential and commercial consumers.

One possible way to accomplish this goal is to follow a dividend growth investing strategy, buying stocks that pay an ever-increasing dividend each year and reinvesting the dividends. It’s a long-term approach, but start early enough, and the passive income stream snowballs.The most prominent of the dividend growth stocks are the dividend kings. They have increased their dividends for a minimum of 50 consecutive years. Many well-known dividend kings exist, like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). However, some companies are not as famous but still worth buying. Below we discuss five little-known dividend kings.CSVIComputer Sciences$56.24FMCBFarmers &amp; Merchants Bancorp$960.00NWNNorthwest Natural Holding Company$46.07TRTootsie Roll Industries$33.81SCLStepan Company$95.56InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsComputer Services (CSVI)Finger pointing at the word ""banking""Source: PopTika/ShutterStock.comComputer Services (OTCMKTS:CSVI) is one of the smaller and lesser-known dividend kings. The company only has a market capitalization of about $1.56 billion and was founded in 1965. Computer Services provides payment processing, digital banking, regulatory compliance and so on, to community and regional banks in the U.S. Total revenue was about $321 million in the past 12 months.Computer Services has a dividend yield of approximately 2%. The dividend has increased for 51 consecutive years, and the most recent quarterly increase of 7.4% to 29 cents per share was on July 21. A 51% payout ratio supports the dividend rate of $1.16 per share. This value is reasonable and ensures both dividend safety and future growth. Furthermore, the balance sheet has a net cash position adding to the dividend safety.Story continuesThe company was undervalued and had a 3%+ dividend yield until a recent acquisition announcement. The firm will be acquired for $58 per share in an all-cash transaction. The stock is trading at $56.24, so there is little upside now, but it may interest those who engage in merger arbitrage.Farmers &amp; Merchants Bancorp (FMCB)A customer makes a transaction at a bankSource: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.comFarmers &amp; Merchants Bancorp (OTCMKTS:FMCB) is another little-known dividend king with a market cap of roughly $740 million. The firm was founded in 1916. Today, it is a community bank offering personal and business banking in mid-Central California. The bank has about 29 branches. Total revenue was $171.3 million in the last 12 months.Farmers &amp; Merchants is paying a 1.64% dividend yield and is not a high-yield stock. But it has a 57-year streak of annual dividend increases that few other companies can match. The dividend safety is high, with a payout ratio of about 18%. Unlike most U.S. companies, the bank pays its dividend semi-annually.The stock has performed well in 2022 and is flat for the year. It is up about 6.6% in the past year. The trailing price-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 10X to 11X. The stock is slightly undervalued, assuming an earnings multiple of 12X, lower than the 10-year average. Investors seeking stability and dividend growth may be interested in this bank stock.Northwest Natural Holding Company (NWN)Several natural gas tanks with a sunrise in the backgroundSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockNorthwest Natural Holding Company (NYSE:NWN) is one of the smaller natural gas utilities. The company was founded in 1859. It has a market cap of $1.69 billion. Besides natural gas, Northwest Natural has a minor water and wastewater segment. The utility serves about 786,000 natural gas customers in Oregon and southwest Washington and roughly 80,000 water services customers in the Pacific Northwest and Texas. Total revenue was approximately $941 million in the past 12 months.The utility has a solid dividend yield of 3.9%, among the highest of the dividend kings. The firm has raised the dividend for an astounding 66 years giving it one of the longest active streaks. However, the growth rate is meager at 0.94% in the past decade and 0.53% in the trailing five years. As a utility, the payout ratio is on the higher end at roughly 75%.The stock has performed well during the bear market and is down about 1% in one-year and 6% year-to-date (YTD). The forward P/E ratio is about 19.8X, below the five-year range and at the lower end of the past 10 years. Although the dividend growth rate is low, investors are getting an undervalued stock with a nearly 4% dividend yield.Tootsie Roll Industries (TR)An image of a variety of candy.Source: Nataliia Pyzhova/ShutterStock.comTootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) is probably the most well-known company on this list because many of us have eaten its candy. However, investors tend to ignore the stock, and it is a little-known dividend king. The company produces and sells Tootsie Roll, Charms, Blow-Pops, Dots, Junior Mints, Sugar Daddy, Charleston Chew, Dubble Bubble and more. The Chairwoman and CEO, Ellen R. Gordon, owns approximately 53.9% of common stock and 82.8% of Class B shares, effectively giving her company control. Total revenue in the trailing 12 months was about $636.2 million.Tootsie Roll has a forward dividend yield of about 1% — not high. However, the company pays a 3% stock dividend that investors can sell, giving an effective yield of 4%. The company has a 56-year streak of dividend increases based on the increasing cash returned to investors. The earnings payout ratio is usually modest, ranging from 35% to 45%. Moreover, the company has a rock-solid balance sheet with a net cash position adding to the dividend safety.The candy manufacturer is rarely undervalued because of the limited float and family control. As a result, the stock usually trades at an elevated earnings multiple. The P/E ratio is now 35.7X within the five-year and 10-year range. The stock has performed well in 2022 and is down only about 3%, but it is up about 15% in the past year. Investors desiring a low-volatility stock with a 4% yield should look at Tootsie Roll.Stepan Company (SCL)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockStepan Company (NYSE:SCL) is the last stock on this list of little-known dividend kings. The company was founded in 1932. It produces and sells chemicals globally. It operates through three business segments: surfactants, polymers and specialty products. Total revenue was $2,639.6 million in the trailing 12 months.Stepan is not an income stock, with a dividend yield of only 1.3%. But this value is at the higher end of its range in the past decade. The company has increased the dividend for 54 years in a row and is currently doing so at about a 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. The earnings payout ratio is minimal at 20.3%, supporting future increases with excellent dividend safety. The balance sheet has relatively low leverage and high-interest coverage, adding to the dividend’s security.The valuation is low at a P/E ratio of about 15.1X, below the market average and less than the five-year and 10-year averages. The stock price is down about 24% YTD because investors fear a recession will trigger lower demand for chemicals. Despite the low dividend yield, the good dividend safety, high dividend growth rate and low valuation make Stepan an excellent stock to consider for total return.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. The author is not a licensed or registered investment adviser or broker/dealer.

39,fbff6a3d-a32a-31de-8483-54bc81975213,CCI,2022-10-02,The total return for Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-crown-castle-nyse-140043514.html,1664632843,STORY,['CCI'],"[While Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 16% in the last quarter. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 42%, less than the market return of 50%.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 5.9%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Crown Castle managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free interactive report on Crown Castle's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Crown Castle's TSR for the last 5 years was 69%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Crown Castle shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 14% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Crown Castle that you should be aware of before investing here.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Insiders invest with the hopes of seeing their money grow in value over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$664k, which is not what they expected.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$121). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.1m for 5.48k shares. But insiders sold 990.00 shares worth US$220k. Overall, Boeing insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Boeing insiders own about US$51m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Boeing insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Boeing has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But if it's as good as the others then why not,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the United Nation's aviation agency's triennial assembly in Montreal, Canada.On Friday, China hailed the development of its first medium-haul passenger jet as the embodiment of the country's drive towards self-sufficiency, with safety approval awarded to a plane that aims to challenge Western aircraft giants for orders.The first C919 aircraft, designed to compete with popular single-aisle models made by Airbus and Boeing, will be delivered by the end of the year, state Xinhua News Agency said.It remains unclear when the plane might be certified by the United States or Europe, opening the way to sales in most foreign markets, but industry analysts say it will be up to a decade before China can seriously tackle the existing Boeing-Airbus duopoly.""China and Nigeria (have a) very cordial and friendly relationship with mutual benefits,"" Sirika said.For decades, China has loaned billions of dollars to Africa to build railroads, power plants and highways as it deepened ties with the continent while extracting minerals and oil.Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is the top importer of Chinese goods, hoovering up $23 billion worth in 2021.Nigeria's poor transport and power networks have stymied economic growth for decades, holding back the distribution of wealth in Africa's biggest economy where 40% of people live below the national poverty line.However, the country is growing its aviation sector, where traffic is now above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, Sirika said. The airline is one of President Muhammadu Buhari's 2015 election campaign promises.(Reporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

See our latest analysis for Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SouthernOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, for US$506k worth of shares, at about US$67.47 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$68.00, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 29% of Ann Daiss's holding.In the last year Southern insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Southern better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Southern insiders own about US$171m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Southern Insiders?The fact that there have been no Southern insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Southern insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Southern has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see some more stocks that made their way into the headlines this week, go directly to Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.The markets remained volatile this week as the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ each fell by around 3%. Despite the more attractive valuations, the markets likely fell this week due to continued concern that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to fight inflation.The Federal Reserve has already increased the interest rate by 5 times this year and there could be even further increases with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic saying, ""The lack of progress thus far has me thinking much more now that we have to get to a moderately restrictive stance. And for me, that is in the 4.25% to 4.5% range for our policy. My preference is that we get there by year end.""If interest rates continue to go up, the economy could slow as borrowing costs increase.Amid the market decline, several stocks such as NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) were in the spotlight this week for various reasons. Furthermore other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended.7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexels10. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) fell over 14% this week with much of the drop occurring after the clothing giant reported rising inventories and lower margins for Q1. For the period, Nike's inventories rose 44% year over year and its gross margins fell 220 basis points. Furthermore, the company expects FY23 gross margins to decline by 200 to 250 basis points for FY2023. Given the challenges, Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital cut his price target on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to $110 from $128 but kept an 'Outperform' rating. Siegel still likes NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in the long term given the company's scale and other competitive advantages.Story continues9. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) declined over 21% this week given the company reported Q3 EPS of -$0.65 versus the consensus of -$0.13. Sales for the company were $4.31 billion, versus the consensus of $5.07 billion. Q4 might not be as great as the company also said its Q4 cumulative advance bookings were 'below the historical range'. Given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s debt, the stock could be very volatile depending on how demand changes. If future bookings are weaker, demand for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) could not be as high as expected.8. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) fell 14.7% this week given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s Q3 results and advance bookings commentary. Given that they are in the same sector, demand for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) could be affected by the same factors as Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL). If advance bookings is weaker for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), they might not be as strong for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL).7. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) fell over 16% this week with much of the drop likely due to the Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) news. Since they are in the same sector, demand for cruises from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as strong if demand for cruises for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) are weaker than expected. If demand isn't as strong, the earnings results of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as great. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) are down 45% year to date.6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declined by 4.8% this week due to the broader market decline of 3%. Although Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) can potentially earn more money if interest rates go higher, the bank could also lose money if the economy slows too much. If that happens, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) write-offs might increase. Shares of the stock are down 32% year to date.Some other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended this week.Click to continue reading and see Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.Suggested articles:10 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire George Soros10 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire Bill GatesWarren Buffett’s 10 Favorite Dividend Stocks for the Rest of 2022Disclosure: None.

49,97e8ed98-62b9-37d6-b035-2c0db3d15330,IBM,2022-10-02,"In the wake of International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) latest US$3.5b market cap drop, institutional owners may be forced to take severe actions",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wake-international-business-machines-corporations-140049858.html,1664632849,STORY,['IBM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 57% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$3.5b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 8.8% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in International Business Machines' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.International Business Machines already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in International Business Machines. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.7% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that International Business Machines Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$137m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 43% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for International Business Machines   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

50,0f9c9f9f-b9ef-352a-a28a-8b5a943fb0bc,TAP,2022-10-02,7 Under-$50 Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-under-50-sleeper-stocks-194101558.html,1664394061,STORY,"['TAP-A', 'MRO', 'ALLY', 'GM', 'LEU', 'PPC', 'SUN']","[After covering market ideas under $10 and later under $20, it’s now time to go up the standalone denomination chain of the Federal Reserve note spectrum and discuss under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy before Wall Street wakes up. The narrative is simple. Your boss likes your work and decides to give you a raise. With half a Benjamin in your hand, your breadth of choices just expanded significantly.Still, it’s a troubled market out there. With the Federal Reserve recently raising the benchmark interest rate to combat inflation, deflationary forces now impact the market. Left to extend to its extremes, deflation could create a passive incentive to do nothing. The purchasing power of the dollar rises, automatically creating positive returns for the apathetic. Admittedly, that’s not a great backdrop for under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.Nevertheless, these market ideas feature a relevant business profile that Wall Street doesn’t seem to be appreciating. You could take advantage of this lack of trust and perhaps foresight, provided you can accept the risks. If so, below are seven under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsALLYAlly Financial$28.10MROMarathon Oil$22.67SUNSunco$38.60PPCPilgrim’s Pride$23.73LEUCentrus Energy$43.12GMGeneral Motors$35.35TAPMolson Coors$48.29Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comA bank holding company, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) provides a range of services, including car financing, online banking, corporate lending and mortgage loans. It even has an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets, a feature that undoubtedly came in handy during the heyday of the post-pandemic new normal.At the time of writing, Ally Financial printed a price tag of $28.10. The company has a market capitalization of $8.67 billion. Since the start of this year, ALLY lost 38% of its value in the equities sector. It’s not difficult to understand why given the Fed’s deflationary pivot.Story continuesFundamentally, though, a deflationary cycle may inspire greater demand for Ally’s wealth management arm. When the purchasing power of the dollar rises, an investment opportunity must be so compelling that someone will be willing to set aside free positive returns. Ally’s professional financial advisors — as opposed to YouTube gurus — can help navigate clients to upside success.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com considers ALLY significantly undervalued. Ally features a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 3.9 times, well below the industry median rating of 8 times.Marathon Oil (MRO)marathon oil (MRO stock) logo on a screenSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAn American company concentrating on hydrocarbon exploration, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) benefitted handsomely from the energy security paradigm of 2022. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine setting off sanctions and retaliatory responses, the end result appears to be the Kremlin cutting off critical commodities to Western nations. Thus, MRO could swing higher.Because of the high profile of Marathon, it’s not broadly considered an under-$50 sleeper stock. At the time of writing, MRO sits at $22.67 in the open market, gaining 6% for the day. Since the start of the year, MRO has gained nearly 38%. However, in the trailing month, shares have plunged 13%. Thus, Marathon is a sleeper in that stakeholders seem to be rushing to the exits recently.Fundamentally, the deflationary forces at work pose problems for commodities. However, with Russia’s partial military mobilization, it appears Moscow committed the nation to the bitter end. That should cynically be net positive for MRO based on implied lower energy inventory levels.Sunoco (SUN)Ecology, alternative sustainable energy and environment protection saving business concept, GEVOSource: Oleksiy Mark / Shutterstock.comA master limited partnership, Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) specializes in fuel distribution. Technically, this concept aligns with the downstream component of the hydrocarbon industry. In contrast, a company like Marathon Oil above focuses on the upstream side of the energy sector.Presently, Sunoco features a price tag of $38.60. It also has a market cap of $3.2 billion. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, SUN has slipped a bit below 5%. Relatively speaking, that’s not bad at all considering the crimson ink in the major equity indices.However, in the trailing month, SUN fell nearly 7%. Nevertheless, the combination of its underlying relevance and diminished market performance suggests that Sunoco is one of the best under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.Fundamentally, the downstream component presents much intrigue because of baseline inelastic demand. While fuel consumption behaviors change based on economic conditions, the baseline demand — or the consumption necessary to travel for essential purposes — remains largely the same. Thus, if you don’t mind the extra paperwork associated with MLPs, SUN could be an intriguing opportunity.Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC)Source: ShutterstockAn American multinational food company, Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) represents one of the largest chicken producers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As well, it’s the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. Given the necessity of food to humans, Pilgrim’s Pride offers a cynical idea for under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, PPC stock commands a price of $23.73. The company has a market value of $5.88 billion. Although Pilgrim’s Pride features an indelible business narrative, its stock has fallen nearly 17% so far this year. In the trailing month, PPC has shed almost 20% of equity value.While a risky idea, I’m going to borrow from Mr. InvestorPlace himself, Louis Navellier. “The poultry and pork products processor is profiting handsomely from rising meat prices that are stinging consumers’ pocketbooks. The company says it expects to earn $3.31 per share in earnings in 2022, up from 13 cents EPS in 2021 and 39 cents EPS in 2020.”Centrus Energy (LEU)clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in BelgiumSource: engel.ac / ShutterstockA nuclear fuel company, Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT:LEU) supplies nuclear fuel for use in nuclear power plants. It also works to develop and deploy advanced centrifuge technology to produce enriched uranium for commercial and government uses. Naturally, Centrus plays a critical role in national security.As of this writing, LEU stock has a price tag of $43.12. It’s one of the smaller companies on this list of under-$50 sleeper stocks, featuring a market cap of $624.7 million. While LEU has so far popped up 8% today, it’s down over 14% YTD. Nevertheless, contrarians will want to put Centrus on their radar.Politically, we can talk all day about renewable this and sustainable that. Scientifically, though, nuclear energy will likely always play a vital role in domestic and perhaps global energy profiles. No other commodity features the incredible energy density of nuclear fuel. One uranium fuel pellet, for instance, commands the same energy potential as 149 gallons of crude oil.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOne of the most iconic American companies, General Motors (NYSE:GM) represents the largest automaker in the U.S. Of course, this status hasn’t always yielded success, especially this year due to myriad economic headwinds. However, contrarians may want to consider this intriguing entry among under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, GM stock found itself priced at $35.35. Currently, the underlying automaker features a market cap of $51.5 billion. Since the start of the year, GM has hemorrhaged nearly 40% of equity value. Nevertheless, despite the crimson tide, the future appears bright for the company.Essentially, GM perfectly balances initiatives geared toward electric vehicles (EVs) and combustion cars. As you may have seen, GM advertised several upcoming EV models, including the electric-powered Hummer. On the combustion side, the automaker introduced the eighth-generation mid-engine Corvette. Sales for the Corvette remain impressive.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comA multinational drink and brewing company, Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) brings people together through imbibing strong beverages. You can tell that it’s not your typical offering, because Molson Coors’ website is age restricted. Moving forward, cynical undertones associated with this business may lift TAP as one of the under-$50 sleeper stocks to buy.At the time of writing, TAP barely qualifies for this list. It prints a price of $48.29. Currently, the company has a market cap of $10.5 billion. Notably, TAP outperformed several publicly traded companies so far this year, gaining half-a-percent above parity. Still, over the trailing month, shares have dipped 10%, suggesting some lack of appreciation here.Fundamentally, if the economy slips into a recession, demand for Molson Coors may rise. Two elements would possibly be at play. First, American consumers historically spend money for escapism purposes during hard times. Second, no offense to any Molson Coors fans, but most of the underlying products aren’t exactly a bottle of Louis XIII de Rémy Martin, you know what I mean?Thus, TAP could be an ideal play among under-$50 sleeper stocks if you anticipate a downturn.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

51,130c2308-6a33-418d-ba79-d879a089671b,UAL,2022-10-02,Mesa Airlines' new training program can help 'break the pipeline' of pilot shortage: CEO,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mesa-airlines-new-training-program-can-help-break-the-pipeline-of-pilot-shortage-ceo-202824502.html,1664656104,STORY,"['AAL', 'UAL', 'DAL']","[The so-called “summer of travel hell” is behind us, but the ongoing national pilot shortage is still causing plenty of headwinds for the industry.Estimates vary, but one government estimate projects a shortfall of 18,000-plus pilots each year for the next decade.Mesa Airlines, a regional airline that flies for both United and American as well as cargo carrier DHL Express, says his company has a solution.CEO Jonathan Ornstein told Yahoo Finance his company is rolling out a program to provide would-be pilots with interest-free loans to help them accumulate the required number of in-air training miles to fly commercially in the United States.“What we've done is we just made an order for up to 104 smaller, light training aircraft, where we're effectively going to give people the opportunity to fly those aircraft, finance it completely. They don't pay us any money until they come to work. And the basic price, $25 an hour, is about literally 1/6 of what it would cost them to do it on their own. So it's just a terrific opportunity for new aspiring aviators to get into commercial aviation, which has now never been more lucrative,” Ornstein said.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The response from eager pilots has been overwhelmingly positive, with nearly 70 new signups in one day, Ornstein said. “There are 25,000 or more folks out there who want to fly in commercial aviation but cannot build the time quickly enough.”Ornstein said the company plans to hire everyone that completes the program, with starting wages at $100 an hour. “These people coming into the industry now, make probably close to $100,000 a year in their first year coming to work at Mesa.”In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) required commercial pilots to have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight training time, an increase from 250 hours. Republic Airways recently challenged this rule unsuccessfully, with the FAA citing safety concerns for shorter training periods.Ornstein says the FAA’s rules are exacerbating the pilot shortage. He pointed out the that European Union requires pilots acquire just 250 hours of training.“It’s kind of incredible that a big wide body aircraft flown by Air France or Lufthansa can fly into JFK with a pilot who has 400 hours and yet an American pilot is not deemed as capable somehow to fly a regional jet into Des Moines.”Story continuesIn recent months United, American, and Delta have cited the pilot shortage as a reason for cutting regional service to smaller cities such as Iowa’s Des Moines and Dubuque, New York’s Ithaca and Islip, and Ohio’s Toledo. Ornstein predicts the trend will continue. “We’re talking about the evaporation of the regional industry if we don’t do something quickly and I think the impact on the traveling public could be very, very significant.”The pilot shortage can be seen from coast to coast in reduced schedules and increased delays, cancellations and, of course, rising ticket prices. “The ultimate loser is the consumer,” said Ornstein. “Airline prices are up almost 35% year-over-year, service in 70% of all cities has declined and believe me, this is all due to the fact that we just don’t have enough people to fly aircraft.”The interest-free loan program launches in Florida next month, with Arizona to follow suit.

53,e35ca4a6-636f-3481-8c35-d9a2b5a8c8cf,TGT,2022-10-02,7 Consumer Stocks to Sell Before They Die,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-stocks-sell-die-191650744.html,1664392610,STORY,"['WBA', 'GPS', 'AEO', 'KHC', 'TGT', 'UL', 'M']","[This year, consumer stocks have been hammered as inflation lingers at 40-year highs and interest rates rise. The Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index is down 20% this year as consumers pull back on their spending. However, some consumer-focused companies have performed worse than others. Much worse. Whether it is due to poor management, failure to adapt to a changing marketplace, or doomed deals, some consumer-oriented stocks have suffered 50% or more declines through the first nine months of the year. Many companies are clearly in jeopardy, and analysts question their long-term viability. Thus, investors would be best advised to avoid such companies in danger. With that in mind, here are the following seven consumer stocks to sell:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$153.25GPSGap Inc$8.69ULUnilever$43.67AEOAmerican Eagle Outfitters$10.46MMacy’s$16.49WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$32.59KHCKraft Heinz$33.34Target (TGT)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt may not die, but consumer retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sure hasn’t been the same coming out of the pandemic. The company has spent most of this year selling off excess inventory at deeply discounted prices as it adjusts to slowing consumer demand. The result has been that the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company has lowered its forward guidance twice this year, and its quarterly profit declined nearly 90% in the three months ended July 30. The turmoil has weighed heavily on TGT stock, down 36% on the year and trading at just over $150 a share.While some shareholders have called for new management, it was announced earlier in September that Target’s CEO Brian Cornell will remain in his position for three more years after Target did away with its mandatory retirement age of 65. Of course, Target may get its inventory back down to manageable levels. However, it is still grappling with inflationary pressures, slowing consumer spending, and ongoing supply chain constraints, likely to continue lowering its share price in the coming months. Thus, I believe Target is one of the top consumer stocks to sell.Story continuesGap Inc (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockIt’s been an equally ugly year for clothing retailer Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The San Francisco-based company has seen its stock price fall 65% in the last 12 months, including a 53% decline this year. GPS stock now trades at $8.69 and continues to slump. The most recent news out of the company is that it is laying off 500 employees, equal to about 5% of its 8,700 global workers. The job cuts come amid mounting losses and turmoil at the company’s upper echelons.In July, Gap announced that CEO Sonia Syngal was stepping down immediately after less than three years in the position. This is as sales continue to weaken across the board at Gap Inc and its other retail chain Old Navy. Even singer Kanye West has abandoned the Gap brand, announcing recently that he is terminating early his two-year promotional deal with Gap, citing “substantial noncompliance” with the terms of the contract. Et Tu Kanye?Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comGiven that it’s the largest maker of soap in the world, among many other consumer products, one would assume that shares of Unilever (NYSE:UL) would be pretty resilient to this year’s market downturn. But it is not. Unfortunately, UL stock is down 19% year to date and trading at $43.67 a share. This is even though Unilever makes many of the most beloved and essential consumer products worldwide, ranging from Dove soap to Sunlight laundry detergent and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream.The deflated share price comes as consumer spending rolls over and also as Unilever’s CEO prepares to exit the company. Also, Unilever is grappling with famed activist investor Nelson Peltz, who now has a seat on the company’s board of directors. Unilever CEO Alan Jope announced his plans to retire following a failed attempt to buy the consumer healthcare business of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). For his part, Peltz wants Unilever to become a leaner, more nimble company. Shortly after Peltz joined the board, Unilever announced plans to cut 1,500 management jobs and reshape its business.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)Source: ShutterstockLike Gap, clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) has had a bruising year. Since January, AEO stock has fallen 60% to trade at $10.46 a share. The Pittsburgh-based company is struggling with all the same challenges as the other companies on this list. Inflation, declining consumer spending, and supply constraints have hurt American Eagle Outfitters’ earnings. The company’s most recent financial results showed that its inventory levels rose 36.3%, even though its gross margins fell to 30.9% from 44.3%.Consequently, American Eagle Outfitters has been forced to deeply discount its clothing merchandise to sell and reduce its inventory levels. All the discounting led American Eagle Outfitters to report a second-quarter earnings-per-share (or EPS) profit of 4 cents, which was well below the 60 cents a share expected on Wall Street. The company also announced that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, which yielded a hefty 6.2%. The canceled dividend payment sent many shareholders rushing for the exits, making it one of they key consumer stocks to sell.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comIt seems like a long time ago now that department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) was thriving during the pandemic. But this year, M stock has plummeted 42% to change hands at $16.49 per share. The stock is far from its all-time high of $70 a share in 2015. While the company has traditionally thrived during the year-end holiday shopping season, Macy’s seemed to acknowledge that it doesn’t anticipate robust consumer spending this year, announcing that it plans to hire 41,000 seasonal workers for the holidays this year, 46% of the 76,000-holiday staff hired in 2021.Macy’s has been trying its best to navigate these uncertain times by enhancing its digital/online sales channels. But here, too, Macy’s has struggled. In its most recent quarter, the company announced that its digital sales declined 5% yearly. The company has announced a three-year plan to turn around its fortunes, which it calls “Polaris.” However, the plan seems to have underwhelmed analysts who cover the company. Macy’s most recently lowered its forward guidance and says it now expects fiscal 2022 revenue from $24.34 billion to $24.58 billion, down from previous forecasts of $24.46 billion to $24.7 billion. Thus, making it one of the consumer stocks to sell.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also did well during the pandemic when its more than 8,900 drugstores sprinkled across all 50 states dispensed Covid-19 vaccinations. But this year has been another story.Through nearly nine months of 2022, WBA stock is down 38% at around $32.59 a share. The stock has been deep-sixed since Walgreens announced plans to spend $5.2 billion to acquire the primary care company VillageMD last year.The plan is to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations within Walgreens outlets by 2027. The primary care locations will provide medical services to customers of Walgreens, combining direct medical treatments and pharmaceutical medicines under one roof. While that might sound good on paper, investors appear to be concerned with the hefty amount invested in VillageMD and a slowdown in consumer foot traffic at Walgreen locations coming out of the pandemic. Therefore, it will be a while before the VillageMD plan shows any results.Kraft Heinz (KHC)Heinz (KHC) ketchup bottle about to squeeze out ketchupSource: SSokolov / Shutterstock.comYou know it’s bad when legendary investor Warren Buffett says he regrets buying a stock. While the Oracle of Omaha still owns nearly $11 billion worth of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock, it is undoubtedly one of his worst investments. Over the past five years, KHC stock has fallen more than 60% to trade at $33.34 per share. Over the last ten years, the stock has declined 27%, leading many analysts to refer to Kraft Heinz as a value trap.The food company that makes everything from ketchup to cream cheese and owns popular brands such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs has seen its share price deflate since Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged in 2015 at a price tag of $49 billion, creating the third-largest food company in North America.While the merger, with its promised synergies and competitive advantages, lured many investors, including Buffett, those benefits have never really materialized. And that’s led to KHC stock steadily eroding over the past seven years, making it one of the top consumer stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

If you want to see some more stocks that made their way into the headlines this week, go directly to Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.The markets remained volatile this week as the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ each fell by around 3%. Despite the more attractive valuations, the markets likely fell this week due to continued concern that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to fight inflation.The Federal Reserve has already increased the interest rate by 5 times this year and there could be even further increases with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic saying, ""The lack of progress thus far has me thinking much more now that we have to get to a moderately restrictive stance. And for me, that is in the 4.25% to 4.5% range for our policy. My preference is that we get there by year end.""If interest rates continue to go up, the economy could slow as borrowing costs increase.Amid the market decline, several stocks such as NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) were in the spotlight this week for various reasons. Furthermore other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended.7 Stocks to Buy According to Eduardo Costa's Calixto Global InvestorsSource: pexels10. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) fell over 14% this week with much of the drop occurring after the clothing giant reported rising inventories and lower margins for Q1. For the period, Nike's inventories rose 44% year over year and its gross margins fell 220 basis points. Furthermore, the company expects FY23 gross margins to decline by 200 to 250 basis points for FY2023. Given the challenges, Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital cut his price target on NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) to $110 from $128 but kept an 'Outperform' rating. Siegel still likes NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in the long term given the company's scale and other competitive advantages.Story continues9. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) declined over 21% this week given the company reported Q3 EPS of -$0.65 versus the consensus of -$0.13. Sales for the company were $4.31 billion, versus the consensus of $5.07 billion. Q4 might not be as great as the company also said its Q4 cumulative advance bookings were 'below the historical range'. Given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s debt, the stock could be very volatile depending on how demand changes. If future bookings are weaker, demand for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) could not be as high as expected.8. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) fell 14.7% this week given Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)'s Q3 results and advance bookings commentary. Given that they are in the same sector, demand for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) could be affected by the same factors as Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL). If advance bookings is weaker for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), they might not be as strong for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL).7. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) fell over 16% this week with much of the drop likely due to the Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) news. Since they are in the same sector, demand for cruises from Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as strong if demand for cruises for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) are weaker than expected. If demand isn't as strong, the earnings results of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) might not be as great. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH) are down 45% year to date.6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declined by 4.8% this week due to the broader market decline of 3%. Although Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) can potentially earn more money if interest rates go higher, the bank could also lose money if the economy slows too much. If that happens, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) write-offs might increase. Shares of the stock are down 32% year to date.Some other stocks such as Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also trended this week.Click to continue reading and see Why These 5 Stocks Were in the Spotlight This Week.Suggested articles:10 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire George Soros10 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaire Bill GatesWarren Buffett’s 10 Favorite Dividend Stocks for the Rest of 2022Disclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:ADI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-analog-devices-inc-110116512.html,1664708476,STORY,['ADI'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$180 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$139. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Analog Devices' current trading price of US$139 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Analog Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices What Is Analog Devices Worth?Analog Devices appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Analog Devices’s ratio of 37.96x is above its peer average of 15.46x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Analog Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Analog Devices?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Analog Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 97%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ADI should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ADI, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Analog Devices, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$13b after the stock price dropped 3.4% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, James Hoffmeister, for US$402k worth of shares, at about US$231 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$178. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Visa insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Visa insiders own about US$183m worth of shares (which is 0.05% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Visa Insiders?The fact that there have been no Visa insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us.

Verizon acquired an average of approximately 161 MHz of C-band spectrum in markets across the country, providing a huge superhighway for wireless data to travel on. Floridians starting the long road to recovery as well as countless emergency workers and volunteers coming into the markets from across the US will need this extra bandwidth and speed. 5G Ultra Wideband is ideally designed to provide additional wireless speed and capacity for situations like this.Additional and ongoing recovery effortsVerizon engineers have been on the ground since before the storm readying teams who have leapt into action to provide wireless connectivity in the state in the wake of the storm. Verizon is in close contact with federal, state and local emergency management teams and is coordinating communication needs and efforts with them.  Verizon engineers are partnering directly with the state and local Emergency Operations Centers on restoration priorities and community needs.Massive ongoing refueling operations are underway to ensure our permanent and portable generators remain in service until commercial power can be restored. Verizon engineers have moved temporary assets such as mobile cell sites connected with satellite links and fueled with portable generators to provide coverage to local and state forward command centers, search and rescue teams, power restoral staging areas and other first responders.Story continuesOn Sanibel Island, which was separated from the mainland when the bridge collapsed during Hurricane Ian, Verizon has launched a tethered drone outfitted with a cellular node (a flying cell site) that is providing cellular coverage from the air to support search and rescue teams and first responders on the ground.  The drone provides coverage for an approximate 5-7 mile radius and can fly for up to 1,000 hours.Additional recovery efforts can be seen on the Verizon Response to Hurricane Ian page which will continue to be updated regularly throughout this event.Verizon Communications Inc.

60,4195bf2e-9bf5-34ca-8586-8823ee9564a7,VZ,2022-10-02,Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE:VZ) Low P/E No Reason For Excitement,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-130033030.html,1664629233,STORY,['VZ'],"[When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or ""P/E's"") above 14x, you may consider Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) as an attractive investment with its 7.7x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Verizon Communications has been relatively sluggish. The P/E is probably low because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Verizon Communications will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Any Growth For Verizon Communications?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Verizon Communications would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 3.1% last year. EPS has also lifted 29% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 3.1% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Verizon Communications' P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.The Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Verizon Communications maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.You should always think about risks.

At the time of this writing, Walt Disney is hovering around $97 per share, far below its $157 price at the start of 2022. Indeed, at the beginning of the year, Walt Disney was outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a few points.Continue reading]"
62,f4a5b58b-ffd1-30c0-9331-0eee1ffeabd3,DIS,2022-10-02,What Does The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-walt-disney-companys-nyse-120130101.html,1664712090,STORY,['DIS'],"[Let's talk about the popular The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$125 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$91.84. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$94.33 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney What's The Opportunity In Walt Disney?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Walt Disney’s ratio of 53.89x is above its peer average of 19.99x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Entertainment industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Walt Disney?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in DIS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe DIS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for DIS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

(NYSE:URI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-united-rentals-120717888.html,1664712437,STORY,['URI'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Rentals’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals What Is United Rentals Worth?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 10.8x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 10.99x, which means if you buy United Rentals today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe United Rentals should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that United Rentals’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of United Rentals look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. United Rentals' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 28%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? URI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at URI? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on URI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for URI, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$11b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 2.9% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell McDonald's which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that McDonald's does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McDonald's Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$160m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with McDonald's .If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. Unfortunately its return of 47% is below the market return of 50%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 22% drop, in the last year.While the stock has fallen 3.8% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for American Express To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, American Express achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American Express has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 5 years was 58%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 22% received by American Express shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -22%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 10% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with American Express , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) sold US$12m worth of stock at an average price of US$63.66 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. After the stock price dropped 7.0% last week, the company's market value declined by US$5.6b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Fredric Reynolds, sold US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$54.83). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, Mondelez International insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Mondelez International insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$90m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Mondelez International Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Mondelez International insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at Mondelez International in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Mondelez International and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The perfect drip coffee makersThe Moccamaster and Black &amp; Decker not only look great but brew a mean cup of coffee.If we can say one thing about coffee makers, it's to never underestimate the power of drip coffee. There are thousands of brewers available on the market, which can make it tough to narrow down your choices. But don't worry—we've tested the most popular full-size drip brewers to find the best one. The results: The Technivorm Moccamaster KBG reigned supreme for its fast brewing speed, well-made design and ability to brew smooth coffee. While it's on the pricier side, it brews a complex pot of coffee, enough to serve multiple people (or refill your mug multiple times), giving you quality coffee for your morning commute or afternoon pick-me-up.Story continuesFor something a little more budget-friendly, we love the Black &amp; Decker 12-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker. It makes brew-tifully smooth and flavorful coffee and is very simple to use. This coffee maker even outperformed some of the high-end brands we tested it against, proving to be an affordable staple for the kitchen.$329 at Amazon $83.72 at Amazon2. The best bean roasterUse this bean roaster to get your beans as dark as you like.Roasting coffee beans yourself can help you make the perfect brew by ensuring that your beans are as dark as you want. Based on thorough market research, we determined that the Nuvo Eco Ceramic Handy Coffee Roaster is the best roaster you can buy online. The Nuvo Eco combines form with function, as the beautiful ceramic roaster efficiently heats up to 70 coffee beans at once. The eco-friendly material can get very hot, but thanks to the heat-blocking handle, you'll be protected from nasty burns.$30 at Amazon3. Our favorite coffee grindersThe Baratza and Krups coffee grinders feature everything you need to make delicious, freshly ground coffee.While the convenience of pre-ground coffee surely can't be beaten, there's a reason coffee aficionados prefer to grind their own beans right before brewing. Soon after coffee beans are exposed to air, the beans and their flavor begin to dissipate, even if the coffee comes in a vacuum-sealed bag.That's why buying a good coffee grinder is key for the perfect cup. Out of all the coffee grinders we've tested, the Baratza Encore gave us perfect beans both for a fine grind for an espresso machine and a coarse grind for a French press. The machine is durable and simple to use. Plus, it features 40-grind settings to choose from, making it a pick above the rest.While a blade grinder can't produce as much coffee grinds at once, they don't overheat beans and they provide a very even grind. We prefer the Krups Fast Touch Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder when it comes to blade grinders. It's easy to use, doubles as a spice grinder and is a lot easier on the wallet than most coffee grinders.$170 at Amazon$22 at Target4. Our favorite Nespresso machinesNespresso machines are quick and user-friendly, making mornings that much easier.If convenience is key for you, pod-operated coffee makers can be a life-saver. And if you don't want to skimp on quality, Nespresso machines have found a way to beautifully combine convenience and high-quality coffee.We've tested a wide array of Nespresso machines and found the Nespresso VertuoPlus by Breville machine to be our favorite single-serve coffee maker. This compact machine packs a punch, offering fast brewing and plenty of coffee options from regular coffee to double espresso drinks.For a more affordable single-serve machine, the Nespresso Lattisima Plus by De'Longhi is an all-in-one coffee maker that allows you to make quality espresso shots, lattes or cappuccinos with just a touch of the button. The machine itself is very easy to clean, with some of the parts being dishwasher-friendly.$157.24 at Amazon$320 at Amazon5. Our favorite coffee percolatorIf you like your coffee dark, you need a percolator.While nothing beats the convenience of drip makers or pod machines such as Keurig, there are instances when the seasoned coffee percolator outshines its automated brethren. If you fancy your coffee dark and strong, you can't go wrong by using a percolator. A percolator is especially helpful if you’re looking to make a large brew as they typically boast larger capacities.  After extensive testing, we found the best coffee percolator to be the Maxi-Matic Elite Platinum EC-120 12 Cup Percolator. It offers modern safety features, can be lifted off of the heating element for easy serving and, most importantly, makes flavorful, delicious coffee (up to 12 cups at once!).$48 at Amazon6. An affordable yet high-performing milk frotherOur top-tested milk frother, the Instant Milk Frother, is perfect for any budget.Frothy, foamy milk—it's necessary for making the perfect latte or cappuccino. We've tested several milk frothers available on the market and found the Instant Milk Frother to be the best option out there at a surprising $30 sticker price. This milk frother that is made by the same brand that gave us the Instant Pot easily creates foam no matter what temperature or type of milk (such as almond or oat milk) that you use.$38 at Amazon7. A coffee subscription to help you discover new beansIf you're looking for new coffee to drink, you should try a coffee subscription service.If you're a self-described coffee snob, then you're probably always looking for the best coffee beans you can get your hands on. Thankfully, coffee subscriptions can help you discover and explore new coffee beans from across the world.Our favorite coffee subscription service that we've ever tested is from Counter Culture Coffee. The brand is totally transparent when it comes to its beans, giving information about the origin, altitude and roasting date. The subscription changes constantly, offering new beans and plenty of chances to expand your coffee palate.Another great coffee subscription service comes from Atlas Coffee Club. What we like about Atlas is the fact that each delivery brings you roasts from a different country of origin. With Atlas Coffee Club, you’ll experience the wide range of flavors that the globe has to offer.Shop Counter CultureShop Atlas Coffee Club8. Our favorite French pressThe SterlingPro SS Double Wall Cafetiere received high marks across the board on all of our tests.While French presses require a little more work than other coffee makers, the fruits of their labor are so, so tasty. It's no surprise that baristas and coffee enthusiasts love the French press. After testing plenty of French presses, Reviewed ranked the SterlingPro SS Double Wall Cafetiere as our favorite stainless-steel french press. Its lightweight, double-wall design provides amazing insulation, keeping the coffee hot and the exterior cool to the touch. The press also features a large capacity, holding a whopping six cups of coffee (where the average is about four).$37 at Amazon9. A stellar cold brew makerThe Takeya cold brew coffee maker is inexpensive and simple to use.Cold brew coffee is all the rage at local and chain coffee shops alike. It's basically an extra-strength cup of iced coffee that offers less bitterness, while still maintaining tons of flavor. The downside: buying it out all the time is an expensive habit. You can save some serious dough by making your own cold brew right at home. All it takes is steeping coffee grinds in cold or room temperature water for an extended period of time and you've got a smooth, powerful brew.Our favorite device to make cold brew is the Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker. We tested it against several other models on the market and found it to be easy to use, easy to clean (it's dishwasher safe!) and it yielded around four servings of perfectly balanced coffee—not too acidic nor watered down. Not to mention, it won't break the bank and will save you money in the long run.$28 at Amazon10. A reliable mug for homeThere are many beautiful mugs to choose from when drinking your coffee at home.When you’re sipping coffee from the comfort of your home, you want a mug that’s both convenient and allows you to appreciate your drink as you take in the flavor. For this, we recommend adding the Bodum Bistro Coffee Mug to your cupboard. It’s one of the best coffee mugs for home use as its insulation helps keep your drink warm longer. The Bodum Bistro mug is most notable for its transparent glass, which allows you to easily tell how much is left.If you’re looking for the mug of the future, then look no further than the Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug. It maintains your coffee’s perfect temperature and alerts you when your drink is ready to sip.$38 at Amazon$144 at Amazon11. A solid travel mugThe Zojirushi travel mug is an absolute beast when it comes to keeping your drinks nice and hot.Drinking your cup o’ joe on the go? You’ll want a travel mug that's easy to carry, simple to store and, most importantly, keeps your coffee piping hot as long as possible.After testing a variety of travel mugs, judging mugs on heat retention and spill-proof mechanisms, the 16 oz. Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug rose to the occasion. When it comes to retaining temperature, it does an incredible job—it actually rose in temperature by 6 degrees over half an hour. If you need a new go-to travel mug, consider this your best option.$30 at AmazonThere’s a lot more where this came from.

According to a probability model by Ned Davis Research, there is currently a 98.1% chance of a recession globally. The only other time the probability model showed such results was during the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, according to a report by Bloomberg. This current economic downturn has made investors explore different investment strategies to cope with uncertainty.Dividend stocks are becoming increasingly popular among investors because of their ability to generate regular income. Analysts around the world are recommending adding dividend stocks to portfolios to fight the current economic instability.Austin Graff, co-chief investment officer at Titleist Asset Management, gave a positive stance about dividend investing in his interview with CNN this September. He said that dividend-paying stocks perform well during inflation because these companies have sound fundamentals and strong balance sheets. He further said that investors should focus on dividend companies with solid histories of raising their dividends as these companies have stable free cash flow generation to support their dividends.According to a report published by ProShares, companies with proven track records of dividend growth have delivered better returns than the broader index. From April 2010 to March 2015, the S&amp;P 500 returned 14.47% while the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered a 16.83% return to shareholders.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.1bUS$28.6bUS$31.4bUS$30.4bUS$29.9bUS$29.8bUS$29.9bUS$30.1bUS$30.5bUS$30.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -1.47%Est @ -0.45%Est @ 0.27%Est @ 0.77%Est @ 1.12%Est @ 1.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.4% US$22.9kUS$25.8kUS$26.8kUS$24.6kUS$23.0kUS$21.7kUS$20.6kUS$19.7kUS$18.9kUS$18.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$222bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$31b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.4%– 1.9%) = US$898bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$898b÷ ( 1 + 5.4%)10= US$529bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$751b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$505, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.826. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

""These investments and innovations will make a meaningful impact on the experience and value we provide to our members – in ways only UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage can.""More than 8.2 million peoplei are currently enrolled in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plans, and more than a third of all Medicare Advantage enrollment growth over the past five years, including 2022, has been through UnitedHealthcare.iiIn 2023, the company will expand its service area to reach 95% of Medicare consumers nationwide and maintain the industry’s largest Medicare Advantage footprint – including nearly 2.3 million more people in 314 additional counties with access to a standardiii Medicare Advantage plan and 145,000 more people eligible for a Dual Special Needs Plan (D-SNP).Highlights of UnitedHealthcare’s 2023 individual Medicare Advantage plans include:New Plan Features Bring Cost Savings, Support Whole-Person HealthD-SNP Utilities Credit: The combined over-the-counter (OTC) and healthy food benefit offered in 2022 on nearly all D-SNPs gave members three times more credit than the 2021 healthy food credit. In 2023, with food and utility prices rising higher than the average inflation rateiv, home utilities will be added to the benefit with an average annual credit of more than $2,200. This means Dual members can also choose to spend their monthly credit on expenses like home heat, electricity, water, sewer and home internet.D-SNP Home Support: With consumer research identifying home care services as a top desired benefit by Dual eligibles, UnitedHealthcare will offer a new home support services benefit on select D-SNPs. Members can use a $150-$225 quarterly credit toward support services including pest control, companion care, light cleaning, home modifications, yard maintenance and more.Flex Benefit: A new flex benefit on select plans can be used to extend existing dental, vision and hearing benefits after using these benefits. This annual benefit ranging from $150-$750 can be used to pay for Medicare-approved items and services like hearing aid copays, prescription sunglasses, out-of-network dental charges and more.Story continuesValue-Added Investments Across Core and Ancillary Benefits, Popular Plan FeaturesBenefit Stability: 99% of members in standard and Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs) will have stable or reduced premiums – including nearly 3.3 million members with a $0 premium – and all will have stable or improved core and prescription drug benefits.

C-SNP members will also have access to eight medications on a lower drug tier that target cardiovascular disease.Part D Coverage Gap: All standard plans will continue to provide tier 1 gap coverage, eliminating increased costs during the coverage gap and helping to ensure cost is not a barrier for members to stay adherent with their medications.$0 Drug Copays on Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNP): UnitedHealthcare will continue to expand access to $0 copays on covered drugs to 96% of our members enrolled in D-SNPs – bringing needed savings to more Dual members than any other carrier.Distinctive Offerings Support a Superior Member ExperienceUCard: A national rollout to more than 6.4 million individual Medicare Advantage members brings together the member ID with enhanced payment technology to create a single, integrated card that not only provides access to health care, but also allows members to shop with their benefits, spend earned rewards and more.

82,2b2c1645-fe44-32d3-8f62-c86f0bd6454b,EL,2022-10-02,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.'s (NYSE:EL) latest 5.7% decline adds to one-year losses, institutional investors may consider drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-130015942.html,1664629215,STORY,['EL'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 59% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 5.7% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 30% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Estée Lauder Companies, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Estée Lauder Companies. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Estée Lauder Companies?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Estée Lauder Companies. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Estée Lauder Companies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Estée Lauder Companies. Lal Family Partners, LP is currently the largest shareholder, with 23% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.0% and 4.6% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.. Insiders own US$6.2b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 23%, of the Estée Lauder Companies stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

83,130c2308-6a33-418d-ba79-d879a089671b,AAL,2022-10-02,Mesa Airlines' new training program can help 'break the pipeline' of pilot shortage: CEO,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mesa-airlines-new-training-program-can-help-break-the-pipeline-of-pilot-shortage-ceo-202824502.html,1664656104,STORY,"['AAL', 'UAL', 'DAL']","[The so-called “summer of travel hell” is behind us, but the ongoing national pilot shortage is still causing plenty of headwinds for the industry.Estimates vary, but one government estimate projects a shortfall of 18,000-plus pilots each year for the next decade.Mesa Airlines, a regional airline that flies for both United and American as well as cargo carrier DHL Express, says his company has a solution.CEO Jonathan Ornstein told Yahoo Finance his company is rolling out a program to provide would-be pilots with interest-free loans to help them accumulate the required number of in-air training miles to fly commercially in the United States.“What we've done is we just made an order for up to 104 smaller, light training aircraft, where we're effectively going to give people the opportunity to fly those aircraft, finance it completely. They don't pay us any money until they come to work. And the basic price, $25 an hour, is about literally 1/6 of what it would cost them to do it on their own. So it's just a terrific opportunity for new aspiring aviators to get into commercial aviation, which has now never been more lucrative,” Ornstein said.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The response from eager pilots has been overwhelmingly positive, with nearly 70 new signups in one day, Ornstein said. “There are 25,000 or more folks out there who want to fly in commercial aviation but cannot build the time quickly enough.”Ornstein said the company plans to hire everyone that completes the program, with starting wages at $100 an hour. “These people coming into the industry now, make probably close to $100,000 a year in their first year coming to work at Mesa.”In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) required commercial pilots to have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight training time, an increase from 250 hours. Republic Airways recently challenged this rule unsuccessfully, with the FAA citing safety concerns for shorter training periods.Ornstein says the FAA’s rules are exacerbating the pilot shortage. He pointed out the that European Union requires pilots acquire just 250 hours of training.“It’s kind of incredible that a big wide body aircraft flown by Air France or Lufthansa can fly into JFK with a pilot who has 400 hours and yet an American pilot is not deemed as capable somehow to fly a regional jet into Des Moines.”Story continuesIn recent months United, American, and Delta have cited the pilot shortage as a reason for cutting regional service to smaller cities such as Iowa’s Des Moines and Dubuque, New York’s Ithaca and Islip, and Ohio’s Toledo. Ornstein predicts the trend will continue. “We’re talking about the evaporation of the regional industry if we don’t do something quickly and I think the impact on the traveling public could be very, very significant.”The pilot shortage can be seen from coast to coast in reduced schedules and increased delays, cancellations and, of course, rising ticket prices. “The ultimate loser is the consumer,” said Ornstein. “Airline prices are up almost 35% year-over-year, service in 70% of all cities has declined and believe me, this is all due to the fact that we just don’t have enough people to fly aircraft.”The interest-free loan program launches in Florida next month, with Arizona to follow suit. Ornstein thinks the program will give Mesa an edge in hiring qualified pilots but hopes the idea will take off within the industry and “that other carriers do the same because if we work together in this respect, we could potentially solve the shortage.”David Briggs is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

84,9dbd176a-f46c-3de9-a6d8-cc7d806f4e4a,FCX,2022-10-02,7 Best Precious Metals Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-precious-metals-stocks-165916922.html,1664384356,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'SI=F', 'NEM', 'BHP', 'FCX', 'SCCO', 'GOLD', 'RGLD']","[With precious metals prices continuing to move inversely to interest rates, some investors would say that the best precious metals stocks to own right now are none of them. If you view precious metals strictly through the lens of gold and silver, I can’t blame you. As inflation soared, gold and silver did not hold up their end of the bargain. And with interest rates rising, a stronger dollar is taking out another reason to own precious metals.But the precious metals sector is broader than gold and silver. And that’s where the opportunity comes in. Many of these metals are essential to manufacturing the products that will transform our economy. These sectors haven’t been immune from supply chain difficulties, and that has made it a choppy year for precious metals stocks.But according to 360 Research Reports, the demand for precious metals is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% between now and 2028. And I don’t want to forget about gold. According to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global gold mining market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% from now through 2026.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, at their core, precious metals are commodities, and that makes investing in them a volatile proposition. Here, however, are seven of the best precious metals stocks to buy now.NEMNewmont Corporation$41.84GOLDBarrick Gold$14.75RGLDRoyal Gold$91.36FCXFreeport-McMoRan$27.47SCCOSouthern Copper$44.13BHPBHP Group$49.45ValeVale$12.77Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockLeading off this list of the best precious metals stocks is Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). The stock of the largest miner in the world soared to an all-time high in March 2022. But NEM stock is down 34% since that time as mining stocks have struggled to grab the attention of investors.Newmont is in a cycle in which its revenue continues to grow but its earnings drop versus the prior year. Rising capital costs are largely to blame for the declines in the miner’s profits. The company says, however, that it’s still on track to extract 6 million ounces of gold this year.Story continuesNEM stock provides investors with a good buying opportunity because  it is prioritizing shareholder value in the midst of this market volatility.Due to Newmont’s rising capital costs, the company probably will not be able to sustain its current $2.20 per share dividend . But the company has a long history of paying a dividend. And with analysts’ median price target standing at over $63 per share, the owners of NEM stock may get the profits they expect when they invest in mining stocks.Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD)October 18, 2020, Brazil. In this photo illustration the B&amp;G Foods logo seen displayed on a smartphone. BGS stockSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSticking with gold stocks, I will  take a look at the Canadian multinational miner, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). Like Newmont, Barrick is an established mining company with a high-yield dividend.After soaring to over $25 per share earlier this year, GOLD stock fell 44% and is trading near its 52-week low. But analysts are largely still bullish about the stock, and their average price target suggests the shares could make it back to their 52-week high.One reason to believe that may happen is the company’s geographical reach. In a sector whose underlying economics can be challenging, having exposure to different countries may turn out to be a winning strategy.In the meantime, GOLD stock pays a nice dividend yield of 2.83% and has a payout ratio of around 35% that looks sustainable.Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockThe last gold-related stock on this list is Royal Gold Inc. (NYSE:RGLD), and I included it specifically because it’s not a mining stock. The company essentially profits from the royalties generated by its acquisitions and its investments. Although some of its businesses are still in the exploratory phase, many are established companies that are generating reliable revenue and profits.RGLD stock is well off its 52-week high set in April 2022. However, the stock is down 18% for the year, slightly outpacing the performance of the S&amp;P 500. And although analysts have lowered their price targets for the stock, their median target suggests it will make back most of its losses for the year.While investors wait, they can count on an attractive dividend that has been growing for the last 20 years. and equates to a dividend yield of 1.62%.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is another mining stock. However, rather than being exclusively engaged in gold mining, the company has an extensive footprint in copper mining.FCX stock rose as the  infrastructure bill made its way through the U.S. Congress. The rally indicated that the price of copper would climb after the bill was passed. But macroeconomic challenges have blunted the demand for copper, hurting the short-term outlook of FCX stock.The company’s second-quarter revenue and earnings fell versus the previous quarter. That broke a streak of eight consecutive quarters of sequential gains, suggesting that the demand for copper is slowing.This may well be a case, however, of demand delayed rather than demand denied. If the United States remains committed to an electric-vehicle future, the demand for copper will have to rise.Southern Copper (SCCO)Piece of copper set against black backgroundSource: Coldmoon Photoproject/Shutterstock.comAnother company that will benefit from rising copper demand is Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO). The Phoenix, Arizona-based mining company produces refined gold, silver, and other precious metals, including copper. The company’s primary operations are in South America.SCCO stock is down 28% for the year, and the company’s current quarterly dividend of 75 cents per share is likely to come down. Still, the company has offered a dividend for many years, and it was upgraded by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).It really comes down to timing for investors. The commodities market isn’t going to tell them exactly when demand will increase. So if you have speculative cash to put into this sector, Southern Copper could be an attractive choice because it pays you a dividend while you’re waiting for commodities to rebound.BHP Group (BHP)One bar of silver has been pulled out from a larger pile.Source: ShutterstockSo far, we’ve looked at companies that offer investors solid balance sheets, but ones that may be currently overvalued. BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) offers investors the benefit of a solid balance sheet. But it does appear to be undervalued in the current market. The company has a price–earnings ratio of 5.7 times which is below its historical average of 7.25 times.The Australian mining company extracts and sells a range of metals including copper, silver, zinc nickel, uranium, iron ore, gold and molybdenum. Copper and nickel will likely be in high demand as the world pivots toward clean energy.And another InvestorPlace columnist, Josh Enomoto, recently reminded investors that BHP Group is a major producer of potash. The latter commodity has been in short supply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That  hasn’t been enough to keep BHP stock from turning negative for the year. But with the stock down “only” 8% in 2022, investors could do worse.Vale (VALE)Vale Stock Looks Strong Going Into 2020 After January's Brazil Dam BurstSource: ShutterstockThe last company on this list of the best precious metals stocks is Vale (NYSE:VALE) – the world’s leading producer of iron ore and nickel. At first glance, its story seems the same as every stock on this list because, like the other names, it is down for the year and pays a dividend.That’s the nature of this sector in 2022. And I can’t say for sure when the sector is going to turn around. But if you’re considering investing in Vale, you should do so because it provides a commodity that will be in high demand. Specifically, nickel is a key component of lithium-ion batteries.That will be a long-term catalyst for VALE stock which, trading at three times its earnings, looks significantly undervalued compared to the forward P/E ratio of the mining industry which stands  at 9.6 times.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

(NASDAQ:PEP) Suggests It's 32% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-110122405.html,1664708482,STORY,['PEP'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.90bUS$9.82bUS$10.3bUS$11.1bUS$11.7bUS$12.2bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.3%Est @ 4.29%Est @ 3.58%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.5% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$8.4kUS$8.9kUS$8.8kUS$9.0kUS$9.0kUS$8.9kUS$8.8kUS$8.6kUS$8.4kUS$8.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$413bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$413b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$246bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$333b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$163, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders disposed of US$16m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-140034175.html,1664632834,STORY,['REGN'],"[Over the past year, many Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, George Sing, sold US$7.0m worth of shares at a price of US$660 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$689). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 23% of George Sing's holding.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. In total, Independent Director Arthur Ryan dumped US$4.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own about US$3.1b worth of shares (which is 4.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insiders?An insider sold Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

87,e35ca4a6-636f-3481-8c35-d9a2b5a8c8cf,GPS,2022-10-02,7 Consumer Stocks to Sell Before They Die,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-stocks-sell-die-191650744.html,1664392610,STORY,"['WBA', 'GPS', 'AEO', 'KHC', 'TGT', 'UL', 'M']","[This year, consumer stocks have been hammered as inflation lingers at 40-year highs and interest rates rise. The Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods Index is down 20% this year as consumers pull back on their spending. However, some consumer-focused companies have performed worse than others. Much worse. Whether it is due to poor management, failure to adapt to a changing marketplace, or doomed deals, some consumer-oriented stocks have suffered 50% or more declines through the first nine months of the year. Many companies are clearly in jeopardy, and analysts question their long-term viability. Thus, investors would be best advised to avoid such companies in danger. With that in mind, here are the following seven consumer stocks to sell:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$153.25GPSGap Inc$8.69ULUnilever$43.67AEOAmerican Eagle Outfitters$10.46MMacy’s$16.49WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$32.59KHCKraft Heinz$33.34Target (TGT)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt may not die, but consumer retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) sure hasn’t been the same coming out of the pandemic. The company has spent most of this year selling off excess inventory at deeply discounted prices as it adjusts to slowing consumer demand. The result has been that the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company has lowered its forward guidance twice this year, and its quarterly profit declined nearly 90% in the three months ended July 30. The turmoil has weighed heavily on TGT stock, down 36% on the year and trading at just over $150 a share.While some shareholders have called for new management, it was announced earlier in September that Target’s CEO Brian Cornell will remain in his position for three more years after Target did away with its mandatory retirement age of 65. Of course, Target may get its inventory back down to manageable levels. However, it is still grappling with inflationary pressures, slowing consumer spending, and ongoing supply chain constraints, likely to continue lowering its share price in the coming months. Thus, I believe Target is one of the top consumer stocks to sell.Story continuesGap Inc (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockIt’s been an equally ugly year for clothing retailer Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The San Francisco-based company has seen its stock price fall 65% in the last 12 months, including a 53% decline this year. GPS stock now trades at $8.69 and continues to slump. The most recent news out of the company is that it is laying off 500 employees, equal to about 5% of its 8,700 global workers. The job cuts come amid mounting losses and turmoil at the company’s upper echelons.In July, Gap announced that CEO Sonia Syngal was stepping down immediately after less than three years in the position. This is as sales continue to weaken across the board at Gap Inc and its other retail chain Old Navy. Even singer Kanye West has abandoned the Gap brand, announcing recently that he is terminating early his two-year promotional deal with Gap, citing “substantial noncompliance” with the terms of the contract. Et Tu Kanye?Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comGiven that it’s the largest maker of soap in the world, among many other consumer products, one would assume that shares of Unilever (NYSE:UL) would be pretty resilient to this year’s market downturn. But it is not. Unfortunately, UL stock is down 19% year to date and trading at $43.67 a share. This is even though Unilever makes many of the most beloved and essential consumer products worldwide, ranging from Dove soap to Sunlight laundry detergent and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream.The deflated share price comes as consumer spending rolls over and also as Unilever’s CEO prepares to exit the company. Also, Unilever is grappling with famed activist investor Nelson Peltz, who now has a seat on the company’s board of directors. Unilever CEO Alan Jope announced his plans to retire following a failed attempt to buy the consumer healthcare business of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). For his part, Peltz wants Unilever to become a leaner, more nimble company. Shortly after Peltz joined the board, Unilever announced plans to cut 1,500 management jobs and reshape its business.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)Source: ShutterstockLike Gap, clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) has had a bruising year. Since January, AEO stock has fallen 60% to trade at $10.46 a share. The Pittsburgh-based company is struggling with all the same challenges as the other companies on this list. Inflation, declining consumer spending, and supply constraints have hurt American Eagle Outfitters’ earnings. The company’s most recent financial results showed that its inventory levels rose 36.3%, even though its gross margins fell to 30.9% from 44.3%.Consequently, American Eagle Outfitters has been forced to deeply discount its clothing merchandise to sell and reduce its inventory levels. All the discounting led American Eagle Outfitters to report a second-quarter earnings-per-share (or EPS) profit of 4 cents, which was well below the 60 cents a share expected on Wall Street. The company also announced that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, which yielded a hefty 6.2%. The canceled dividend payment sent many shareholders rushing for the exits, making it one of they key consumer stocks to sell.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comIt seems like a long time ago now that department store chain Macy’s (NYSE:M) was thriving during the pandemic. But this year, M stock has plummeted 42% to change hands at $16.49 per share. The stock is far from its all-time high of $70 a share in 2015. While the company has traditionally thrived during the year-end holiday shopping season, Macy’s seemed to acknowledge that it doesn’t anticipate robust consumer spending this year, announcing that it plans to hire 41,000 seasonal workers for the holidays this year, 46% of the 76,000-holiday staff hired in 2021.Macy’s has been trying its best to navigate these uncertain times by enhancing its digital/online sales channels. But here, too, Macy’s has struggled. In its most recent quarter, the company announced that its digital sales declined 5% yearly. The company has announced a three-year plan to turn around its fortunes, which it calls “Polaris.” However, the plan seems to have underwhelmed analysts who cover the company. Macy’s most recently lowered its forward guidance and says it now expects fiscal 2022 revenue from $24.34 billion to $24.58 billion, down from previous forecasts of $24.46 billion to $24.7 billion. Thus, making it one of the consumer stocks to sell.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also did well during the pandemic when its more than 8,900 drugstores sprinkled across all 50 states dispensed Covid-19 vaccinations. But this year has been another story.Through nearly nine months of 2022, WBA stock is down 38% at around $32.59 a share. The stock has been deep-sixed since Walgreens announced plans to spend $5.2 billion to acquire the primary care company VillageMD last year.The plan is to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations within Walgreens outlets by 2027. The primary care locations will provide medical services to customers of Walgreens, combining direct medical treatments and pharmaceutical medicines under one roof. While that might sound good on paper, investors appear to be concerned with the hefty amount invested in VillageMD and a slowdown in consumer foot traffic at Walgreen locations coming out of the pandemic. Therefore, it will be a while before the VillageMD plan shows any results.Kraft Heinz (KHC)Heinz (KHC) ketchup bottle about to squeeze out ketchupSource: SSokolov / Shutterstock.comYou know it’s bad when legendary investor Warren Buffett says he regrets buying a stock. While the Oracle of Omaha still owns nearly $11 billion worth of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock, it is undoubtedly one of his worst investments. Over the past five years, KHC stock has fallen more than 60% to trade at $33.34 per share. Over the last ten years, the stock has declined 27%, leading many analysts to refer to Kraft Heinz as a value trap.The food company that makes everything from ketchup to cream cheese and owns popular brands such as Oscar Mayer hot dogs has seen its share price deflate since Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged in 2015 at a price tag of $49 billion, creating the third-largest food company in North America.While the merger, with its promised synergies and competitive advantages, lured many investors, including Buffett, those benefits have never really materialized. And that’s led to KHC stock steadily eroding over the past seven years, making it one of the top consumer stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.
