Compounding negative sentiment has been increased regulatory scrutiny, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's move this month to sue crypto giants Coinbase Global and Binance, alleging violation of its rules. The pair deny the allegations.Bitcoin has gained nearly 25% in value since BlackRock's filing. It rose as high as $31,458 on Friday, the highest level since June 7, 2022, and was last up 3.29% at $30,872.""The dark clouds overshadowing crypto have lifted in recent days amid a burst of institutional interest,"" said Kate Laurence, general partner of Bloccelerate VC, which invests in crypto projects.""The likes of BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Citadel throwing their hats into the crypto ring is hugely significant because it shows that institutions are very serious about the space - despite the recent regulatory crackdown.""Story continuesInvestors piled into cryptocurrencies when interest rates were low, pushing the market to a peak value of $3 trillion in 2021. But they turned cautious as rates rose, with the value of the market now standing at around $1.24 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen more than 16% since last week. It was up 1.63% at 1,903.20 on Friday.Some market-watchers said the SEC crackdown may be good for bitcoin, which is generally considered a commodity rather than a security, and therefore beyond the SEC's remit.""The SEC lawsuit has created opportunities for robust, regulated players, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this BlackRock event will have some sustainability,"" said Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research.

3,f66d1146-fe10-3fb8-b1c9-f9c643299315,NUE,2023-06-24,Nucor Corporation (NUE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-trending-stock-130013644.html,1687525213,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned +13.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -44.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $17.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -40.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.86 indicates a change of -30.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $9.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -23.4%. The $35.44 billion and $33.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.6% and -6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ARE and its former real estate joint venture (JV) partner recently concluded the recapitalization of 9625 Towne Centre Drive and divested 70% of their interest in the property. The move aligns with the company’s value-harvesting and asset-recycling self-funding strategy.The transaction was valued at $160.5 million or $981 per rentable square feet (RSF) with a strong capitalization rate of 4.5% based on ARE’s annualized cash net operating income (NOI) for the second quarter of 2023.With this latest development, Alexandria now owns 30% interest in the Class A life science facility compared with 50.1% owned earlier. While the JV partner completely exited from the investment, ARE retained its operating control over the property.Moreover, ARE gained $32.3 million as its share from the sales price and a value-creation margin of 88%, making the move a strategic fit. It intends to reinvest the proceeds from the disposition into its highly leased value-creation pipeline to capitalize on the secular trends of the life science industry.The stand-alone operating property in San Diego's University Town Center was redeveloped in 2017 by Alexandria and delivered to Takeda TAK, a multinational pharmaceutical company, in 2018. The LEED Gold and Fitwel certified facility, encompassing 163,648 RSF, is fully leased to Takeda and can be expanded by 100,000 square feet or more.Focusing on its capital-recycling strategy, and dispositions and sales of partial interests target of $1.525 billion (at the midpoint of its guidance of $1.425–$1.625 billion) for 2023, this June, the company disposed of five non-core, non-mega campus properties in Greater Boston to affiliates of TPG Real Estate Partners.  The sale of the portfolio, encompassing 428,663 RSF, was carried out for $365 million or an average sales price of $852 per RSF. Based on ARE’s NOI for second-quarter 2023, the weighted average capitalization rate was 5.2%, inclusive of vacancies available for redevelopment. The transaction yielded a gain on sale of $187.2 million and a value-creation margin of 80%.Further, in May 2023, it sold 11119 North Torrey Pines Road, a fully leased 72,506 RSF single-tenant property, in its San Diego cluster to DivcoWest for $86 million. The capitalization rate was 4.6% based on ARE’s annualized NOI for first-quarter 2023, yielding significant realized value for the company.Alexandria’s Class A properties are located in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Also, ARE’s focus on acquiring, developing and redeveloping new Class A properties in AAA locations bodes well for its external growth. As of Mar 31, 2023, its current and near-term value-creation projects totaled 6.7 million RSF and were 72% leased, which is encouraging.The company expects to capture more than $610 million of annual incremental NOI from the second quarter of 2023 through the first quarter of 2026 with these projects.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, ARE is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 12.3% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s decline of 5.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR and Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST. While Host Hotels sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Let’s take a closer look at each.American WoodmarkAmerican Woodmark is the third-largest manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets.

The stock sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has been a big-time earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of nearly 30% across its last four quarters.

8,34fd3f2a-1251-3d00-8e04-c2da8d2b5d05,USB,2023-06-24,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-dips-more-215020506.html,1687557020,STORY,['USB'],"[U.S. Bancorp (USB) closed at $31.88 in the latest trading session, marking a -1.09% move from the prior day. This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.77%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.65%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.23%.Heading into today, shares of the company had gained 5.64% over the past month, outpacing the Finance sector's gain of 2% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.66% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from U.S. Bancorp as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be July 19, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.17, up 7.34% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.17 billion, up 19.9% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.59 per share and revenue of $28.73 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.15% and +18.8%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for U.S. Bancorp should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant.

Depending on where you live, you’ll save a lot more at the discount chain than shoppers elsewhere – especially when it comes to your grocery bill.See: 8 Essentials You’ll Be Shocked You Can Buy at Dollar TreeFind: 9 Things You Should Never Buy at Thrift StoresPrices of identical products at Walmart vary from state to state — and sometimes the difference is substantial. For example, a typical basket of food and home products from a Walmart in Tennessee costs 14.3% more than the national average, according to a new study from Cashnet USA. Just over the border in Kentucky, the same basket costs 6.7% less than the national average.The study, conducted in February 2023 and released on June 15, was based on a pair of 12-item grocery lists covering regular and vegan goods. The regular grocery list included milk, bananas, boneless chicken breast, canned tuna, tomatoes, local cheese, breakfast cereal, eggs, bottled water, fresh white bread, potatoes and vegetable oil. The vegan list included some of those items as well as soya milk, vegan cheese, brown rice, tinned chickpeas, coconut oil and frozen veggie burgers.Related: 6 Best Items To Buy at Aldi This SummerCashnet USA researched the total price for each list based on Walmart’s own brands in each state’s biggest city and then compared them against the national average. After that, researchers calculated the price premium for groceries by state. They also used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare each bill to the average local income for each state.Among its key findings:Walmart grocery prices in Hawaii cost 26.2% more than the national average — the highest disparity in the U.S. That’s no surprise, given high supply-chain costs getting goods to the islands.West Virginia has the cheapest regular Walmart groceries, at 7.7% less than the national average.The cheapest vegan groceries are in New Mexico, where they cost 5% below the national average. The most expensive are in Hawaii, where vegan groceries cost 25.7% above the national average.It takes two hours and two minutes of work to afford the average basket of regular Walmart groceries in Alabama — the lowest local affordability of any state.Walmart groceries in New York State offer the best buys based on local income, helped by the state’s high average earnings (boosted considerably by earnings in New York City, which has no Walmart).Story continuesWhat’s striking about the study is that regions of the country normally associated with low costs of living, such as the Southeast, included many states where Walmart grocery prices are higher than the national average. Conversely, certain regions where costs of living are high — like the Northeast — tend to have lower-than-average Walmart grocery prices.Here’s a look at the 10 states that have the lowest average Walmart grocery prices compared to the national average:West Virginia: 7.7% below the national average.Delaware: 7.1% below.Kentucky: 6.7% below.Ohio: 6.5% below.Kansas: 6.17% below.Michigan: 5.1% below.Pennsylvania: 5% below.New York: 4.8% below.Oklahoma: 4.7% below.Nebraska: 4.5% below.Here are the 10 states with the highest average Walmart grocery prices compared to the national average:Hawaii: 26.2% above the national average.Alaska: 20.1% above.Tennessee: 14.3% above.Georgia: 14.2% above.Missouri: 13.2% above.Alabama: 12.5% above.California: 5.1% above.Minnesota: 2.4% above.Arkansas: 2.5% above.North Carolina: 1.6% above.If you’re wondering which state comes closest to hitting the national average, it’s Louisiana, where average Walmart grocery prices are 0.2% above the national average.

11,bd79a3a6-7ac5-3df1-8c79-90e0e9140bd9,WMT,2023-06-24,Graphic Package Holding and Vornado Realty have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-package-holding-vornado-realty-121600234.html,1687522560,STORY,"['VNO', 'PG', 'WMT', 'GPK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 23, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Graphic Package Holding Co. GPK as the Bull of the Day and Vornado Realty Trust VNO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart WMT, McDonald’s MCD and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Graphic Package Holding Co. is a prominent and dynamic multinational corporation that specializes in providing innovative packaging solutions to various industries. With a strong global presence and a history dating back several decades, GPK has established itself as a leader in the packaging industry.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a historically cheap valuation, strong earnings growth and expanding operations, Graphic Packaging Holding Company is a worthy consideration for any investment portfolio.Industry Leading ProductsThe company's comprehensive portfolio encompasses a wide range of packaging products, including corrugated containers, folding cartons, displays, and labels. GPK has been capitalizing on the newest trends in consumer packaging and is producing some of the highest quality renewable and recyclable, fiber-based packaging in the industry.At its most recent quarterly earnings meeting, management announced that Chick-Fil-A, the most profitable fast-food chain in the US, would be launching GPK’s new, highly insulated, double-wall fiber-based cups as a potential long-term solution for their beverage program.Steady Stock PerformanceGraphic Package Holding Company has been an extremely steady and impressive performing stock. Over the last decade GPK has compounded at 14% annually, beating both the broad market and industry. Additionally, GPK offers a tidy 1.6% dividend yield, which has increased 10% annually over the last three years.Earnings TrendGPK has experienced consistent revisions higher in its earnings estimates since 2021, following the steady pace of returns in the stock. The last two months have seen especially strong earnings revisions giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesCurrent quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 7% over the last two months and are projected to grow 28% YoY. Additionally, FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 10.2% and are expected to climb 30% YoY.Considering sales are expected to grow 6% YoY in the current quarter and FY23, and earnings are expected to grow multiples of that, GPK is clearly improving business efficiency. The company’s CEO Michael Doss recently noted that “during the (most recent) quarter our newest coated recycled paperboard machine in Kalamazoo exceeded quality, yield and financial expectations,” indicating those upgraded efficiencies.Reasonable ValuationGraphic Packaging Holding Company is currently trading at a 10-year low in terms of earnings multiples. Its one-year forward earnings multiple is just 8x, which is well below the market average of 20x, below the industry average of 13x, and its 10-year median of 16.5x.Bottom LineWhile packaging materials may not be quite as sexy as AI or Crypto, Graphic Package Holding Company is making its investors considerable wealth, nonetheless. GPK has an impressive performance history and strong projections for earnings growth. With robust earnings estimate revisions and a cheap valuation GPK stock has the wind at its back.Bear of the Day:Vornado Realty Trust, the owner and manager of a considerable portfolio of premium office real estate has been crushed by the shifting commercial real estate market, and explosion of work from home jobs. VNO has endured considerable downgrades to its earnings expectations over the last 18 months giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).CompanyVornado Realty Trust is a leading US real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in commercial properties. Established in 1982, Vornado owns, develops, and manages prime office buildings, retail centers, and residential properties in major markets such as New York City and Washington, DC. The company focuses on strategic investments, value creation through renovations and repositioning. Vornado is also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and is the largest owner of LEED-certified property in the United States, with more than 27 million square feet of LEED-certified properties.Challenged EnvironmentShares in the VNO REIT have suffered over the last five years, down -72% over that time. This is significantly worse than the industry average and broad market. Vornado has a high concentration of buildings in metropolitan areas that have changed dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic.While office buildings in NYC were once thought of as premier assets, they have been completely upended by the transition to work from home. While top of the market assets, like those owned by Vornado have held up a bit better than the rest of the market, Manhattan landlords are still struggling to fill their properties. Q1 office vacancy in Manhattan was estimated at 16% and analysts expect more distress in the sector.Earnings EstimatesRecord high vacancies, as well as a high interest rate environment, which strains real estate businesses, does not bode well for VNO’s earnings expectations. Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in downgrading estimates across timeframes.Current quarter earnings have been revised lower by -4.5% over the last two months and are expected to decline -23% YoY. FY23 earnings have been cut by -4.2% and are projected to slide -20% YoY.ValuationBecause of the severe decline VNO’s share prices over the last two years, its valuation is at a 10-year low. Vornado Realty Trust is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6.2x, which is well below the industry average of 14.7x, and below its 10-year median of 18x.ConclusionVornado Realty Trust is under tremendous pressure, and it does not look like things will be getting better anytime soon. While the 9.7% dividend yield may have been the only thing drawing in investors today it may not be worth the risk. Vornado announced a -29% cut in the dividend in January, and in April announced that all dividend payments will be postponed until the end of 2023.Because of the reasons listed above it is recommended that investors steer clear of Vornado Realty Trust.Additional content:3 Low-Beta Stocks Suited Nicely for Risk-Averse InvestorsLow-beta stocks would be great considerations for investors looking to shield themselves against volatility, as they have historically shown to be less affected by broader market fluctuations.To give a quick refresher, beta measures a stock's volatility or systematic risk compared to the overall market.Stocks with a beta of less than 1.0 provide more stability during volatile periods, and the inverse is also true – stocks with a beta of higher than 1.0 are more susceptible to the broader market’s movements.For those seeking a more conservative approach, three low-beta stocks – Walmart, McDonald’s and Procter &amp; Gamble – could all be considered.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, have an established track record of stable growth, and consistently shell out dividends, undoubtedly a strong trio. Let’s take a closer look at each.WalmartWalmart offers a diverse blend of products at reasonable prices, allowing it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The retail titan posted strong results in its latest release, delivering year-over-year global eCommerce growth of 26% and raising its FY24 outlook. Quarterly revenue totaled $152.2 billion, ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.In addition, Walmart’s 21.3% trailing twelve-month ROE is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets. As shown below, the current value is well above the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.And to top it off, Walmart is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, putting its shareholder-friendly nature on full display. Shares currently yield 1.5% annually, with the payout growing 2% over the last five years.McDonald’sWe’re all familiar with the restaurant titan McDonald’s, seeing those golden arches at seemingly every stop. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Shares may not entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the Style Score of “D” for Value. MCD shares currently trade at a 26.6X forward earnings multiple, modestly above the five-year median and Zacks sector average.Still, investors haven’t minded forking up the premium for shares given the company’s favorable growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 8% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, estimates call for an additional 9% uptick in earnings and 7% sales growth.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), posted better-than-expected results and provided optimistic guidance in its latest release, helping shares close 3.5% higher post-earnings. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Procter &amp; Gamble is a classic dividend stock, holding the ranks of not only a Dividend Aristocrat but a Dividend King as well. PG shares currently yield 2.5% annually, with the company carrying a solid 6.3% five-year annualized growth rate.In addition, it’s worth noting that shares have recently found support near the $142 per share level, a previous resistance level for the stock.Bottom LineFor those seeking a more conservative approach, low-beta stocks provide precisely that. These stocks are less susceptible to the broader market’s movements, helping to limit those spooky price swings.And all three stocks could be great considerations for those looking for stability.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank and have an established track record of success, undeniably significant benefits.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the analyst's comments.Video Transcript- Under Armor shares dipping on a downgrade from Wells Fargo. The analyst lowering the athletic company's rating to equal weight and slashing its price target to $8 a share from $12 a share. Now, the team at Wells Fargo citing three main issues for Under Armor-- outsized wholesale exposure, elevated inventory, and C-suite shuffling.Elevated inventory-- that's something we've been talking about a lot when it comes to these retailers. Under Armor's elevated inventory was up 44% the last quarter. So they need to do even more here. Really a lot to clear some of that excess inventory that they've been struggling with. And that C-suite reshuffling, their new CEO Stephanie Linnartz, she's only been in the job for less than six months. So she hasn't had exactly the opportunity yet to really turn things around.DIANE KING HALL: It's true. And she will have to focus along with the rest of the executive team on dealing with those inventory issues. We saw those issues come up with Nike as well. They got hit on that, especially because of their exposure to Foot Locker, which is a major wholesale client for Nike. So not surprised to see the inventory issues that Under Armor has.So this one will be one to watch in how they resolve that.- Yeah, certainly. And they were saying that the recovery story is now turning into a show me story. And that's likely going to be rangebound here within the next six to 12 months. So we'll see whether Stephanie is able to turn it around.DIANE KING HALL: I like that line in the note, the show me story. Yeah. Show me the money. I remember that one.]"

MMC recently joined hands with the Ukraine government to help it gain access to the global insurance market. MMC will be providing services on a pro-bono basis to the distressed Ukraine economy.MMC aims to create a war risk insurance pool for the Ukrainian and G7 governments. Under this partnership, MMC will provide a risk data platform enabling insurers to calculate and underwrite war risks in Ukraine with greater conviction. The partnership bodes well, as MMC earlier collaborated with Lloyd’s insurer to provide insurance coverage for grain exporters. This has also improved the supply chain to function properly.Marsh &amp; McLennan’s business model provides professional services related to risk, people and strategy for a fee. Its top line is dependent on the level of business activity of clients. Any financial difficulty for the clients due to the Russia-Ukraine war may result in delayed payments, affecting the company’s top line. However, the partnership is expected to boost Ukraine’s economy and help MMC’s clients, which will aid the company’s top line in the long-run.The Ukrainian government will provide detailed information to insurance industry players to help revive its commercial insurance market.

17,b7a293f6-ecd2-367c-ab82-3555af5f80e1,NCLH,2023-06-24,Cruise Industry Riding on High Demand: 3 Stocks to Benefit,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cruise-industry-riding-high-demand-162600599.html,1687537560,STORY,"['CUK', 'RCL', 'NCLH']","[The cruise industry's toughest days appear to be behind it. The industry demonstrated resiliency on the back of the shift in customers’ preferences toward leisure travel and ongoing demand creation rate.Pent-up demand for cruise vacations and the fine-tuning of individual brand positioning and marketing initiatives are likely to have opened the way for the addition of more first-time cruise guests. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (or CLIA) report, the number of passengers sailing on cruises is expected to increase by 106% from 2019 levels to 31.5 million. In contrast, the UNWTO predicted in January 2023 that foreign visitor arrivals will be between 80% and 95% of 2019 levels in 2023.What’s Driving the Industry?Businesses continue to implement strategic initiatives across their operations to boost operational effectiveness and appropriately size their cost base to rebuild and increase profits. While preserving the outstanding guest experience and superior service levels, they are making conscious efforts to increase margins.Major cruise companies have deployed strategic investment plans to expand and renew their fleet. This includes luxurious accommodations, world-class dining options, captivating entertainment and a wide range of recreational activities.Backed by the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem and the efficiency in the respected company’s financial structure, new ships are able to contribute immediately and expected to be important drivers of future earnings growth and margin expansion. According to the CLIA orderbook, 14 new ships that provide fresh itineraries and experiences will be put into service in 2023.The companies are emphasizing on onboard revenue generation. This serves as a real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially. Cruise operators are of the opinion that guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend significantly more than those who do not pre-book onboard activities.Going by the purview, companies are expanding the number of high-quality touch points they have with their customers (starting at the time of booking) to increase revenues and prepayment before a cruise. These players have started honing their digital performance marketing strategies, perfecting search engine optimization and testing fresh lead creation ideas. They have also emphasized on redesigning websites to increase online traffic, improve conversion and achieve higher pre-cruise onboard sales.Story continuesRoad AheadAlthough companies are bearing the brunt of a challenging macroeconomic environment, reinvestments in terms of advertisement and sales support are likely to be initiatives placed in the right direction.The ability to close the occupancy gap (from pre-pandemic levels) and successfully generate demand help these companies lower opaque channel activity and raise ticket pricing to counteract the negative effects of fuel price and currency fluctuations. Notably, much optimism prevails on account of new hardware, a strong pricing environment, and continued growth from onboard revenue areas.Per the report, the Cruise industry is expected to generate revenues of US$25.14 billion in 2023. By 2027, the market volume is anticipated to hit US$35.87 billion. This represents an annual revenue forecast expansion of 9.29% CAGR (2023-2027).Investing in the Consumer Discretionary sector might sound profitable right now, it is worth noting that the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is currently at the top 31% (with the rank of 79) of the 251 Zacks industries, which hints at further growth.3 Cruise Stocks to Watch Out ForGiven the backdrop, here are three cruise stocks that are likely to move higher in 2023. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 3 (Hold). These companies have witnessed a sharp rise in share price in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL is poised to benefit from improvements in booking activities, e-commerce enhancements and fleet-expansion efforts. Also, the improved pricing environment and the continued strength in onboard revenue areas bode well. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported early consumer engagement, with about 2/3 of its guests purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings. This compares with 48% of guests reported in 2019. The company stated that every dollar of pre-cruse spending translates into approximately $0.70 of incremental spend (on board). Secular tailwinds, courtesy of the shift in consumers’ preferences from goods to entertainment and travel spending (24% higher than 2019 levels), added to the positives. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.Royal Caribbean currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has gained 133.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15% growth. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RCL’s financial-year sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests an increase of 48.5% and 162.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH will likely benefit from strong booking activities, occupancy improvement and fleet-expansion efforts. During the first quarter of 2023, the company generated solid booking volumes, courtesy of strong demand in the WAVE season. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 are higher than 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $3.4 billion, up 26% (from the previous quarter’s levels) and 60% (from 2019 levels). The company stated pricing levels to be elevated. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods. Also, the emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Norwegian Cruise currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has gained 44.3% in the past year. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NCLH’s financial-year sales and EPS suggests an increase of 77.3% and 116.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Carnival Corporation &amp; plc CCL has been benefitting from strong demand for cruising, bundled package offerings and pre-cruise sales. Also, it stated the benefits of increased advertising activities. During the fiscal first quarter, the company reported solid bookings for the North America and Australia (NAA) and Europe segments. The company stated that its NAA bookings curve mirrored peak 2019 levels, while the European recovery trajectory was more than 80% of 2019 levels. The company stated that its 2023 cumulative advanced booked position is at increased prices compared with 2019 levels. The company intends to focus on strategic deployments (closer to guests’ home itineraries) and shorter-duration cruises to reduce the friction of air travel and boost the booking environment.Carnival currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has gained 45.3% in the past year. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s financial-year sales and EPS suggests an increase of 72.3% and 93.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

18,d082785b-ef9f-3057-86f3-d6039a554986,MET,2023-06-24,10 Annuity Companies To Avoid,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-annuity-companies-avoid-234157601.html,1687563717,STORY,"['UNH', 'MKL', 'MET']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 annuity companies to avoid if you are looking for companies with minimal risk. To see more of these companies, you can go directly to see the 5 Annuity Companies To Avoid.In one of our previous articles, we explained how annuities are considered to be a more specialized concept within the insurance industry. To briefly recap, annuities are a form of insurance that take the shape of contracts between insurance companies and their clients, with the requirement being placed on the insurer to make payments to their customers. These payments may be made either immediately or at some point in the future, based on the type of annuity you get. As far as the customer is concerned, they can purchase an annuity through either a single, one-time payment or by making a series of payments that are spread out over several years. As we mentioned before, the four main types of annuities include immediate annuities, deferred annuities, fixed annuities, and variable annuities. This form of insurance, and the companies that offer them to their clients, will be the subject of our article today, with a specific focus on which companies should be avoided within this space, considering their financial health.Global Insurance In A BindThe insurance industry at large is considered to be one that has been suffering from widespread instability over the past few years. Due to this, insurance companies such as Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) are having to face grown challenges induced by digital changes, rising concerns surrounding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, and more. According to a McKinsey report on the insurance industry, published in November 2022, the industry has been suffering in terms of its performance and relevance. One major indicator of this is that nominal GDP growth seems to have outpaced premium growth. The report mentioned that in the US and Europe, while nominal GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4% over the 20 years preceding 2022, premium growth grew by a compound annual growth rate of merely 2% over the same period. Similar trends have been noted in Asia as well.Story continuesThe report also mentions that the insurance industry struggled to generate returns in excess of the cost of capital over the same period of 20 years. Additionally, the situation shows that insurance carriers have been unable to structurally address their cost base. This has resulted in the insurance industry lagging behind others, such as the asset management industry, which has managed to address its costs and mitigate their impact on its revenues. According to McKinsey, this has resulted in the insurance industry's costs as a share of revenues increasing by 23% since 2003. Several other observations in the report seem to paint a bleak picture regarding the performance of the insurance industry thus far.Optimism From Other AvenuesDespite the above, other financial organizations such as A.M. Best have been highlighting the fact that the insurance industry, and within it, the specialized segment of annuities, may, in fact, be set for a stable journey in 2023. The organization's market segment report published in November 2022 showed that it was maintaining its Stable outlook for the US life/annuity segment, the US health insurance industry, the global reinsurance segment, and the US commercial lines segment. A.M. Best also maintained a Positive outlook for the delegated underwriting authority enterprises market.This outlook on different segments within the insurance industry highlights that all may not be lost for the industry. It is based on many factors. These include record annuity sales growth of 22% in the US in the second quarter of 2022, improvements in global reinsurance rates compared to their state in 2018, sustained strong underwriting performance during the COVID-19 pandemic and economic volatility, and rising cyber-focused investments during 2022 driving the ability of delegated underwriting authority enterprises to capitalize on their expertise and advanced tech to strengthen their distribution channels. On this last factor, it is to be noted that the report quoted a figure of nearly $1 billion being poured into cyber-focused investments between January and November 2022.The above factors combined paint a picture that implies that while the insurance industry is certainly not breezing through its difficulties, there remains hope for this sector just yet. However, safety and caution must be exercised when venturing into this space. In light of this, we have compiled a list of annuity companies, in particular, to avoid if you are a customer looking for a company with immense financial health.10 Annuity Companies To Avoidaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashOur MethodologyTo select the annuity companies for our list, we used the Life Insurer Financial Report published in 2022 to pick out companies with A.M. Best ratings of B++ and below and Comdex scores of under 50. A.M. Best ratings include A++ (Superior), A+ (Superior), A (Excellent), A- (Excellent), B++ (Very Good), B+ (Good), B, B-, C++, C+, C, C-, D (all Vulnerable), E (Under State Supervision), F (In Liquidation), and S (Rating Suspended). These ratings highlight the financial strength of the company, with ratings of B++ and below indicating that the company's financial strength falls short, especially in comparison to its competitors.The Comdex Score is a ranking from 1-100 and represents a composite score of all ratings assigned by rating agencies. A Comdex score of 49 would mean that the company in question is ranked higher than 48% of all insurance companies. The higher a company's Comdex score, the better it is considered to be. We have thus ranked these companies based on their A.M. Best ratings and Comdex scores, from the highest to the lowest in both metrics.Annuity Companies To Avoid10. CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance CompanyAM Best Rating: B++Comdex Score: 49CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company is a company that was founded in 1978. It falls under the wing of Crestline Assurance Holdings LLC. The company is based in Fort Worth, Texas.CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company offers flexible retirement solutions and high-value retirement savings tools. It provides clients with single premium tax-deferred annuities with interest rates over a time frame of one to five years, among more. While this company's A.M. Best rating of B++ and Comdex score of 49 show that it's doing alright financially, for those looking to have an ironclad annuity and insurance provider, this company may not be the right pick.Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) would be preferred alternatives for those looking for excellent insurance companies.9. Talcott Resolution Life Insurance CompanyAM Best Rating: B++Comdex Score: 47Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company is an insurance company founded in 1902 and based in Windsor, Connecticut. Its parent organization is TR RE, Ltd.The company claims to oversee and administer about one million contracts and $90 billion in pro-forma assets under management. Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company has a B++ rating at A.M. Best, a BBB (Good) rating at S&amp;P, and a Baa3 (Adequate) rating at Moody's. Like the company above, these ratings and the Comdex score of 47 imply that the company's financial health is merely adequate at the moment, so it is not a very strong contender within the annuity space compared to its competitors.8. Talcott Resolution L&amp;A Insurance CompanyAM Best Rating: B++Comdex Score: 47Talcott Resolution L&amp;A Insurance Company is part of the Talcott Financial Group, like Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company above.

Best, a BBB (Good) rating at S&amp;P, and a Baa3 (Adequate) rating at Moody's alongside a Comdex score of 47, implying its financial health is in the same condition as the company before it.7.

The company was founded in 1966.EquiTrust Life Insurance Company provides competitive, client-friendly annuity and life insurance products through its network of independent sales representatives.

19,0b962d9e-c059-3a8c-8c00-c56d5ed48ccf,MET,2023-06-24,15 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-auto-insurance-companies-201334116.html,1687551214,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'ALL', 'MET', 'KMPR', 'TRV']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 largest auto insurance companies in the US. To skip our industry discussion and see the 5 largest companies, you can go directly to go to 5 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The US.The significant technological advances being made in the automobile industry, namely the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, are bound to have an impact on another sector: the auto insurance sector. These changes result in different customer needs and demands, which means that auto insurers will have to adapt to the times if they wish to stay relevant in this modern technological era.Potential Growth For The Auto Insurance SectorAccording to Ernst &amp; Young, evolving mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations are now beginning to challenge the legacy business models put forth by auto insurance companies. These challenges are forcing these companies to change the way they work and the type of work they do if they wish to adapt to a shrinking market size. Ernst &amp; Young believes that by 2035, the changes felt in mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations will shrink the market available to auto insurance companies by 31%. They are also expected to bring in newer competition, especially against older and more traditional insurers, while also transforming the way insurance is distributed, underwritten, and serviced.In light of these factors, financial professionals today see insurance companies, and even companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), that offer a diverse range of insurance products, as going through a radical transformation during the next few years. Ernst &amp; Young recommends that insurance carriers should begin to act now and fast to build business-to-business (B2B) distribution partnerships while also maximizing the benefits of telematics for their own gain.Changing Trends In The Automobile and Auto Insurance SectorsAccording to an article published by McKinsey in September, three major technologies will change the way the auto insurance sector operates in the next few years. These technologies, namely autonomous driving, connectivity, and embedded telematics, are said to be responsible for shaping the future of mobility and global auto insurance. McKinsey believes that not only will these technologies result in changing dynamics within the auto insurance industry, but they will also result in the same for original equipment manufacturers.Story continuesThe impact of these new technologies on original equipment manufacturers relates to the increased access these companies will have to their customers and to vehicle data. This increased access also means that disintermediate insurers would be placed at a disadvantage in comparison to original equipment manufacturers. However, the article also notes that those insurance companies that manage to capitalize on insurance based on real-time vehicle usage can also be at a significant advantage if they play their cards right.It cannot be disputed that new technologies that have made autonomous driving a real-life possibility today will have a significant impact on the auto insurance sector, and this impact may not be entirely positive. With more people opting for autonomous or self-driving cars, the frequency of car accidents is expected to decrease drastically. In light of this development, auto insurance is beginning to move towards becoming a ""predict and prevent"" product, according to the McKinsey article. Another key point from the article that is worth noting is that with the rise of autonomous vehicles, insurance liability is also being shifted from human operators to commercial parties that are responsible for the manufacture of autonomous vehicles and their technology.All of the above shows only the beginning of the impact the auto insurance industry is bound to feel in the face of these new technological advancements. The way these advancements affect the sector is bound to show within the general performance of the property and casualty insurance sector at large. This is a sector that we have covered in another article before, where we highlight current dynamics within the sector and the growth it has been exhibiting. It is worth noting that despite skepticism surrounding the auto insurance industry today in light of the changing dynamics we have mentioned above, there is also a significant degree of widespread optimism among the financial public when it comes to the property and casualty insurance sector. Keeping this in mind, we felt that it would be worth compiling a list of the biggest auto insurance companies in the US today.15 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The USPhoto by carlos aranda on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo select the companies for our list below, we decided to pick market share in the auto insurance market as a ranking criterion.

24,f91dd042-446e-3dc7-924b-17ffc61761f5,O,2023-06-24,Middle East Oil Prices Soar Amid Chinese Trading Frenzy,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-east-oil-prices-soar-210000458.html,1687554000,STORY,"['CL=F', 'GC=F']","[At a time when global recession concerns have depressed global oil prices to pre-Ukraine war levels, prices of Middle Eastern oil have skyrocketed on soaring demand from Asian refiners in China to Japan as the market takes stock of heavy trading by the industry’s biggest names this month.According to Bloomberg, spot differentials for August-loading Oman crude have jumped to more than $2 a barrel against the Dubai benchmark as of Wednesday, compared with 60-70 cents last week; premiums for Abu Dhabi’s Murban grade also rose - it’s rare for spot differentials to move more than 10-to-20 cents a barrel between days and deals.The soaring regional prices have been underpinned by Asian refiners snapping up barrels over the past couple of days, including China’s Rongsheng Petrochemical, Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical and processors in Japan and Thailand, according to traders. A surge in activity on a normally sedate Middle Eastern crude-trading window has also sparked the interest of market participants.For those asking where is all that pent up oil demand out of a post-covid China, here is your answer: Unipec - a unit of China’s top refiner Sinopec - TotalEnergies SE and Shell Plc have been going head-to-head with aggressive bids and offers of Dubai crude partial contracts on the so-called Platts trading window this month, an activity that goes into pricing a benchmark of the same name.As Bloomberg explains, cargoes of crude including Oman, Murban and other Middle Eastern grades can be delivered from seller to buyer following the transaction of a set number of Dubai partials. Shipments are typically 500,000 barrels and Oman is one of the easiest to handle due to its high export volume and large pool of buyers and sellers.So far this month, almost 40 Oman cargoes and two Upper Zakum shipments from the United Arab Emirates have been delivered, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which is the most activity seen on the Platts window in years.Story continuesHowever, the number of Oman shipments equates to almost 70% of the grade’s exported volume in recent months. That’s led traders to consider whether sellers on the Platts window such as Unipec may curtail offers should physical cargoes become scarce. These concerns have contributed to a rise in prices, and may give room for more increases if sellers find it hard to get their hands on window-deliverable cargoes.The sharp increase in sentiment (and price) is a dramatic turnaround from earlier in the month when traders were unsure about the market’s direction following contrasting trading on the window. Companies may also actively buy and sell on the window due to associated positions in Brent and Dubai paper markets.The backwardation in prompt Dubai swaps also strengthened to the widest in six weeks Wednesday, while the premium of London’s Brent to the Middle Eastern benchmark — also known as Brent-Dubai EFS — was narrow at under $1 a barrel. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia surprised the market with additional output cuts that were followed by a spike in official prices to all regions.Bloomberg notes that last month cargoes of Oman, Upper Zakum and Murban crude for July loading were transacted for Europe and the US, shipments considered unusual, as Asian demand was soft at the time but that has since reversed notably. A US major sold Murban into the US west coast, traders said, while a trading company supplied Upper Zakum to Italy.Western buyers considered spot Middle Eastern crude as affordable due to muted demand from Asia, where many refiners were undergoing seasonally planned maintenance work on plants, according to traders.

That put the total count down about 24 rigs in the last month and down 12% year-over-year.U.S. oil futures were down about 14% so far this year after gaining about 7% in 2022. U.S. gas futures, meanwhile, have plunged about 41% so far this year after rising about 20% last year.The massive drop in gas prices has already caused some exploration and production companies, including Chesapeake Energy Corp, Southwestern Energy Co and Comstock Resources Inc, to announce plans to reduce production by cutting some rigs - especially in the Haynesville shale in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.Despite some plans to lower rig counts, the independent exploration and production companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen were on track to boost spending by about 19% in 2023 versus 2022 after increasing spending about 40% in 2022 and 4% in 2021.That increased spending will help keep U.S. crude production on track to rise from 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 to 12.6 million bpd in 2023 and 12.8 million bpd in 2024, according to projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in June. That compares with a record 12.3 million bpd in 2019.U.S. gas production, meanwhile, was on track to rise from a record 98.13 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2022 to 102.74 bcfd in 2023 and 103.04 bcfd in 2024, according to EIA's projection.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

The company has long been manufacturing this harmful substance, which can cause serious ailments like cancer. Following this news, shares of the company gained 5% in after-market trading on Jun 22.As part of the settlement, 3M will provide funding of up to $12.5 billion to PWS over a period of 13 years for testing the presence of PFAS and treating it. Upon receiving court approval, the settlement will free MMM from any claims associated with the usage of PFAS in drinking water.With this agreement, 3M expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023, which will be presented as an adjustment for special items.3M Company Price3M Company Price3M Company price | 3M Company QuoteAmong the several lawsuits 3M is facing, this agreement will put to rest a claim by Stuart, FL, which alleged 3M of manufacturing firefighting foams containing PFAS, despite knowing how harmful the chemical was. The city has been seeking more than $100 million from 3M for water filtration and soil remediation.Nevertheless, the company continues to be embroiled in thousands of other PFAS-related lawsuits. Amid regulatory pressure to restrict the use of PFAS, in December 2022, 3M announced that it would cease manufacturing PFAS and discontinue its use in products by the end of 2025.

The report identifies nearly 70 priority energy system challenges requiring R&amp;D to achieve PG&amp;E's True North Strategy, which comprises three major components: rebuilding trust and delivering excellent service for customers; architecting a decarbonized, safe, and reliable energy system; and enabling these outcomes by building strong foundational capabilities.PG&amp;E will leverage the report to engage with researchers, industry, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and academia to identify novel technologies and solutions across the electric and gas systems focused on supply and load management, integrated grid planning, electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid applications, wildfire mitigation, undergrounding, and gas system decarbonization.""PG&amp;E has a rich history of accelerating innovation, and we are more committed than ever to working with the best and the brightest to advance our clean energy future and solve some of the most challenging issues facing the energy system today,"" said Jason Glickman, Executive Vice President, Engineering, Planning &amp; Strategy, PG&amp;E. ""Our new R&amp;D Strategy Initiative provides insights needed for working more collaboratively and effectively with innovators to advance a wide range of bold, innovative technologies that will enhance the customer experience, improve grid resilience, and ensure that a healthy environment and safe, carbon-neutral energy system is the reality for all Californians.""To advance these goals, PG&amp;E, through the new initiative, will proactively identify and utilize emerging technologies that have successfully progressed out of the foundational research phase, are ready to pilot or deploy near-term and have a path to commercialization at scale.Story continuesInnovation Summit 2023 on July 25 and Pitch Fest in SeptemberThrough the R&amp;D Strategy Report, developed in collaboration with ADL Ventures, an energy and climate tech consultancy, PG&amp;E is sharing with the energy industry, technology, and start-up communities key insights around challenges the company is committed to solving with breakthrough thinking and radical collaboration. As next steps in bringing this new R&amp;D Strategy Initiative to life, PG&amp;E will host two events this year:The PG&amp;E Innovation Summit 2023 on July 25 leverages the R&amp;D Strategy Report to bring together entrepreneurs, national labs, thought leaders, policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders to engage directly with PG&amp;E leaders and subject-matter experts about the current state and future needs of the energy system. This inaugural event will include energy industry keynote speakers (to be announced) and deep dive breakout sessions around the key R&amp;D themes outlined in the report. The one-day event will take place in-person in San Ramon and will be hosted by Jason Glickman and Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer of PG&amp;E Corporation. There will be a virtual attendance option inclusive of the breakout sessions.The Innovation Pitch Fest 2023 in September will follow the technology and solution application and selection process that opens on July 25. Through that process, select applicants will be invited to pitch their technologies or solutions at the Innovation Pitch Fest 2023 to PG&amp;E management, key decisionmakers and subject-matter experts. Successful pitches have the potential to lead to a range of follow-on engagements with PG&amp;E, including partnership and grant opportunities, and influence over the scoping of upcoming Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) 4 projects with a total budget of $83 million. PG&amp;E is actively developing its portfolio of EPIC 4 projects around the key themes outlined in the R&amp;D Strategy Report and anticipates launching projects by the first quarter of 2024, pending final program approval by the California Public Utilities Commission.R&amp;D Strategy Initiative Focus AreasSupply and Load Management – PG&amp;E aspires to play an important role in expanding load management capabilities across all levels of the grid and seeks to partner with the innovation community to make comprehensive load management a core capability. On the supply side, PG&amp;E seeks to integrate promising new forms of next-generation energy supply and storage technologies at the lowest capital cost and highest-value locations to deliver the clean, affordable, and resilient grid of the future.Integrated Grid Planning – Accommodating the pace and scale of anticipated load growth will require the ability to connect new loads more efficiently to the electric system while optimizing transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) upgrades. PG&amp;E seeks to identify new tools and technologies that reduce lead times for service upgrades and new service connections, safely increase the flexibility and/or thermal rating of grid assets, improve power quality on the T&amp;D system or otherwise increase the efficiency of T&amp;D assets on the grid.Electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid applications – PG&amp;E aims to reduce the costs and shorten the timelines associated with charging installation upgrades through low-cost technologies that can be implemented at scale or solutions that avoid electrical upgrades altogether. Additionally, enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) infrastructure and making full use of EVs as grid assets can create opportunities to reduce the cost of ownership and unlock novel value streams that could be leveraged to better serve customers and the grid and generate incremental revenue.Wildfire mitigation – PG&amp;E is continually looking for the most cutting-edge technologies and aggressive methods to mitigate wildfire risk while minimizing customer impacts. Improved monitoring, management, and operation of assets–along with optimized forest management–can help end catastrophic wildfires while enhancing PG&amp;E's ability to deliver affordable and reliable electricity.Undergrounding – PG&amp;E seeks to increase the speed, efficiency, and predictability of undergrounding. The goal is to identify novel technologies that can help PG&amp;E mitigate risk quickly while reducing the cycle time and cost of undergrounding projects.Decarbonizing the gas system – PG&amp;E's vision is to evolve the gas system to be an affordable, safe, and reliable net zero energy delivery platform. To make the transition, PG&amp;E expects a diverse mix of resources to be available—from broad electrification to cleaner fuels such as renewable natural gas and hydrogen to nature-based solutions and carbon capture, storage, and utilization.Read the R&amp;D Strategy Report, find Innovation Summit details and registration information, and learn more about the Innovation Pitch Fest at www.pge.com/innovation.About PG&amp;EPG&amp;E, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Call of Duty will remain available on rival Sony Corp’s PlayStation devices, countering the US Federal Trade Commission’s claim that the purchase would thwart competition in the console gaming market.Most Read from BloombergPutin Claims He’s Back in Control. Russia’s Elite Isn’t SureQatar Group Now Confident of Winning Manchester United RaceSwitzerland Blocks Sale of Leopard 1 Tanks Bound for UkraineUBS Preparing to Cut Over Half of Credit Suisse WorkforceSweden Police Give Permit to Koran Burning Near Stockholm MosqueUS District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on Friday asked Phil Spencer, who heads Microsoft Gaming, to confirm that Microsoft won’t exclude the popular shooter game from consoles offered by its top competitor Sony.Spencer raised his hand ceremoniously and said: “My commitment is, my testimony is, we will continue to ship future versions of Call of Duty on Sony’s PlayStation.” As long as Sony would allow that, he added. He also said that he would keep the game on future versions of the PlayStation.Spencer is among Microsoft executives defending the planned purchase in a five-day court hearing that began Thursday. The FTC is seeking to temporarily halt the transaction while its legal challenge to the acquisition is pending. His promise under oath could hurt FTC’s attempt to show that the deal would reduce competition in the console gaming market.The blockbuster deal would vault Microsoft to the No. 3 position in the global games market after Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Sony. The deal that has a closure deadline of July 18 could be wrecked if Corley rules in the agency’s favor.Microsoft claims its incentive in buying Activision is to gain a foothold in the lucrative mobile gaming market. “This deal has nothing to do with increasing” Microsoft Xbox’s share in the console market, Spencer testified. The executive who sported a dark gray suit and tie told the judge he plans to be in the courtroom during the entire hearing that’s set to end June 29.Story continuesThe FTC has also argued that the deal would hurt competition in markets for game subscriptions and games that can be streamed through cloud technology. Agency lawyer James Weingarten said in his opening statement Thursday that the deal had nothing to do with Microsoft trying to challenge Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.’s “duopoly” in the mobile market.When questioned by Microsoft’s attorney Beth Wilkinson, Spencer tried to convey the extent of Microsoft’s interest in pursuing the mobile gaming market by divulging that the company made a bid for smartphone game maker Zynga. But Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. bought the Farmville creator, he said, referring to Take-Two’s $11 billion acquisition of Zynga announced last year.Spencer also revealed that the “impetus” behind Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media Inc. in 2020 was to stop the video game creator from offering its Starfield role-playing game exclusively to Sony’s PlayStation. “We can’t be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on our content ownership,” he said.Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick are expected to testify before the hearing ends next week.The case is Federal Trade Commission v.

Axios Global Technology Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for U.S.-India trade relations and geopolitical concerns, including competition with China.Video Transcript- Well, tech giants are betting big on India as tensions with China remain high, and they're taking advantage of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit this week following last night's state dinner. Some of those top names within the tech community spending their morning at the White House at a meeting with President Biden, as well as Prime Minister Modi. Apple's Tim Cook, Sam Altman from OpenAI, and CEO Lisa Hsu of AMD, CEO Microsoft Satya Nadella, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all among the guest list.Joining us now is Axios Global tech correspondent, Ryan Heath. And Ryan, so much of this conversation has been framed in the context of China, which certainly makes sense given that a lot of these tech companies are looking to diversify outside of China. But how big is the opportunity in India really?RYAN HEATH: It's massive. And it's been going on for a long time. This isn't just a safety net strategy for dealing with the tension in China. So companies like IBM have had between a third and half of their workforce based in India for the last decade now. And obviously, these roots go into very deep territory.When you think about the millions of Indian students that have studied at American universities, many of them return home. So you've got a lot of deep links, a lot of very sophisticated universities and systems that the Indian government already operates. So there's a lot of opportunity for Americans to tap into. There's a lot of talent that the American companies can use, either in India or they can import people over to the United States. And there really is a lot of opportunity here. And the situation in China means it's all the more important. But there's a very strong foundation to build on.Story continues- Ryan, excuse me. Julie here. Let's talk about the potential risks then of operating in India because accompanying Prime Minister Modi's visit here to the United States has also been discussion of the democratic record there, his human rights record, his record on freedom of journalists in the country. None of them are particularly stellar. And then you have Jack Dorsey, formerly of Twitter, of course, talking about some curbs on Twitter from the Indian government. So what are these companies really have to keep aware of?RYAN HEATH: Well, there's a whole suite of issues here. So let's start with some of the tech that the Indian government uses. It doesn't do it with the same guardrails that we would expect in the US or in particular, in the European Union. It's very attractive if you're a technologist to say, hey, I get to work with a billion biometric records. But if you don't have guardrails in place, that can really blow up in your face or in the face of the people whose records you're in charge of maintaining.Then you've got the democracy situation. So the Indian government did threaten to shut down Twitter. They do demand that accounts that are critical of them be removed or be censored. So you're going to have to tangle with the Indian government. And what sounds nice at a White House state dinner is a lot more uncomfortable when you have those regulators knocking on your door and telling you you might be kicked out of the country if you don't comply. So there's that level of difficulty there.Then you've got the situation where most workers in India just really aren't paid what workers in America are paid. That doesn't mean these are bad jobs. But you've got a lot of human rights watchdogs, a lot of people looking through the ESG reports of a given company. And they're going to want to know, are these sweatshops? What are the conditions of all of these workers who are manually labeling this data? The ones that are making AI seem really human, there's a bunch of humans being paid $2 an hour to do that work.So you're going to have to manage a lot of reputational issues if you dive in to India. At the same time, the rewards are pretty big if you can pull it off.- Ryan, what about the issue of tech transfers? I mean, this is the Indian government essentially saying, look, we'll welcome you, and we'll give you access into our massive market, but we want something in exchange.RYAN HEATH: Yeah. So this is a pretty standard Indian play. And it seems a bit more reasonable now when you look at these global subsidy races that we've been seeing around chips and around other key strategic, critical minerals and other exports in the technology sector. But for a long time, this was India being on the fringe, demanding things that weren't very realistic. And their attitude there is we've been exploited for centuries by Western powers. It's time to get something back.And what it meant is that India just didn't really sign a lot of free trade deals. They didn't enjoy the economic growth that a more open Chinese economy enjoyed. But now that the US needs India, and the Modi government knows it, they know that India is essential as a hedge against China, they can really push these demands. And they were able to sign deals on military jets and co-production between GE and Hindustan Aeronautics. They've done a drone deal. They're going to do more in terms of ship repairs outside the tech sector but still pretty strategically important. So the Indians are squeezing something out of the Biden administration here. So it's working for them.- How reliable partner do you think India is for the US? I mean, Julie sort of listed off some of the concerns around human rights. There's those who argue, look, India hasn't even condemned Russia for the attack of Ukraine. I mean, there's a lot of question marks where the US and India don't see eye to eye. And yet, if you look at the state visit, the public statements that have come out so far, you'd think they're really on the same page. Are they a reliable partner for the US?RYAN HEATH: Sometimes, you don't get to choose your partners. So I would say that they're not the most reliable partner, but they're the partner that the US has been able to get to the table. So it's absolutely the case that the reason why we haven't seen more weapons sales and other military equipment in the past is because India's relied on Russia for that. The US frankly hasn't fully trusted India with intelligence and with some of that technology.They were able to do a civilian nuclear deal under the Bush administration, and there were big hopes around that. And it didn't really work out as well as planned. So if you talk to people in the Bush administration or other defense insiders like I've been doing over the last week, they honestly don't fully trust India. At the same time, the only way to build trust is to do some of these deals and inch it forward.So I think when you look in the context of China and the need for as many allies and partners in the region as possible, we have to work with India. I was born in Australia. Australia has to work with India inside this quad framework as well. So it's a difficult relationship, but they've got to keep trying because the alternative is that you allow China to dominate. And that in most people's opinion is the worst outcome.- Axios Global tech correspondent, Ryan Heath. Appreciate you joining us today. Thanks so much.RYAN HEATH: Thank you.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of special dividend stocks and the history of special dividends, and go directly to read 5 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2023. Special dividends are one-time cash payments made by a company to its shareholders, in addition to the regular dividends they may receive. Special dividends are mainly paid when companies generate extra cash from occasional events, such as the sale of assets or a significant increase in profits. Rather than retaining the cash for future investments or acquisitions, the company decides to distribute it to shareholders.The practice of issuing special dividends has been observed throughout history and is not a recent phenomenon. According to a report by the Journal of Financial Economics, special dividends were once commonly paid by only NYSE companies. During the 1940s, 61.7% of the companies that paid dividends on the NYSE gave out special dividends, compared with 45.8% in the 1950s. Another report by New York University highlighted that in the last quarter of 2012, non-fund companies listed on various stock exchanges announced a significant number of special dividends. Specifically, in October, there were 54 special dividends, compared with 228 and 483 in November and December, respectively.Among these special dividends paid in the past, the most popular one was in 2004, when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a special dividend of $3 per share, a stark contrast to its regular dividend of $0.04 per share. This special dividend resulted in a massive payout totaling around $32 billion. The decision was attributed to the significant cash reserves the company had accumulated over the years. Similarly, in 2017, Red Bull had a fantastic year in terms of sales, selling over 6 billion cans of its popular energy drink. As a result, the company decided to share its success with shareholders by distributing 500 million euros ($617.3 million) in a special dividend.Story continuesMany companies in the US also paid special dividends last year, particularly upstream oil corporations such as Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). The energy sector paid record dividends in 2022, especially through special payments and capital return payments, as reported by S&amp;P Global. Canadian companies also distributed a combined $14.55 per share in special dividends last year, up 18% from 2021. The trend is likely to continue this year as well as global dividends reached their record high of $326.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023, mainly driven by special payments. Janus Henderson's report highlighted that global special dividends amounted to over $28.8 billion, of which $9.8 billion came from US companies.In times of financial instability, investors often turn to dividend stocks to generate regular income.

To skip our detailed analysis of the Metaverse and its advancements, go directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Invest In.While the idea of a real-life ""Matrix"" may appear to belong solely to the realm of science fiction, it is important to remember that notions such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and even the internet itself were once deemed fantastical concepts too. The metaverse, a digital sphere still in its early evolution, is an immersive three-dimensional universe that has become a hot topic in the world of technology. Individuals within the metaverse engage in virtual environments and forge connections with others in the digital realm. Following Facebook's name change to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), there was a staggering surge of 7,200% in internet searches for the term 'metaverse'. Once individuals grasp the concept, a significant majority wholeheartedly embrace it: according to recent research conducted by McKinsey, around 60% of consumers express excitement about the metaverse's potential to transform everyday activities such as shopping, dating, and exercising.According to a report by Precedence Research, the global metaverse market accounted for $68.49 billion in 2022 and it is estimated to surpass around $1.3 trillion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 44.5% during the forecast period 2022 to 2030. While the potential impact of the metaverse varies across industries, it holds implications for all of them. McKinsey, for example, estimates that it may have a market impact of between $2 trillion and $2.6 trillion on e-commerce by 2030. Similarly, an impact of $180 billion to $270 billion on the academic virtual learning market is expected, while a $108 billion to $125 billion impact is anticipated on the gaming market.Overall, this industry is poised to grow with more companies planning to get involved. The technologies that are involved with the metaverse can include virtual reality (VR), characterized by persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you are not playing, as well as augmented reality (AR) that combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the many that are making strides in the space and could be at the forefront of the metaverse's massive opportunity.

(NASDAQ:TTWO) has faced weakness in the mobile gaming market, in addition to game-launching delays. The company reported underwhelming quarterly results in Q4 and lowered its full-year guidance. After reexamining our long-term thesis, we decided to exit our position in favor of more attractive opportunities.”Much like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is an attractive stock for investors that are looking to invest in the metaverse.8. Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is an American multinational software corporation that makes software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries.

(NASDAQ:ADSK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at a specific example. One of our portfolio companies is Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), a construction/engineering/architecture software business with an incredible moat. Our cost basis on the stock is $230. Shares traded as high as $340 in 2021 but today are down around $200. With this declining share price, Autodesk management has been able to take the healthy free cash flow it generates and retire some of its shares outstanding at an accelerated rate.At the beginning of 2022, Autodesk had approximately 220 million shares outstanding. Today, that number is down to around 216 million, and we expect this number to continue to drop over the next few years as the company ramps up its free cash flow generation. This reduction in share count will juice growth in free cash flow per share, which will determine what returns we get owning Autodesk over the long haul. The lower the stock drops, the faster Autodesk’s share count drops, all else equal.”7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Involved in the creation of semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology, the company owns patents critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA mobile communications standards.Earlier in September 2022, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) joined forces with Telefónica in a collaborative effort to fortify their leadership in the future of XR (Extended Reality) and the Metaverse.

The agreement encompasses the exploration of shared commercial prospects as well as the introduction of XR/Metaverse products and services.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 69 hedge funds were bullish on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM, compared to 82 funds in the earlier quarter.Earlier this May, Canaccord maintained a Buy rating on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) with a $152 price target. The firm appreciated the company’s execution of its diversification growth strategy.Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was volatile during the quarter but moved higher in March. Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), originally called Adobe Systems Incorporated, is an American multinational computer software company known for its multimedia and creativity software products, including Photoshop, Acrobat Reader, and Creative Cloud. This past year, Adobe, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) released its 3D Capture tool that is designed to make it easier to create three-dimensional digital objects for marketing campaigns, video games and the metaverse.On June 16, Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI reaffirmed an Outperform rating on shares of Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE), with collective stakes worth $7.3 billion, compared to 99 funds in the prior quarter worth $8.3 billion.Polen Capital made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable.

In the past year, the stock lost 14.5% against the industry’s 5.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s discuss the factors that might continue to take a toll on the firm.Soft Industry Trend: Sysco experienced soft macroeconomic trends in March, including soft traffic. This put pressure on the company’s volumes, which, in turn, affected sales. Despite improvement, soft industry trends are likely to linger in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which might affect its performance.Steep Costs and Expenses: The company has been witnessing product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 4.9%, measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy and frozen categories.In the same period, its cost of sales and operating expenses recorded increases of 11.2% and 8.7%, respectively. Sysco expects low single-digit inflation in the fiscal fourth quarter. Escalation in operating costs and expenses, if not controlled, might continue to affect SYY’s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.Stiff Competition: Sysco operates in a highly fragmented and competitive foodservice distribution industry. Thus, the company has been subject to competition from several local, regional and multi-regional distributors. The company has not been able to undertake effective pricing actions, despite rising input costs, due to the volatile and price-sensitive demand for its food-away-from-home products. In addition, rising competition from commercial wholesale markets, which have a lower cost structure, has been creating pricing pressure and remains a threat to its margins.Currency Woes: Given its widespread presence in international markets, Sysco is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. In the fiscal third quarter, the company’s International Foodservice operations contributed 17.7% of its total revenues. However, in the quarter, foreign exchange headwinds had an adverse impact of 1.2% and 1.3% on the overall top line and gross profit, respectively. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress SYY's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Southbound Estimate Trend: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 earnings have been revised down by 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Ingredion Incorporated INGR, Nomad Foods Limited NOMD and Conagra Brands, Inc.

59,3a6ce40b-3054-3eca-a536-a6143aeee0c6,ADM,2023-06-24,5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Monitor in the Current Scenario,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-broker-friendly-stocks-monitor-120000794.html,1687521600,STORY,"['ADM', 'ABM', 'BFH', 'CLF']","[That inflation is showing signs of easing is definitely a welcome sign as far as the U.S. economy is concerned. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index increased 4% year over year in May. The increase was not only lower than expected but also below April’s reading. Further good news came in when the Producer Price Index reading revealed that the decline in producer prices for the month of May was more than expected. With inflation woes subsiding, consumer sentiment in the United States is on the mend. The stunning job growth witnessed in May is a further positive as far as economic health is concerned.Investors will no doubt want to take advantage of this brightening scenario. One way to do so would be to follow broker advice and keep broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Bread Financial BFH, ABM Industries ABM, Cleveland-Cliffs CLF and Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM in one’s watchlist.Why Should You Pay Heed to Broker Advice?As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to detailed information on a company. Also, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. Naturally, their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.Given this extensive know-how, brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing. They are believed to be equipped with thorough knowledge and a clear insight into the complexities associated with the investment world. Paying heed to such well-researched information is, therefore, desirable for investors to avoid an unfortunate scenario where one’s hard-earned money invested in stock markets goes down the drain.Story continuesWinning StrategyThe above write-up therefore suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward revisions of earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is included. The price/sales ratio takes care of a company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines: It is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high operating costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 12.9% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bread Financial: Based in Columbus, OH, the company continues to benefit from data-driven marketing strategies. Solid receivables growth in Card Services should drive its top line. Acquisitions and divestitures will aid the company in growing inorganically and expanding its international footprint.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BFH’s 2023 earnings has been revised 24.4% upward. Bread Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.ABM Industries: This integrated facility solutions provider's multi-year comprehensive strategic plan, ELEVATE, focuses on providing clients with offerings that enhance transparency and efficiency, developing its own talent management system capabilities, expanding data usage and modernizing the digital ecosystem.ABM has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters (reporting in-line earnings in the remaining quarter). ABM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Cleveland-Cliffs: It is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 4.3% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Archer Daniels: This Chicago, IL-based agricultural product company’s leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials has been a key contributor to its momentum. Its focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a significant growth driver. Solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations have been driving growth.ADM outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the past four quarters by an average of 23.44%.

67,2434c6f5-2e35-3167-8fcc-08e8f3cbff6b,PM,2023-06-24,Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-130007239.html,1687525207,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned +5.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Tobacco industry, to which Philip Morris belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate of $8.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $35.24 billion and $37.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GS is making diligent efforts to refocus its business on core strengths and reduce its consumer banking footprint.Inorganic growth efforts will diversify its fee revenue base while capital deployment activities seem sustainable, given a solid liquidity position.  However, sluggish capital market activity is likely to impede trading revenues in the near term. Also, GS’ bottom line has been affected in the past few years by its rising cost base.Specifically, the company is refocusing its business on its core strengths of investment baking (IB) and trading while reducing its consumer banking footprint. In line with this, in April 2023, the company announced it is initiating a process to explore the sale of GreenSky. Also, Goldman aims to cease unsecured loan offerings to consumers through Marcus. In the first quarter of 2023, the firm sold $1 billion of Marcus loans.Focus on IB business expansion is a strategic fit given Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As. Moreover, robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and the company’s decent investment banking backlog are positives. While IB fees are expected to decline in 2023 owing to a global deal slump, the same is projected to increase 11.6% in 2024.Goldman is making efforts to diversify its business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings. These are underlined by the buyout of Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners and robo-advisor NextCapital, among others. Through such efforts, the company has positioned itself as one of the top five active asset managers globally.Also, it enjoys decent earnings strength, a steady capital position and a solid credit profile. This has enabled it to consistently enhance shareholders’ value with steady capital deployment activities.GS has a $30-billion share repurchase program in place. Also, in July 2022, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend by 25%. Story continuesHowever, expenses saw a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% in 2022, with the uptrend continuing in first-quarter 2023. Investments in technology and market development expenses for business expansion will keep the expense trend volatile in the upcoming period. For 2023 and 2024, expenses are expected to rise 1.2% and 4.9%, respectively.Amid increasing volatility due to an evolving macroeconomic backdrop, geopolitical concerns, inflation and regional banking collapses, Goldman might see limited market-making opportunities in the Global Banking and Markets division. GS expects trading revenues to decline 25% year over year in second-quarter 2023 due to sluggish capital market activity, and muted equities and fixed-income activity levels compared with the year-ago period.Over the past six months, shares of GS have declined 7.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 11.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

76,0f0299d5-7a7e-35af-9cf8-aa6db73ba8b5,MAT,2023-06-24,Barbie movie a 'catalyst for future monetization' of the brand: Mattel COO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/barbie-movie-catalyst-future-monetization-214726852.html,1687556846.0,VIDEO,['MAT'],"[Buzz has been building around the upcoming Barbie movie. But according to Mattel President and COO Richard Dickson, it's just the beginning. In an interview with Yahoo Finance at the 2023 Cannes Lions International Festival, Dickson explains how the film will help Mattel ""unlock the value"" of the Barbie brand.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: All right. Joining us now is Mattel CEO Richard Dixon. Richard, good to see you here in person. For a change, last time I talked to you, I was in my kitchen during the pandemic.RICHARD DIXON: Yeah. You were in your kitchen. I think I was probably somewhere else, not in my kitchen, but I think that was our wrap last.BRIAN SOZZI: Good to see you nonetheless. And lots of eyes on what you're doing with Barbie as the ""Barbie"" movie gets set to premiere. But I think even getting to this point with Barbie, you can't get here without the reinvention that you and your team have driven at this brand. Walk investors through it.RICHARD DIXON: Thank you. And certainly, a nice place to tell the story. The Barbie revitalization has been one of storybook. It's a case study in the making. Our playbook, which we talk a lot about is the methodology that was behind the revitalization. First and foremost, it's about the brand purpose, inspiring the limitless potential of girls.We talk about design-led innovation, which is really about studying our consumer and understanding their wants and needs. And then third, of course, is cultural relevance. I mean, Barbie is a cultural conversation at this point. So we know that's playing back to us in spades. And last is executional excellence. You can have great ideas. You could have, you know, all the, you know, narratives in the world, but if you can't execute it and bring it to market successfully, then there's nothing but ideas.So we're incredibly proud of the work that's been taking place over the last several years to revitalize Barbie, both from a product and marketing perspective and ultimately results are shared. Our performance has been spectacular over the last several years. And so we're resonating, and now we're going to take this to the next level. Obviously, with the ""Barbie"" movie on the cusp of its launch. So we couldn't be more excited.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And we're definitely going to talk about the ""Barbie"" movie because we have a lot of thoughts and we've even seen Sozzi kind of channel Barbie core recently as well. We won't get too into that. But when you think about everywhere Barbie is right now-- Barbie is in the sports car. Barbie is on the beach, but Barbie is also in STEM. She's at NASA. She's also in the science lab.And when you think about the multicultural relevance of Barbie as well, you've really expanded how people think about the Barbie brand. And so where do you take Barbie from here? What does that look like, and what are consumers clamoring for?RICHARD DIXON: Well, I think you really said it. You know, Barbie is everywhere. And where we've evolved, Barbie is far from a identified character into a bigger platform for cultural conversation and inspiration, particularly for girls. To inspire their imaginations, we needed to partner with the very most successful women in the world and honor their careers with special Barbies and expand our career assortment to really inspire girls to imagine their limitless potential.And so part of the brand's methodology has been to work with some of the leading women in the world from a career perspective. Inspire them by creating career dolls, playsets that unlock their imaginations to imagine what's possible. And so the methodology behind our playbook has really extended the brand and all of these multicultural touchpoints that ultimately have been driving our business and also driving the equity value of Barbie.I think what really becomes more interesting as you see the Barbie brand evolve is from a character into a platform and ultimately a franchise. And so from toys to lifestyle product to live experiences, digital gaming, now film, you really start to see the manifestation and the monetization of the power of this incredible franchise.BRIAN SOZZI: How does-- how is Barbie going to play against AI? I came into-- I read a story coming in to this event. Now we have teddy bears that could potentially tell bedtime stories. How is Barbie going to have to change in this age of AI and various robotics?RICHARD DIXON: Yeah. Well, first of all, we are venturing into the digital landscape progressively. I think in order for us to realize the actual potential, we've got to start swinging in these spaces. We had our first foray into virtual collectibles with Barbie as NFTs.We've done them with fashion houses like Balmain to Boss Beauties, which inspires the many different careers in the virtual collectible world. We've got extraordinary partnerships in the virtual gaming community. We've got a mobile partnership with NetEase.So we are actually extending the Barbie brand in the digital playground and intend to be an important digital brand as that community evolves. We look at it more as like extending the playground.BRIAN SOZZI: Did you see the doll itself talking at some point?RICHARD DIXON: I do believe that we will get to a place where Barbie in a character form, whether it's your choice of how you engage in that character or the play pattern itself will have some dialogue. It's inevitable. And I think that's the exciting part of it.Where we're at in the digital playground is it's going to continue to evolve and Barbie's brand ethos is about being culturally relevant. And so we've got to be in that space. It might not all necessarily be as successful as we would like. But eventually, it's going to be a really important part of the Barbie ecosystem.BRAD SMITH: Something on a more serious tone before we get to the more fun tone of the movie, we're in a kind of a discretionary spending downturn right now, where people are really looking across how they're spending in some of the more discretionary categories, whether that's toys or home or appliances.So from the Mattel perspective, when you kind of have those conversations with your partners, what does that look like? And, I guess, from Mattel's perspective as well, what other levers in a time like that can you pull to make sure that the company is still healthy?RICHARD DIXON: During recessions and we've seen it time and time again, you know, Mattel is a storied company. It's eight decades. So we've been through lots of different economic highs and lows and certainly cultural events. Toys is an incredibly resilient category. First and foremost, parents will not deprive their kids of play.And essentially, the value of play express through toys is really a great category to be in particularly during economic challenging times. That being said, the toy industry itself while a good and resilient category still has lots of competition. And there are incredibly innovative companies that we compete with.We have a storied portfolio of very strong franchise brands-- Barbie, Hot Wheels. American Girl, Thomas the Tank, Fisher-Price Magic 8 Ball, Pictionary, Uno, and so forth. So we've got really powerful brands that resonate. And when times are difficult, people resonate with nostalgia, with brands of credibility, and with innovation that prevails. And certainly, the toy industry is well known for innovation. And Mattel, in particular, has a great innovation pipeline.So while challenging, we believe we have a really purposeful portfolio of brands with great innovation that should be resilient during challenging times.BRAD SMITH: Does that mean that you're anticipating a still strong holiday season for toys?RICHARD DIXON: We anticipate as always, Christmas will come. Holidays will come. Toys will be under that tree and under the holiday areas of family. And Mattel will prevail as the leading toy company in the world.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, before the holidays will, in fact, be the release of this ""Barbie"" movie in mid-july. From an investor standpoint, that investor comes onto Yahoo. They do a yahoo.com search and they see all this excitement about this movie. How does that translate into your bottom line? And is it a stock-moving event?RICHARD DIXON: Well, first, I think when you look at the power of what we've created with Barbie, premovie and ultimately, what will be movie and post movie, you have to recognize that this is a brand of cultural importance. And the monetization of that brand certainly proven through toy.The next chapter of that is going to be unlocking the value of this IP through storytelling, whether it's theatrical, television, live action content, gaming, live experiences. All of the different category partnerships that we've created in consumer products where this movie is really a catalyst for future monetization in the consumer product space-- apparel, sporting goods, home accessories.And the other piece that I think is really exciting in the context of unlocking the value, is the multi-generational aspect of it. Clearly the base of our business is younger, right? But the movie is going to be PG-13. We appeal to an older audience, both teen, young adults, moms, glam-mas. And there's somehting--BRAD SMITH: Glam-mas?RICHARD DIXON: Glam-mas.BRAD SMITH: Never heard of that before.RICHARD DIXON: --of course. It's a Barbie grandmas and glam-ma. And you're going to see lots of product offerings in addition to content that is going to be monetizable for the company and exciting for consumers of all ages to engage in the franchise. So lots more room and a long tail that will happen from the movie in terms of the merchandising and monetization plans going forward.BRIAN SOZZI: You know, you and I will be there, what, opening night, maybe?BRAD SMITH: Oh, yeah, I would love to be there.RICHARD DIXON: I hope so. I hope so.BRIAN SOZZI: All right.RICHARD DIXON: It's a hot ticket.BRAD SMITH: It is. All right. Richard Dixon, Mattel CEO. Good to see you as always. We appreciate the time.RICHARD DIXON: Thank you so much. Thanks for being here.BRIAN SOZZI: Guys, back to you.]"

79,8d8babae-0845-3eaf-b2f3-0f418bbb1d75,HOLX,2023-06-24,Abbott (ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Gets Reimbursement in France,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbott-abt-freestyle-libre-2-162800539.html,1687537680,STORY,"['ABT', 'BSX', 'HOLX']","[Abbott Laboratories ABT recently announced that the FreeStyle Libre 2 system's reimbursement coverage has been expanded by the French health authority to cover individuals using basal insulin as part of their diabetic therapy. Prior to this, only those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, requiring strict insulin therapy, were eligible for FreeStyle Libre 2.The latest development, while advancing Abbott’s Diabetes Care business line, facilitates broader access to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.More on ReimbursementFrance is the first nation in Europe to extend national coverage of Abbott's industry-redefining FreeStyle Libre technology to diabetics who take basal insulin. This comes after similar increases in reimbursement coverage for its technology in Japan and the Medicare programme in the United States. This adds an additional 3 million people with diabetes who are qualified to use FreeStyle Libre technology to control their disease.Based on research demonstrating the clinical advantages of utilizing the FreeStyle Libre system among all insulin users, the French reimbursement expansion was approved. According to the Real-World Evidence of FreeStyle Libre (RELIEF) study, a retrospective analysis of the French national claims database, people with Type 2 diabetes using once-daily (basal) insulin significantly reduced their risk of developing acute complications from diabetes. This resulted in a 67% decline in hospitalisations.Significance of Extended ReimbursementIt is worth mentioning that in France, Type 2 diabetes affects more than 90% of diabetics and can cause major issues affecting the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and neurological system if not treated properly. The increased reimbursement makes it possible for more people in France who have diabetes to use the most recent CGM technology, which can help them make wise decisions about their health and way of life.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesThe decision to implement national reimbursement in France is a significant step towards granting persons with diabetes greater access. The benefits of continuous glucose monitoring, which were previously only available to those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and who were undergoing extensive insulin therapy, are now accessible to a broader population of patients thanks to Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2's increased reimbursement.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global diabetes devices market size was valued at $26.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% by 2030.The increasing adoption of insulin delivery devices and rising prevalence of diabetes are supporting market growth. Leading manufacturers are focusing on technological innovations and the development of advanced products to gain a substantial share of the market.Progress Within Diabetes BusinessIn April 2023, Abbott announced thar using its FreeStyle Libre portfolio, the most widely used and reasonably priced continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) in the United States, more Medicare beneficiaries, who are living with diabetes and using insulin, would be eligible for coverage.  A FreeStyle CGM can now be covered by Medicare for diabetics with problematic hypoglycemia, a condition where a person's blood glucose is lower than normal and can cause fainting or unconsciousness.The same month, Abbott announced that the FDA has approved a reader for its FreeStyle Libre 3 integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system, which features the world's smallest, thinnest and most discreet glucose sensor. The FreeStyle Libre 3 reader is a small handheld device that displays real-time glucose readings directly from a small sensor worn on the back of a person's upper arm, allowing them to manage their diabetes quickly and easily by viewing their glucose readings on a large, bright and easy-to-see screen.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 0.8% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 22.3%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its strong diagnostic business are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to data security threats and overdependence on diagnostic tests persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 14.3% compared with a 23.5% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 11.9% growth in the said time frame.The renowned rapid diagnostic testing solutions provider has a market capitalization of $5.70 billion. QuidelOrtho projects 7.9% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 55%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Diagnostic Business Grows Well: We are upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s focus on advancing its diagnostics business to improve human health, which has enabled the company to target market segments that represent significant total market opportunities. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the company remains focused on its three near-term growth drivers — the VITROS System in the Labs business, the Sofia platform within the Point-of-Care business and the Savanna Molecular platform in the Molecular Diagnostics business.Product Innovation Aids Growth: We are optimistic about QuidelOrtho’s progress with its products over the past few months. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the company has 20-25 new and refreshed assays planned for launch by the end of 2024.Over the past few months, QuidelOrtho has been making progress on the regulatory front for its products. On the earnings call, management stated that QuidelOrtho’s Savanna Molecular platform is currently available throughout Europe. The company has plans to commercialize it worldwide upon receiving additional regulatory clearances.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: QuidelOrtho’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust revenues from its Labs segment and China region. The company also registered solid revenues from its Instrument revenue category. QuidelOrtho also saw an uptick in its Vitros System’s integrated installed base and Sofia Platform’s cumulative installed base in the quarter.DownsidesData Security Threats: QuidelOrtho utilizes complex information technology systems to transmit and store information, including proprietary information, to support its business and process. In future, these systems may prove inadequate to its business needs and necessary upgrades may not operate as designed, resulting in high costs or disruptions in portions of the company’s business.Overdependence on Diagnostic Tests: A significant percentage of QuidelOrtho’s revenues comes from the sale of COVID-19 and influenza tests and these are expected to remain a significant portion of the company’s total revenues for at least in the near future. As a result, if sales or revenues of COVID-19 or influenza tests fall for any reason, the company’s operating results will be affected.Estimate TrendQuidelOrtho is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.3% north to $5.26.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $618.2 million, suggesting a 0.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

However, strong competitors in the large medical device market pose a tough challenge for Boston Scientific. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 46% against the industry’s 20.7% decline.Boston Scientific ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, the United States grew 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140-basis point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business unit. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing in double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth was driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.The company remains excited about the rest of the year and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. During the first quarter, the company received health sciences authority approval for FARAPULSE in Singapore. In Japan, first-quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon. China also grew in double digits in the first quarter, ahead of the company’s expectations, on solid procedural demand as hospitals worked through COVID-delayed procedures.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStory continuesThe raised 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wide trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.On the flip side, continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset Boston Scientific’s top-line performance.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal breaks down the streamer's future content plans.Video Transcript- Could some major content changes be coming to Netflix? Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has been talking to experts and tracking the latest developments in the streaming company's strategy. So Allie, what are you hearing so far?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rochelle. And yes. We have been hearing a lot of news out of Netflix over the past few weeks, especially when it comes to its content. And remember that in the background of all of this is Netflix's profitability push. And we've seen the streaming giant really lean into certain revenue initiatives, like the crackdown on password sharing, along with the ad supported tier. So what does this mean for the future of content?And analysts that I've been speaking to have told me that really, Netflix is entering the next phase of this growth. If you remember back in 2017, 2018, Netflix signed on a lot of A-list talent, committing to multimillion-dollar, multi-year deals. And we just heard earlier this week that one of the first producers to sign with Netflix, Ryan Murphy, he's not renewing his contract with the streaming giant. In fact, he reportedly will be heading to Disney. But Murphy signed a massive deal back in 2018. $300 million for five years. That wasn't the only one. Netflix also signed Shonda Rhimes at the time for $100 million. They recently re-upped Shonda Rhimes' contract.So what could this mean when it comes to future deals for Netflix? And analysts have told me that it's likely we might not see these massive deals any longer. Rather, Netflix might be a little bit more strategic about the contracts and the money that they choose to commit to. Now part of that strategy is leaning in to two main areas of growth. One is international content, and one is live sports content.Story continuesSo on the international content side, we just saw Ted Sarandos visit Seoul. He reiterated his $2.5-billion commitment to creating original Korean content. In addition to that, he also said that the company is looking to foster talent behind the camera as well. And analysts said, I've spoken with have said that is the differentiating factor here for Netflix that gives it the competitive edge, its exposure to international markets and the ability for Netflix to really create star-studded content. Content that can really explode in overseas markets. So that's something to look out for moving forward.Another is live sports content. And we've seen a lot of competitors really go after these large contracts with the NBA, NHL, NFL. But Netflix is taking a slightly different approach here. They are leaning into docuseries, like Full Swing, F1. They will reportedly be hosting a live celebrity golf tournament. And that just shows that they are trying to create franchises around sports. They're trying to create these characters that viewers can connect with. That is a cheaper option. And it also allows a lot more experimentation when it comes to the future of live sports since that is really an untapped area for Netflix.So a lot of changes coming. Netflix also has gaming coming out too. So they're leaning into different types of areas of growth right now, and that's something to continue to watch for investors.- And certainly figuring out how they have to pivot given both the ongoing writers strike and the potential for a SAG-AFTRA strike, which means, obviously, not just exposure, the international play. They have to lean into that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right. And you think the longer this strike goes on, there's no end in sight right now, the more that's going to come into play. And because Netflix does have content creators all over the world, does have this access, that certainly is going to set them apart from competitors.- All right. We will have to put a pin in that. Allie Canal, thank you so much for that breakdown as usual.]"

For some more prominent movies in this list, head on over to the 10 Best Movies of all Time.Exceptional films typically excel in various aspects, encompassing compelling writing, captivating music, and memorable performances that often reach iconic status. Ultimately, determining what makes a movie great is subjective, and there isn't a single definitive answer, just as there isn't a singular category for remarkable films. Naturally, movies have evolved significantly from the days of 50-second reels, making ranking the best movies of all time seem even more impossible. With the abundance of films now readily available for streaming from the comfort of home, the options for discovering quality movies are virtually limitless.The film industry or motion picture industry includes commercial and technological companies which specialize in cinematography, film studios, production companies, film production, animation, pre-and post-production, film festivals, and distributors. All of these things together are the filmmaking industry. Today, the movie/cinema industry is not only limited to theaters, but OTT platforms are majorly contributing to the overall revenues of films.Based on a report by The Motion Pictures Association (MPA), the Global Theatrical and Home Entertainment market experienced steady growth from 2016 to 2019. During this period, the market comprised three sectors: Physical, Digital, and Theatrical, with respective values of $8.8 billion, $47.2 billion, and $42.3 billion in the final year of growth. However, the sector faced a significant downturn the following year due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, experiencing an 18% drop to $80.8 billion. This shift caused a major disruption within the industry, as the Theatrical segment plummeted to $12 billion, while the Digital segment surged to $61.8 billion. A different report from Gower Street suggests that the global box office market can grow to $29 billion by the end of this year if it maintains a 12% growth rate, which will still be slower than the 21% growth rate achieved last year. At the same time, Gower Street points out that even if the global box market does grow to $29 billion, it will still be significantly less than the $42.3 billion that it was worth in 2019. Story continuesStreaming, also known as video on demand, has become a prevalent global phenomenon. It was not long ago that the concept of a laptop or smartphone serving as a gateway to vast entertainment platforms, offering an abundance of TV shows and movies at our fingertips, seemed unimaginable. However, we now find ourselves in a reality where the industry not only generates substantial revenue but also demonstrates immense potential for further growth, as demonstrated by the success of streaming services such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, and The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+.While the global streaming market is also made up of other sectors such as healthcare streaming, the video-on-demand subsector is an accurate indicator of pureplay content streaming. On this front, Fortune Business Insights estimates that this market was worth $69.55 billion in 2021 and grew to $82.77 billion in 2022. From then on, it is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 17.6% to be worth $257 billion by the end of 2029.We believe this is actually where most of the value can be realized by movie producers. We believe, eventually, that there will be major consolidation in the streaming industry and with one company serving the entire world with a market capitalization of north of $5 trillion dollars. We believe the winner is likely to be one of Apple Inc. (AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). We don't yet know who the winner will be, but the companies who hold the rights to the 50 best movies of all time that we shared below and other irreplaceable content will be richly rewarded.50 Best Movies of all TimePhoto by JESHOOTS.COM on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo start off our list of the best movies of all time, we first looked at IMDB's expansive list of movies, and then ranked the top 50 according to their respective scores.  The compiled selection consists of contemporary gems such as the acclaimed ""Interstellar"" and ""Parasite,"" which have earned Oscars in recent years, alongside timeless classics like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

94,3d79e547-ecf2-37aa-90d1-549a63c4d4f1,NEE,2023-06-24,Top 20 Countries with Highest Electricity Consumption,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-countries-highest-electricity-190457397.html,1687547097,STORY,['NEE'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 20 countries with highest electricity consumption To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 countries with highest electricity consumption.The discovery of electricity has been perhaps the most pivotal moment in human history, and has been the reason behind the significant advancement in human life in the past few centuries, especially in the past couple of decades. The proper usage of electricity was one of the main drivers behind the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the U.S., which led to them becoming powerhouses and industrial nations, which again, resulted in an elevation in the quality of living. Today, with more and more devices becoming electrical, electricity is a basic necessity for everyone, and one of the main reasons behind why developing nations struggle to improve infrastructure, as countries which are unable to meet electricity needs also struggle in improving the standard of living of its residents, which is why developing nations are rarely counted among the countries with the highest electricity consumption.And while electricity usage is integral in today's world, there is still a lot of controversy on how it's generated. Through the last couple of centuries, electricity generation was primarily through fossil fuels including coal, oil and natural gas, all of which contributes to climate change, which is disastrous for the environment and one of the top risks for 2023, and the foreseeable future as well. While the dangers of fossil fuel burning have been called out by scientists for decades, many major oil and gas companies have lobbied against any changes, with Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest oil companies in the world, having known about climate change around four decades ago, and even allegedly spent millions to promote misinformation.Top 20 countries with highest electricity consumptionHigh-voltage power lines. Electricity distribution station. high voltage electric transmission tower. Distribution electric substation with power lines and transformers.Story continuesHowever, in the last couple of years, the impact of climate change has been felt across the world, with weather patterns being much more unpredictable and severe, leading to catastrophic incidents resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives and tens of billions of dollars in damages. Over the past several years, governments in developed nations in particular have passed legislation to promote the usage of renewable energy resources to become less reliant on fossil fuels, which is great news for the largest renewable companies by market cap. In fact, according to the IAE, nuclear and renewables energy is set to dominate electricity growth demand and over the next three years, and will be expected to meet around 90% of total demand, with the vast majority of it coming from China, which is aiming to transition to renewable electricity and become a powerhouse in that sector.According to the International Energy Agency (IAE), global demand for electricity slowed down very slightly in 2022 even as energy prices rose to record levels as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ensuring Western sanctions on Russia. While the average growth rate for electricity demand has been 2.4% from 2014 to 2019, it fell to 2% in 2022, even as electrification of major infrastructure including in the heating and transport sections continues to grow, and nations which have electrified their infrastructure also rank highly in terms of electricity consumption by country. Another major area of electrical consumption is in the electric vehicles industry, which is growing at an accelerated pace across the world. While Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the most profitable car company in the world, is counted among the pioneers of electric vehicles, many other major companies including Volkswagen, the largest car company by revenue, announcing a major pivot to car vehicles, as the industry attempts to reduce its carbon footprint and become carbon neutral in the coming decades.Globally, electricity demand is mainly driven by India and the U.S., where demand continues to rise. According to the IAE ""Electricity demand in India and the United States rose, while Covid restrictions affected China’s growth. China’s zero-Covid policy weighed heavily on its economic activity in 2022, and a degree of uncertainty remains over the pace of its electricity demand growth. We currently estimate it to be 2.6% in 2022, substantially below its pre-pandemic average of over 5% in the 2015-2019 period. Further data expected in due course will provide greater clarity on trends in China in 2022, which could also have implications for the global picture. Electricity demand in India rose by a strong 8.4% in 2022, due to a combination of its robust post-pandemic economic recovery and exceptionally high summer temperatures. The United States recorded a significant 2.6% y-o-y demand increase in 2022, driven by economic activity and higher residential use to meet both heating and cooling needs amid hotter summer weather and a colder-than-normal winter."" This should provide a major boost to some of the biggest electrical companies in the U.S., including NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), and also should be good news for the countries with the highest electricity consumption.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is also the biggest solar company in the world right now, in addition to generating electricity from other renewable energy resources and in 2023, its CFO Kirk Crews, stated in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. We believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy. In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan, now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar. Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector, reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions. This quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business.""There is strong mix between the countries that consume the most electricity and countries that generate the most electricity, though several countries export excess electricity. Of course, the biggest electricity consumers are developed nations where electricity is available throughout the country, while in developing countries there is still a major gap between demand and supply especially in rural areas but often in urban areas as well. Also, electric vehicles, which account for a significant portion of electricity consumption, are more readily available in developed nations. For our rankings, we have ranked countries by their electricity consumption in TWh in 2020 and 2021, with 70% weightage assigned to the latter, with data being sourced from Enerdata.20. SpainConsumption in 2020: 227 TWhConsumption in 2021: 233 TWhSpain sees some of the highest temperatures in Europe, because of which there is higher electricity demand in the country. The country recently agreed to introduce a new electricity tariff which will be aimed at preventing price spikes.19. AustraliaConsumption in 2020: 239 TWhConsumption in 2021: 238 TWhEl Niño, a phenomenon where temperatures soar to record levels, is likely to occur in this year, which may result in disruption of electricity supply for Australians as high temperatures drive greater demand.18. TaiwanConsumption in 2020: 256 TWhConsumption in 2021: 260 TWhTaiwan's electricity consumption per capita is three times higher as compared to Asia's average, but it has had to increase its electricity rate recently which will have a negative impact on its industries.17. IndonesiaConsumption in 2020: 257 TWhConsumption in 2021: 270 TWhIndonesia's electricity consumption has increased over 6% in 2022, over an already healthy increase in 2021. A large portion of this growth is due to the resumption of economic activities after the Covid-19 pandemic, giving it a place among the countries with the highest electricity consumption.16. TurkeyConsumption in 2020: 263 TWhConsumption in 2021: 284 TWhTurkey's fast growth both in terms of population and economy has seen energy demand skyrocket, with its electricity consumption increasing by more than 450% as compared to 1990.15. MexicoConsumption in 2020: 282 TWhConsumption in 2021: 291 TWhMexico pledged to source 35% of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2024 though it is unlikely to meet its target. However, the country has made progress in the wind and solar energy area with its President seeking major foreign investment for huge renewable energy projects.14. IranConsumption in 2020: 277 TWhConsumption in 2021: 299 TWhWhile Iran has suffered heavily in the past couple of decades as a result of Western sanctions, it is a major electricity exporter, sealing a deal recently with Pakistan to power Gwadar, while Iraq also recently agreed to pay $2.76 billion to Iran to pay off its electricity and gas debt.13. United KingdomConsumption in 2020: 289 TWhConsumption in 2021: 293 TWhWhile the UK's electricity consumption is quite high already, it is set to increase further as the Scottish and Southern Energy Network has agreed to invest $12.5 billion in its networks in Scotland to increase production.12. ItalyConsumption in 2020: 284 TWhConsumption in 2021: 300 TWhAccording to a study conducted by climate change thinktank ECCO, Italy needs to add around 190 GW of renewable energy capacity latest by 2035 if it is to meet its G7 obligation to reach nearly net-zero power system by the next decade.11. Saudi ArabiaConsumption in 2020: 308 TWhConsumption in 2021: 321 TWhOne of the richest nations in the world thanks to its massive oil reserves, Saudi Arabia is unsurprisingly almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels for electricity production, with nearly 90% of its production coming form fossil fuels.10. FranceConsumption in 2020: 420 TWhConsumption in 2021: 441 TWhWhile its already among the highest electricity consuming countries in the world, France's electricity consumption is set to increase further at a sharp rate by 2030, based on an RTE survey. The vast majority of electricity production in the country comes from nuclear power, which is a controversial topic in and of itself.9. GermanyConsumption in 2020: 490 TWhConsumption in 2021: 503 TWhThe highest electricity consuming country in the European Union, Germany is also a major industrial nation which is why its electricity consumption is so high. According to Reuters, the country also recently overtook China to become the second most attractive investment opportunity for renewables.8. South KoreaConsumption in 2020: 527 TWhConsumption in 2021: 533 TWhEven though South Korea has achieved many enviable metrics, two-thirds of its electricity generation is still coming from fossil fuels, though non-hydro renewable resources are its fastest growing power generation source. However, much more needs to be done to increase the percentage of renewable energy production in the country.7. CanadaConsumption in 2020: 561 TWhConsumption in 2021: 562 TWhCanada's electricity consumption may have been almost the same between 2020 and 2021, but it's still among the highest electricity consuming countries in the world. Due to the record number of wildfires recently in the country, the resulting smoke has reduced solar power production falling by 50% in the U.S. Northeast.6. BrazilConsumption in 2020: 533 TWhConsumption in 2021: 579 TWhThe highest electricity consumer in Latin America, Brazil's clean electricity reached a decade high as its fossil rate consumption continues to fall. Higher energy production from wind and solar energy resources is the main driver behind this significant improvement.Click to continue reading and see top 5 countries with highest electricity consumption.Suggested Articles:15 Affordable Beachfront Retirement Communities16 Least Profitable Industries in the USTitanium Reserves By Country: 10 Biggest Mines In The WorldDisclosure: None.

San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly said in an interview to Reuters that two more rate hikes this year is a ""very reasonable"" projection, but hinted for the need for a more careful approach.Her comments followed a hawkish stance by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his two-day testimony before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week.Markets calmed briefly and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq added some gains in the previous session after Powell said the Fed will proceed with caution.But the indexes were still set to snap multiple weeks of gains, their worst weekly performance since the bank rout in March.The S&amp;P 500 is on track to end a five-week winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite is on pace to end an eight-week run of gains. The Dow Jones may close lower for a third-straight week.""You're seeing a little bit of profit taking after a big run,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.""We're clearly overbought and without proof being demonstrated by the Bulls, it is going to be a tough slog from here to make higher highs, especially with the weakness that we're seeing overseas this week.""Money markets are still pricing in one more rate hike of 25 basis points (bps) in July, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, as opposed to two more as suggested by Powell.Yields on the 2-year, which best reflects interest rate expectations, dropped to hover at 4.77% on Friday, in line with the European bond market following weaker-than-expected euro zone data.Story continuesOn the data front, S&amp;P Global's Purchasing Managers' Index for both U.S. manufacturing and services activity showed business activity fell to a three-month low in June as services growth eased for the first time this year and the contraction in the manufacturing sector deepened.All 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading lower, with technology stocks leading declines.Market heavyweights, including Tesla, Nvidia and Microsoft, were down between 0.8% and 1.7%, pressuring the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Meanwhile, Meta Platforms will return to its former status as a full-growth stock after financial data provider FTSE Russell finishes its annual shakeup of its stock index components later in the day.At 12:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 172.59 points, or 0.51%, at 33,774.12, the S&amp;P 500 was down 26.28 points, or 0.60%, at 4,355.61, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 117.01 points, or 0.86%, at 13,513.60.Carmax Inc jumped 8.6% after the used-car retailer's first-quarter profit exceeded market expectations, benefiting from cost cuts.Starbucks Corp fell 2.3% as the coffee chain's unions said around 3,500 workers will strike next week in the U.S. after it claimed the company banned Pride month decorations at its cafes.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.27-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.30-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 98 new lows.

To skip our detailed analysis of the Metaverse and its advancements, go directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Invest In.While the idea of a real-life ""Matrix"" may appear to belong solely to the realm of science fiction, it is important to remember that notions such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and even the internet itself were once deemed fantastical concepts too. The metaverse, a digital sphere still in its early evolution, is an immersive three-dimensional universe that has become a hot topic in the world of technology. Individuals within the metaverse engage in virtual environments and forge connections with others in the digital realm. Following Facebook's name change to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), there was a staggering surge of 7,200% in internet searches for the term 'metaverse'. Once individuals grasp the concept, a significant majority wholeheartedly embrace it: according to recent research conducted by McKinsey, around 60% of consumers express excitement about the metaverse's potential to transform everyday activities such as shopping, dating, and exercising.According to a report by Precedence Research, the global metaverse market accounted for $68.49 billion in 2022 and it is estimated to surpass around $1.3 trillion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 44.5% during the forecast period 2022 to 2030. While the potential impact of the metaverse varies across industries, it holds implications for all of them. McKinsey, for example, estimates that it may have a market impact of between $2 trillion and $2.6 trillion on e-commerce by 2030. Similarly, an impact of $180 billion to $270 billion on the academic virtual learning market is expected, while a $108 billion to $125 billion impact is anticipated on the gaming market.Overall, this industry is poised to grow with more companies planning to get involved. The technologies that are involved with the metaverse can include virtual reality (VR), characterized by persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you are not playing, as well as augmented reality (AR) that combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the many that are making strides in the space and could be at the forefront of the metaverse's massive opportunity.

Shares traded as high as $340 in 2021 but today are down around $200. With this declining share price, Autodesk management has been able to take the healthy free cash flow it generates and retire some of its shares outstanding at an accelerated rate.At the beginning of 2022, Autodesk had approximately 220 million shares outstanding. Today, that number is down to around 216 million, and we expect this number to continue to drop over the next few years as the company ramps up its free cash flow generation. This reduction in share count will juice growth in free cash flow per share, which will determine what returns we get owning Autodesk over the long haul. The lower the stock drops, the faster Autodesk’s share count drops, all else equal.”7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California, and incorporated in Delaware.

Qualcomm fundamentals have been hurt over the last several quarters due to excess smartphone inventories. Management messaged in their recent conference call that inventory issues peaked in their first fiscal quarter and should begin to moderate. They are also seeing excess inventory in their IoT (Internet of Things) business, which will take a couple of quarters to work through. By our estimates, Qualcomm fundamentals should trough in the June quarter with a second-half recovery. Qualcomm remains well positioned to diversify away from smartphones with long-term growth in Auto and IoT.”6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), originally called Adobe Systems Incorporated, is an American multinational computer software company known for its multimedia and creativity software products, including Photoshop, Acrobat Reader, and Creative Cloud.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a prominent metaverse stock.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Invest In.Suggested articles:12 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy NowTop 15 Shipbuilding Countries in the World12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 12 Best Metaverse Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the Future. Dividend Aristocrats are a group of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. These companies are typically well-established and have histories of stable earnings and cash flows. They have demonstrated their ability to generate profits even during economic downturns. This was validated during the high inflationary environment of last year when the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Moreover, these dividend growers surpassed other asset classes in 25 of the last 32 years. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with decades-long dividend growth streaks.In recent years, dividend investment has gained even more prominence as a popular strategy, primarily due to the market experiencing heightened periods of volatility. The S&amp;P 500 yearly dividend payouts have seen an upward trend over the years, jumping from $420 billion in 2017 to $522 billion in 2021, as we reported in our article 10 Dividend Stocks with 10%+ Yield. In 2022, the dividend payments reached their all-time high of $561 billion. This shows that by investing in dividend stocks, investors can benefit from potential long-term growth and income generation. Moreover, dividends represented a significant portion of the market’s total return in the past. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for approximately 17% of the total return generated by the S&amp;P 500 Index, according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Also read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According to AnalystsWhen we speak about the long-term growth potential of dividend stocks, reinvesting dividends is one way to allow for compounding returns over time. From 1978 through 2020, dividends and reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the market’s overall returns. This means that if someone had invested $10,000 and consistently reinvested the dividends earned, their initial investment would have grown to an impressive amount exceeding $1.2 million during this period.Story continuesThough growth tech stocks are stealing the limelight this year so far, dividend stocks still have the capacity to outshine as companies continue to increase their payouts. Analysts also support the projected strong performance of dividend growers this year. Ford Donohue, a financial advisor at Homrich Berg, emphasized the importance of dividend growth stocks in his May interview with Fortune:“A diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. “We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of a stock.”Similarly, Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin also spoke with Business Insider about dividend stocks' outlook this year and mentioned that the S&amp;P 500’s dividend-per-share (DPS) is anticipated to grow by 4% by 2024. He further mentioned that recent actions taken by companies suggest a favorable environment for dividend growth.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the FuturePhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies from the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 14 years or more and are on the steady path to becoming dividend aristocrats.

KTOS announced that it opened a new India-based Space Domain Awareness (“SDA”) facility, which has increased Kratos’ global satellite tracking coverage by more than 30%.The primary objective of the SDA network is to monitor the behavior of space-based radio frequency (“RF”) signals to identify critical information about satellites in orbit, such as their position, maneuvering, health, proximity to other satellites and more. Kratos’ SDA network includes over twenty worldwide sites hosting more than 140 fixed and steerable RF sensors and antennas. The network is capable of tracking and detecting space vehicles and provides real-time data to its customers.With more than 500 satellites operating in the geosynchronous orbit (“GEO”), the role of Kratos’ network becomes very critical and governments as well as commercial organizations rely on Kratos to safeguard their million-dollar equipment in space.Need to Track Space ObjectsThe GEO belt is getting congested with numerous satellites sent by different nations. Per Fortune Business Insights, the global space situational awareness (“SSA”) market is projected to grow from $1.27 billion in 2021 to $1.73 billion in 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 5.27% in the forecast period. Per the report, the U.S. Space Command has been tracking and monitoring more than 28,000 space objects, of which only 3,373 are active satellites.

111,cd37f5a1-9a31-3539-9b68-245dbaf2d8c1,PHM,2023-06-24,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in PulteGroup Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-pultegroup-123006213.html,1687523406,STORY,['PHM'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in PulteGroup (PHM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PHM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?PulteGroup's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at PulteGroup's main business drivers.Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding (which accounted for 98.1% as of 2022 total revenues) and Financial Services (1.9%).The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices, with a variety of options and amenities to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. Pulte’s brand portfolio includes Centex, Pulte Homes,Del Webb, DiVosta Homes, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.The company operates in 810 active communities in 42 markets in 24 states across the United States in 2022. The homebuilding division is broken down into six reportable segments; Northeast, Southeast, Florida, Texas, Midwest and West.Pulte’s direct subsidiaries under the homebuilding segment include Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., Del Webb Corporation and Centex Corporation.Pulte’s Financial Services business includes mortgage banking and title operations through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Pulte Mortgage arranges financing by originating mortgage loans for homebuyers.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s orders were 8,898 units, up from 8,767 homes in the prior- year quarter. Quarter-end backlog totaled 13,129 homes versus 19,935 units in the year ago quarter. Potential housing revenues from quarter-end backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year to $8 billion.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in PulteGroup ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $4,043.06, or a 304.31% gain, as of June 23, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 175.17% and the price of gold increased 36.08% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for PHM.Shares of PulteGroup have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. The company has been benefiting from robust land acquisition and operational strategic initiatives. PHM expects the land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. This is attributed to strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $2.43 per share from $2.41 in the past 30 days, reflecting analysts optimism over the company's prospect. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.The stock is up 14.33% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 6 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the Future. Dividend Aristocrats are a group of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. These companies are typically well-established and have histories of stable earnings and cash flows. They have demonstrated their ability to generate profits even during economic downturns. This was validated during the high inflationary environment of last year when the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Moreover, these dividend growers surpassed other asset classes in 25 of the last 32 years. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with decades-long dividend growth streaks.In recent years, dividend investment has gained even more prominence as a popular strategy, primarily due to the market experiencing heightened periods of volatility. The S&amp;P 500 yearly dividend payouts have seen an upward trend over the years, jumping from $420 billion in 2017 to $522 billion in 2021, as we reported in our article 10 Dividend Stocks with 10%+ Yield. In 2022, the dividend payments reached their all-time high of $561 billion. This shows that by investing in dividend stocks, investors can benefit from potential long-term growth and income generation. Moreover, dividends represented a significant portion of the market’s total return in the past. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for approximately 17% of the total return generated by the S&amp;P 500 Index, according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Also read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According to AnalystsWhen we speak about the long-term growth potential of dividend stocks, reinvesting dividends is one way to allow for compounding returns over time. From 1978 through 2020, dividends and reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the market’s overall returns. This means that if someone had invested $10,000 and consistently reinvested the dividends earned, their initial investment would have grown to an impressive amount exceeding $1.2 million during this period.Story continuesThough growth tech stocks are stealing the limelight this year so far, dividend stocks still have the capacity to outshine as companies continue to increase their payouts. Analysts also support the projected strong performance of dividend growers this year. Ford Donohue, a financial advisor at Homrich Berg, emphasized the importance of dividend growth stocks in his May interview with Fortune:“A diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. “We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of a stock.”Similarly, Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin also spoke with Business Insider about dividend stocks' outlook this year and mentioned that the S&amp;P 500’s dividend-per-share (DPS) is anticipated to grow by 4% by 2024. He further mentioned that recent actions taken by companies suggest a favorable environment for dividend growth.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the FuturePhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies from the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 14 years or more and are on the steady path to becoming dividend aristocrats.

115,fc08b66a-9117-3f49-ae60-3ee67f7ba63d,MDT,2023-06-24,Medtronic presents new data on MiniMed™ 780G system on fixed meal dosing and real-world Time in Range across wide variety of users,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-presents-data-minimed-780g-013000821.html,1687570200,STORY,['MDT'],"[DUBLIN and SAN DIEGO, June 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, is presenting a robust collection of new clinical and real-world data on the MiniMed™ 780G system. These latest data sets, which evaluated the system across a wide range of users, including historically challenging younger patients, those not meeting glycemic goals, and individuals using a simplified meal announcement leveraging fixed carbohydrate amounts instead of exact carb calculations, found that the proprietary Meal Detection™ technology supported Time in Range outcomes that exceed consensus guidelines of 70 percent. Additionally, the system is helping reduce the percent of time spent in hyperglycemia in children and adults. These latest results were presented this weekend at the 83rd American Diabetes Association (ADA) Scientific Sessions in San Diego, CA.Simplified Meal Announcements with the MiniMed™ 780G SystemThe first study by Dr. Goran Petrovski, MD, PhD, of Sidra Medicine, randomly assigned adolescents using the MiniMed™ 780G system (n=34) into two groups, with some entering a fixed pre-set number of carbs (small, average, or high) and some calculating a precise number of carbs for their meals. These individuals had lived with diabetes for at least one year and used multiple daily injections or pump therapy prior to the study. Results from the study, which were presented Friday in an oral podium presentation, showed those using the simplified (i.e., fixed) carb entry maintained international targets for glycemic control, including an A1c of 6.9% and Time in Range (TIR) of 72.7% (vs. 79.4% TIR in the precise entry group) over 6 months without system modification.1 Additionally, the simplified entry group lowered their time above 250 mg/dL from 28.3% to 5.3% at six months (vs. 3.9% in the precise entry group). After 3 months, 88% chose to continue with the simplified meal management approach, which suggests user satisfaction with this less burdensome approach. These results suggest that reduced accuracy in carb counting can be overcome by the increased automated insulin delivery provided by the MiniMed™ 780G system, and that even those that cannot or do not input their carbs precisely can reach glycemic goals and reduce hyperglycemia.Story continues""Many individuals with type 1 diabetes struggle with meal management with nearly 50% considering carb counting the most burdensome aspect of diabetes management.2 Indeed, many frequently underestimate their carbs or forget to bolus and this has an adverse impact on clinical outcomes,"" said Dr. Petrovski. ""This study shows that a simplified meal management approach with the MiniMed™ 780G system helped users maintain glycemic targets while providing forgiveness for inexact carb counts. Clearly there's more runway for simplification of diabetes management with this system and it's promising for the many patients struggling with meal management.""Strong Real-World Performance in ChildrenAn analysis of real-world evidence of children ≤ 15 years in Europe and Latin America (n=3,543) using the MiniMed™ 780G system with recommended settings of 100 mg/dL and 2-hour active insulin time (AIT) demonstrated a Time in Range of 78% (Table 1).3 A separate analysis of real-world evidence of children ≤ 15 years in Europe (n= 2,516) demonstrated improved glycemic performance in SmartGuard™ technology regardless of baseline glycemic control.4 The group with the lowest Time in Range (poorest glycemic control) prior to SmartGuard™ technology, had the largest increase of 23.3% in Time in Range, while patients with the best metabolic control in SmartGuard™ technology achieved 80.6% Time in Range (Table 2). Additionally, this increase in Time in Range was seen with less effort as evidenced by fewer user-initiated boluses, indicating decreased patient burden.Table 1: Real-World Evidence of Pediatric Users in Europe, Middle East and Africa &amp; Latin America (using Recommended Settings)Europe, Middle East and AfricaLatin AmericaAll Users ≤ 15 yearsWith RecommendedSettingsAll Users ≤ 15yearsWith RecommendedSettingsTime in SmartGuard™ technology92.7 %94.6 %93.5 %94.9 %Time in Range73.9 %78.9 %74.2 %78.2 %Time Above Range (&gt; 180 mg/dL)22.9 %17.5 %23.0 %18.9 %  Table 2: Real-World Evidence of Pediatric Users in Europe (using Recommended Settings)Group 1 (Lowest glycemiccontrol atinitiation) Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 (Highest glycemic control at initiation) Baseline With MM780G Baseline With MM780G Baseline With MM780G Baseline With MM780G Time in SmartGuard™technology -89.9 %-91.5 %-93.2 %-91.9 %Time in Range 41.0 %64.3 %55.5 %69.9 %65.7 %73.1 %79.8 %80.6 %Time Above Range57.2 %33.3 %42 %27 %30.9 %23.8 %16.6 %16.5 %User-initiated boluses/day 6.34.9*6.65.7*7.05.9*6.76.3*Insulin Units Delivered by Auto Correction 14.418.012.314.512.013.310.210.9*Baseline vs post-AHCL number of daily boluses comparison (p&lt;0.0001).Medtronic Extended Infusion Set Real-World Data For the first time, real-world data on the Medtronic Extended Infusion™ Set was presented (n=108) and the analysis showed an average infusion set wear time of 6.74 days.

116,5c3e77f1-c111-333c-9307-d7c9e187bf64,CCI,2023-06-24,20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-infrastructure-companies-us-202056005.html,1687551656,STORY,"['AMT', 'FLR', 'PAA', 'SRE', 'PARR', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'KMI', 'CCI']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S.For a country to develop and improve its standard of living, improved infrastructure is not just essential but integral to said development. Reliable infrastructure allows for supply chains to link up and efficiently move goods and services across various locations. Households are connected to major metropolitan areas where greater job opportunities are present and thus, allow for an increasing pool of talent, decreasing unemployment. Similarly, broadband services allow for greater remote connections than ever before, and in a world where remote working is becoming more and more common, can also directly result in higher employment and better standards of living even in remote areas. This is why many developing economies attempt to spend heavily on infrastructure and companies, while the poorest countries in the world are known for their lack of proper infrastructure.20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the USIn the U.S., the debate on railroads, which are a crucial part of the country's economic stability, raged in late 2022 when railroad workers threatened a strike, and the shutdown would have cost billions of dollars in damage at the very minimum to the nation's economy, which was already battling an impending recession because of high inflation and hiking of interest rates. Even though the top railroads in the country, some of which are also among the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., earned soaring profits in 2022, none of this was transmitted to the labor, the backbone of the industry. The railroad workers demanded better pay, improved working conditions and paid time off. Generally, the government can't do much to stop protests and strikes under expression of free speech, but the railroad industry works a little differently. Because of an almost century old arcane law that governs only airlines and railroads, what should have been an economic issue became a political one, and allowed the government to intervene.Story continuesBecause of The Railway Labor Act, the House committee was able to impose the same contract terms on railroad workers that they had firmly rejected, and this was swiftly followed by confirmation in the Senate. After that, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the measure in December 2022, and thus, the possibility of a strike was averted even though railroad workers were not happy with the package they were getting. The strike would have resulted in almost 30% of the country's freight shipments coming to a halt, and would likely have directly increased inflation. While the end result was excellent for some of the largest infrastructure companies in the U.S. and shareholders, the news was not good for those forced to work for these companies in such conditions.According to UBS, infrastructure industry performance in 2022 remained stable even as global economic turmoil continued to rise. The main aim of the infrastructure industry, and the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., is to continue increased focus on digitization and decarbonization, two of the most important cornerstones in terms of assessing a company's outlook and growth potential as financials alone are no longer sufficient to determine whether a company is a good option for investment. While most infrastructure companies have maintained stability, those engaged in the oil and gas sector have deliver robust growth as energy prices sky-rocketed as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, this growth does not seem to very sustainable as oil prices have already dropped significantly from their peak and commodities are expected to be moderate in both 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, private infrastructure companies are in the spotlight currently as they have demonstrated resilience even in a turbulent market and have been considered great opportunities for investment right now.Summarizing their results in 2022 and outlook for 2022, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), one of the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings transcript ""However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to slide eight. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment.""The biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. have combined revenues in excess of $520 billion annually, while their market cap exceeds $862 billion. To finalize our list, we consulted companies from Engineering News Record Top 100 list and from Fortune 500. For companies which were listed, their trailing twelve month revenue (TTM) and latest market cap was taken from Yahoo Finance and were ranked based on their average ranking for the two criteria.

The agency has been concerned whether Twitter had the staffing to abide by a May 2022 settlement with the FTC in which it agreed to improve its privacy practices.In April, the committee subpoenaed Khan for documents related to the Twitter privacy probe following Musk's $44 billion purchase of the social media company in October.House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan suggested in a June 8 letter ""there is an unjustified approximate one-year gap in the FTC’s actions with respect to Twitter"" and added it was reasonable to conclude neither the prior chair nor Khan ""seriously planned to take action against Twitter ""until political pressure arose given Mr. Musk’s impending acquisition.""Jordan in February also questioned the FTC's plans to adopt a new rule to ban noncompete clauses for workers and its approach to the merger of Illumina and Grail.San Diego-based Illumina, which specializes in gene sequencing, is appealing an FTC order that said the company's $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail will curb competition in the cancer-testing market.

Nike raised its outlook for fiscal year 2023 after better-than-expected results in the third quarter, and now expects reported revenue to grow in the high single-digits, up from the prior guidance of mid-single-digits. In Q4, revenues are expected to grow in the flat to low single-digits.More from Footwear NewsPolice Reportedly Uncover Up to $7 Million Worth of Stolen Nike Products Top 5 NBA Draft Picks of All Time: From LeBron James to the Ball BrothersAs for fiscal year 2024, Nike’s guidance will likely depend on its ability resolve some current outstanding issues weighing its business. According to UBS analyst Jay Sole, a weakening macro backdrop in North America and a less-than-robust sales rebound in China will likely lead Nike to announce a weaker-than-expected outlook for fiscal year 2024.“If North America has slowed down more than we realize, it would likely also negatively impact gross margin,” Sole wrote in a recent note to investors. As for inventory, Sole says it is likely Nike’s inventory position will “improve sequentially.”“We still think Nike’s inventory position will get better, but excess footwear [stock] in the U.S. is probably a reason Nike’s inventory growth rate won’t look great,” Sole wrote.In December, Nike CEO and president John Donahoe said he believed the company had overcome the peak of its inventory excesses after using markdowns, promotions and the wholesale channel to liquidate inventory. But inventories still grew 16% year-over-year in Q3.Across sporting goods, inventory levels are not expected to normalize until late 2023 or earlier 2024, wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton in a note to investors this week.Story continues“Nike is not excluded from this industry dynamic, which leads us to suspect Nike may report elevated inventory levels exiting fiscal 2023,” Straton wrote. “This would stand in contrast to Nike’s hopes of entering 2024 clean.”Still, if the Swoosh comes out with a detailed plan, it could save the market from reacting poorly, Straton added.A generally sluggish wholesale environment could also have an impact. In recent weeks, retailers such as Macy’s and DSW have announced renewed wholesale partnerships with Nike. At the same time, many of these retailers have reported sales declines across their businesses as consumers pull back their spending on discretionary items.According to Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic, Nike won’t suffer the consequences of the wholesale slowdown, as many of its partners have had mainly upbeat sentiments about the brand recently.“Commentary from wholesale partners, while mixed overall in tone, has not been nearly as draconian as investor sentiment would seem, particularly on the higher end of the distribution spectrum,” Nikic noted. “In fact, most of Nike’s large North American wholesale partners had positive commentary about Nike sell-throughs.”If the wholesale slowdown does happen to weigh on Nike this quarter, other wins could balance out these losses, said Baird analyst Jonathan Komp in a note this week.“The broader gross margin and China recovery opportunity provide good earnings visibility,” Komp wrote. “In our view, Nike remains attractive given positive brand momentum and competitive positioning, high operating margin (low earnings sensitivity) and more reasonable valuation.”Nike is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter and full year on June 29.Best of Footwear NewsList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should KnowWith Minimum Wage on the Rise, These Are Some of the Highest Paid Retail JobsWhat Is Nike's Return Policy?

While the broader crypto market is down and experiencing numerous challenges, the sentiment around Web3 and a decentralized, creator-focused digital future remains positive.Entertainment as a “stealthy” tool: Visual media like TV and movies have the potential to onboard mass consumers in a gradual and fluid way, according to executives in the entertainment industry. “Mainstream adoption will probably look less like a conscious choice and will just happen to be powered by this technology,” Chris Jacquemin, says head of digital strategy at global talent agency WME.NFT memberships and supercharging fandom: Thanks to NFTs, artists are able control how their tickets are distributed and reward their fans for engagement, experts in the ticketing and loyalty field say. “Any artist who is minting their own NFTs can explore token-gated sales, which can be used to help match token holders with premier seats, pre-show experiences or to simply give first access to all tickets on an upcoming tour,” said David Marcus, EVP of music at Ticketmaster.Gaming that provides “true ownership” of assets: Gamers around the world are spending billions of dollars each year on in-game assets – without actually owning those assets, according to gaming industry leaders. NFTs allow players to buy, sell and trade those assets, giving them value inside and outside of the game. “It's about just getting something back for what you put into it, in terms of possessing some sort of interoperable utility,” said Spencer Tucker, chief gaming officer at Yuga Labs.Story continuesFancy footwork: Major sneaker companies have continued to team up with both Web2 and Web3 brands to bring digital collectibles to their millions of fans.

(OpenSea)MfersWho: Pseudonymous NFT collector and artist SartoshiWhat: Mfers, an NFT collection of hand drawings released in 2021, received a boost in both sales and volume this week, according to OpenSea. It’s not entirely clear why the collection was trending, though a recent product release by home improvement giant Lowe’s that featured two characters from the open-source collection gained some buzz. The collection offers no utility and no roadmap and was inspired by the “Are ya winning, son?” meme.How: The project operates under a CC0 license, which means that the project is in the public domain and can be used in any way by anyone. In June 2022, Sartoshi transferred the project’s smart contract and ownership to the community. The simplistic collection has gained a major following online, and individual NFTs often sell for over $1,000 – far higher than their original mint price of 0.069 ETH, or about $320. So far, the collection has done 66,510 ETH in sales, or nearly $125 million.

Nike (NKE), which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this athletic apparel maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 41.35%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Nike came out with earnings of $0.79 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.52 per share, representing a surprise of 51.92%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.85 per share, delivering a surprise of 30.77%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Nike. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Nike currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.60%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on June 29, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

NKE is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jun 29. The leading sports apparel retailer is likely to have witnessed top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, while its earnings per share are expected to have declined year over year.The company has been gaining from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with strong demand, compelling products, and robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses. Supply-chain constraints, continued weakness in Greater China and higher costs have been weighing on its performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $12.6 billion, suggesting 2.8% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 67 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 25.6% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter have moved up by a penny in the past seven days.For fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $51 billion, suggesting 9.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $3.24 per share, suggesting a decline of 13.6% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have been unchanged in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 51.9%. Its bottom line beat the consensus estimate by 24%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNIKE is expected to have witnessed continued gains from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, and robust digital and DTC performance are expected to have been other tailwinds.Continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct has been boosting conversion rates. The strong member buying trends are likely to have led to record digital performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength in North America, EMEA and APLA regions, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value, are likely to have aided sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, as well as commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value. The NIKE Direct business is likely to have benefited from growth in North America, EMEA and APLA, offset by continued weakness in Greater China in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect total NIKE Brand revenues to increase 1.8% year over year to $11,866.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. The increase is likely to be driven by a 1.2% growth in Direct-to-Consumer and a 2.7% rise in the Wholesale business.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted flat to low-single-digit revenue growth for the fiscal fourth quarter. For fiscal 2023, it expects revenues to grow in high-single digits.However, NKE has been witnessing a decline in gross and operating margins due to rising costs, higher markdowns, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. Also, elevated SG&amp;A expenses are concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management provided a bleak view for fiscal 2023, driven by expectations of ongoing and accelerated actions to reduce inventory by year-end, higher freight and logistics expenses, and 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For fiscal 2023, management predicted gross margin to contract 250 basis points, at the low end of its earlier mentioned range.NIKE has been reporting elevated SG&amp;A expenses, driven by increased demand creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal fourth quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected fiscal 2023 SG&amp;A expenses to increase 10% year over year.We anticipate gross margin to decline 150 bps to 43.5%. Meanwhile, our estimate for SG&amp;A expense of $4,321.1 million indicates a rise of 7.1% year over year. Driven by the soft gross margin and higher SG&amp;A expense, our model suggests a 320-bps contraction in operating margin to 8.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

Other treatments for alopecia areata - which include oral steroids and topical medications - target only certain affected parts of the body.AA affects 300,000 people in the U.S. each year. It gained increased attention after actor and talk show host Jada Pinkett Smith, who suffers from the condition, was at the center of a controversy at the Academy Awards in 2022.Pfizer could price its product competitively with Olumiant, BMO Capital analyst Keith Tapper said before the approval.Olumiant has alist priceof $2,622 for a 30-day supply of 2-microgram tablets or $5,244 for a 30-day supply of 4-microgram tablets, according to Lilly's website.Pfizer's application to the FDA was based on data from a mid- to late-stage study that showed 80% or more hair coverage after six months of using the drug compared to a placebo.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LITFULO™ (ritlecitinib), a once-daily oral treatment, for individuals 12 years of age and older with severe alopecia areata. The approved recommended dose for LITFULO is 50 mg. It is the first and only treatment approved by the FDA for adolescents (12+) with severe alopecia areata.""While patients may start to develop symptoms of alopecia areata at any age, most people start showing signs in their teens, twenties, or thirties,"" said Dr. Brittany Craiglow, Associate Professor Adjunct – Dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. ""LITFULO is a particularly important treatment option for younger patients with substantial hair loss, who often struggle with such a visible disease.""LITFULO is a kinase inhibitor which inhibits Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family of kinases.""LITFULO is an important treatment advancement for alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that previously had no FDA-approved options for adolescents and limited options available for adults,"" said Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer, President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer. ""With today’s approval, adolescents and adults who struggle with substantial hair loss have an opportunity to achieve significant scalp hair regrowth.""The FDA approval was based on results of clinical trials in alopecia areata. The ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial, which enrolled 718 patients with 50% or more scalp hair loss as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), evaluated the efficacy and safety of LITFULO at 118 sites in 18 countries. In this pivotal study, 23% of patients treated with LITFULO 50 mg had 80% or more scalp hair coverage (SALT≤20) after six months compared to 1.6% with placebo. The efficacy and safety of LITFULO were consistent between adolescents (12 through 17 years of age) and adults (18 years of age and older). The most common adverse events (AEs) reported in at least 4% of patients with LITFULO include headache (10.8%), diarrhea (10%), acne (6.2%), rash (5.4%), and urticaria (4.6%). Full results from the ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 study were published by The Lancet in April 2023.Story continues""People living with alopecia areata are often misunderstood, and their experience is frequently trivialized as ‘just hair.’ However, it is a serious autoimmune disease that can have considerable negative impact beyond the physical symptoms,"" said Nicole Friedland, President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF). ""We believe the approval of LITFULO is a significant advancement for the treatment of alopecia areata, particularly for teens. It’s exciting to see more FDA-approved treatments becoming available for this community.""View the full Prescribing Information. If it is not currently available via this link, it will be visible as soon as possible as we work to finalize the document. Please check back for the full information shortly.LITFULO will be available in the coming weeks.About Alopecia AreataAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease characterized by patchy or complete hair loss on the scalp, face, or body.1,2 It has an underlying immuno-inflammatory pathogenesis and develops when the immune system attacks the body’s hair follicles, causing hair to fall out.1,2,3 This hair loss often occurs on the scalp, but it can also affect eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, and other areas of the body.1,2 Alopecia totalis (total scalp hair loss) and alopecia universalis (total body hair loss) are types of alopecia areata.1Impacting nearly 7 million people in the U.S. and approximately 147 million people globally, alopecia areata can affect people of any age, gender, race, or ethnicity and can cause considerable burden beyond hair loss.1,2,3,4 Nearly 20% of people with alopecia areata are diagnosed before the age of 18.5Additional Details on the ALLEGRO Clinical Trial ProgramThe randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial (NCT03732807) investigated LITFULO in patients 12 years of age and older with alopecia areata. Patients included in the study had 50% or more scalp hair loss as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT), including patients with alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis, who were experiencing a current episode of alopecia areata that had lasted between six months and 10 years.Patients were randomized to receive once-daily LITFULO (50 mg, 30 mg, 10 mg) with or without one month of initial treatment with once-daily LITFULO 200 mg, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks. At Week 24, LITFULO groups continued their assigned doses and patients initially assigned to placebo switched to LITFULO (50 mg or 200 mg loading dose + 50 mg) for an additional 24 weeks.In this pivotal study, a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with LITFULO 50 mg had 80% or more scalp hair coverage (SALT≤20) after six months of treatment versus placebo (23% treated with LITFULO 50 mg compared to 1.6% with placebo).The most common AEs occurring in at least 1% of patients through 24 weeks were headache, diarrhea, acne, rash, urticaria, folliculitis, pyrexia, atopic dermatitis, dizziness, blood creatinine phosphokinase increase, herpes zoster, red blood cell count decrease, and stomatitis. Cases of serious infection, malignancies, thromboembolic events, and lab abnormalities were also reported.More information about the ALLEGRO Phase 2b/3 trial can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.ALLEGRO-LT is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, long-term study to investigate the safety and efficacy of LITFULO in adults with alopecia areata with 25% or greater hair loss and adolescents from 12 years of age with alopecia areata with 50% or greater hair loss.About LITFULO™ (Ritlecitinib)LITFULO is an inhibitor of JAK3 and the TEC family kinases. Inhibition of JAK3 and TEC kinase family members by LITFULO may block signaling of cytokines and cytolytic activity of T cells, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.6,7,8,9Regulatory applications for LITFULO in alopecia areata have been submitted to countries around the world for review, including China, the European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ritlecitinib with a decision anticipated in the third quarter of 2023.LITFULO is also being evaluated for vitiligo, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis.INDICATIONLITFULO is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years and older.Limitations of Use: Not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators, cyclosporine or other potent immunosuppressants.US IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONLITFULO may cause serious side effects, including:Serious infections. LITFULO can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Do not start LITFULO if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. Some people have had serious infections while taking LITFULO or other similar medicines, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body, and have been hospitalized. Some people taking similar medicines to LITFULO have died from these infections. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster).Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting treatment with LITFULO and should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with LITFULO.Before and after starting LITFULO, tell your doctor right away if you have an infection, are being treated for one, or have symptoms of an infection, including:fever, sweating, or chillsmuscle achescough or shortness of breathblood in your phlegmweight losswarm, red, or painful skin or sores on your bodydiarrhea or stomach painburning when you urinate or urinating more often than usualfeeling very tiredLITFULO can make you more likely to get infections or worsen infections you have. If you get a serious infection, your healthcare provider may stop treatment with LITFULO until your infection is controlled.There is an increased risk of death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. LITFULO is a kinase inhibitor.Cancer and immune system problems. LITFULO may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen. People, especially current or past smokers, have a higher risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma and lung cancers, while taking a JAK inhibitor. Follow your healthcare provider’s advice about having your skin checked for skin cancer during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.There is an increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people 50 years and older who have at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a JAK inhibitor, especially for current or past smokers.Get emergency help right away if you have any symptoms of a heart attack or stroke while taking LITFULO, including:discomfort in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes backsevere tightness, pain, pressure, or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jawpain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomachshortness of breath with or without chest discomfortbreaking out in a cold sweatnausea or vomitingfeeling lightheadedweakness in one part or on one side of your bodyslurred speechBlood clots. Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT), lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE), or eyes can happen in some people taking LITFULO. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the veins of the legs and lungs have happened more often in people 50 years and older, with at least one heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor, taking a JAK inhibitor. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had blood clots in the past.Stop taking LITFULO and get medical help right away if you have any signs and symptoms of blood clots, including swelling, pain, or tenderness in one or both legs; sudden, unexplained chest or upper back pain; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; or changes in vision, especially in one eye only.Allergic reactions. Symptoms that may mean you are having an allergic reaction have been seen during treatment with LITFULO. Some of these reactions were serious. Stop taking LITFULO and get emergency medical help right away if you have symptoms of allergic reaction, including hives; rash; trouble breathing; feeling faint or dizzy; or swelling of your lips, tongue, or throat.Changes in certain laboratory test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start taking LITFULO and during treatment to check your lymphocyte and platelet counts and liver enzyme and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. You should not take LITFULO if your lymphocyte counts or platelet counts are too low or your liver tests are too high. Increased CPK levels in the blood are common with LITFULO and can also be severe. Your healthcare provider may stop treatment for a period of time if there are changes in these blood test results.Do not take LITFULO if you are allergic to ritlecitinib or any of the ingredients in LITFULO. See the Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients.Before taking LITFULO, tell your healthcare provider if you:have an infection, are being treated for one, or have one that won’t go away or keeps returninghave diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune systemhave TB or have been in close contact with someone with TBhave had shingles (herpes zoster)have had hepatitis B or hepatitis Clive, have lived, or traveled to certain areas (such as Ohio &amp; Mississippi River Valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections.

During the FDA committee meeting held last week, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their own vaccines, which target the XBB.1.5 variant. The preclinical data from these manufacturers indicate that a monovalent vaccine is more effective against a bivalent vaccine.Pfizer/BioNTech expects to make their updated vaccine ready for supply by the end of next month. Novavax stated that it is currently manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, intended to be in the market during the 2023 fall vaccination campaign.

(PFE) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-pfizer-inc-pfe-130013878.html,1687525213,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this drugmaker have returned +2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -69.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -49.5%. The $68.1 billion and $67.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -32.1% and -1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer.

151,e424375a-b0c4-3e98-b479-6dcc2e95a9bc,MPC,2023-06-24,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-trending-130011228.html,1687525211,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this refiner have returned +1.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has remained unchanged over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $4.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -55%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.01 points to a change of -27.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.61 indicates a change of -33.6% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $31.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -41.1%. The $136.17 billion and $124.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -24.3% and -8.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Yahoo Finance Automotive Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the rankings and some of the criteria.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Meantime, Pras, let's talk about JD Powell out with its initial quality study. What are some of the brands that perform the best?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, this is a pretty-- this is a widely followed kind of car tracking, sort of thing that people look at when they talk about quality, overall quality. This is initial quality first 100 days of ownership. And big day for Stellantis, right?So we saw Dodge. We saw Ram Trucks. We saw Alfa Romeo. All Stellantis brands. They're the top five most high initial quality. You see Buick and GMs Chevrolet rounding out the top five. So good news there for them.Now Dodge doesn't have that many vehicles in there. Sort of in their offering but still nonetheless, not bad. And what we're seeing across the board though, is what JD Powell is saying is there's actually more or less reliability these days overall compared to last year because of a lot of technical advancements that lead to sort of snafus and and bugs and things like that happened with these newer vehicles.Now what I see, the lower five or the bottom five are not that great here. Infinity, Audi, Volkswagen, those two brands are sort of known for a little bugs here, not including Volkswagen. Chrysler, a Stellantis brand, where it's mentioning down there on the bottom. And then also Volvo.JULIE HYMAN: There's one name that I don't think I've seen on any of these lists, the top five or the bottom five yet and that's Tesla.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, well, JD Powell did rank Tesla as-- it actually was an unranked brand there because they don't allow-- they don't allow people to-- sorry, they don't allow tracking of owners in states that don't authorize tracking, right? So in some states, if you don't authorize tracking, the automaker can say, hey, can we still track your initial quality? And they say yes. Tesla and Polestar don't allow that.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Ah, so when we talk about tracking, tracking of accidents, breakdowns, that kind of thing?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Oh, no, just like polling of their users based on what problems have you had with the car design-wise, infotainment-wise, that sort of thing. Some states don't need-- you need authorization from the brand to do that and Tesla won't allow that, right? So what happened that is that JD Powell then use survey data and other types of ways to project what that would be. And Tesla and Polestar both were below the bottom five brands. So they supposedly have a lot of initial quality issues but it's not part of an unranked-- it's an unranked brand there, both Tesla and Polestar.JULIE HYMAN: That is fascinating. Pras, thanks very much. Appreciate it.]"

It has aligned the software and services business around two key market opportunities — Cybersecurity and Internet of Things (IoT).BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS SurpriseBlackBerry Limited Price and EPS SurpriseBlackBerry Limited price-eps-surprise | BlackBerry Limited QuoteFactors to NoteHigher billings growth and rising demand for IoT solutions are likely to have driven BlackBerry’s fiscal first-quarter performance. Consistent design wins for the BlackBerry QNX platform are likely to have acted as tailwinds. The company is witnessing higher uptake of QNX in medical and industrial vertical apart from automotive sector.In the last reported quarter, BlackBerry highlighted that its IoT business segment achieved record QNX design wins, with royalty backlog reaching $640 million at the end of the fiscal year. Its QNX platform secured 36 new design wins with six in Auto and 30 in the General Embedded Market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For fiscal first quarter, management expects revenues from this segment in the range of $50-$53 million.However, global macroeconomic weakness and lingering supply-chain issues are affecting global auto production volumes. Weak macro environment is also weighing on BlackBerry’s Cybersecurity business as clients continue to optimize budget spending.  Nonetheless, the performance of Cybersecurity is likely to have been cushioned by healthy demand for its unified endpoint security products as well as Cylance product line. The company is also witnessing increasing client base within government and financial services’ verticals. For fiscal first quarter, BlackBerry expects Cybersecurity revenues to increase sequentially and to be between $100 million and $110 million.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for BlackBerry this time around.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGeneral Mills, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderGeneral Mills’ Accelerate strategy has been aiding growth for a while. The strategy helps the company make the choices of how to win and where to play to boost profitability while enhancing shareholder returns in the long run.Under how to win, General Mills is focused on brand building, undertaking innovations, unleashing scale and maintaining business strength. The where to play principle is outlined to enhance the company’s capabilities to generate profitability through geographic and product prioritization, along with portfolio restructuring. This includes prioritizing investments, investing in five Global Platforms, driving growth in Local Gem brands and reshaping the portfolio.General Mills has been seeing strength in its Pet segment, backed by enhanced customer service, improved brand-building and other commercial activities. The higher pet population and more humanization and premiumization of pet food have been acting as tailwinds for the company’s pet food category.Apart from this, the company’s Holistic Margin Management and Strategic Revenue Management initiatives to counter inflation have been working well. On its third-quarter earnings call, management stated that it still expects the biggest factors impacting its show in fiscal 2023 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, cost inflation and the severity and frequency of supply-chain bottlenecks.For fiscal 2023, management expects input cost inflation of 14-15% percent of the total cost of goods sold. It also expects moderately reduced supply-chain hurdles while anticipating greater investments in brand-building and other growth-driving initiatives compared with the year-ago period. These aspects may have affected profits in the quarter under review.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for General Mills this time.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the 'Dogs of the S&amp;P 500' strategy and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Dogs of the S&amp;P 500 stocks. 'Dogs of the S&amp;P 500' is a variation of the 'Dogs of the Dow' strategy applied to the S&amp;P 500 index. It involves selecting the highest dividend-yielding stocks from the S&amp;P 500 as a potential investment strategy. Dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks as it represents the annual dividend payout as a percentage of a stock price. Though high-yielding dividend stocks are often considered risky investments, meticulous research of the respective company’s financial health may mitigate risks associated with high yields.According to analysts' opinions, dividend yields ranging from 3% to 6% are generally considered favorable. This range often indicates a balance between income and potential growth. Companies offering dividend yields in this range typically have stable and sustainable business models that generate consistent profits. In our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investors Should Know, we mentioned Nuveen’s data which highlighted that dividend growers with modest yields achieved a return on equity of 26.8% in 2022. This outperformed stocks with higher yields above 3%, which had a return on equity of 20.4%.Also read: 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend GrowthA significant amount of research has been carried out on the Dogs of the Dow, a strategy that invests in the ten highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The majority of these studies point to the strategy’s tendency to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over long periods. However, the highest-yielding stocks of the S&amp;P 500 saw a substantial boost in performance over the years when pitted against their DJIA counterparts. Columbus State University’s paper, The Dogs of the Dow Strategy Applied to the S&amp;P 500, revealed that high-dividend S&amp;P 500 stocks delivered higher raw returns than both the Dogs of the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 over 18 years (from 2000 to 2017). According to the report, the Sector Dogs, the five highest-yielding dividend stocks of the S&amp;P 500, delivered average monthly returns of 0.960%, compared with 0.749% returns of Dogs of the Dow. The paper also mentioned that Sector Dogs’ buy and hold returns during this period came in at 12.62%, in comparison with a 4.9% return of the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesTo determine the performance of the highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks, ALPS implemented a variation of the Dogs of the Dow strategy through its Sector Dividend Dogs ETF. In this strategy, the selected the five companies with the highest dividend yields from each of the eleven sectors within the index.

Reliable infrastructure allows for supply chains to link up and efficiently move goods and services across various locations. Households are connected to major metropolitan areas where greater job opportunities are present and thus, allow for an increasing pool of talent, decreasing unemployment. Similarly, broadband services allow for greater remote connections than ever before, and in a world where remote working is becoming more and more common, can also directly result in higher employment and better standards of living even in remote areas. This is why many developing economies attempt to spend heavily on infrastructure and companies, while the poorest countries in the world are known for their lack of proper infrastructure.20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the USIn the U.S., the debate on railroads, which are a crucial part of the country's economic stability, raged in late 2022 when railroad workers threatened a strike, and the shutdown would have cost billions of dollars in damage at the very minimum to the nation's economy, which was already battling an impending recession because of high inflation and hiking of interest rates. Even though the top railroads in the country, some of which are also among the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., earned soaring profits in 2022, none of this was transmitted to the labor, the backbone of the industry. The railroad workers demanded better pay, improved working conditions and paid time off. Generally, the government can't do much to stop protests and strikes under expression of free speech, but the railroad industry works a little differently. Because of an almost century old arcane law that governs only airlines and railroads, what should have been an economic issue became a political one, and allowed the government to intervene.Story continuesBecause of The Railway Labor Act, the House committee was able to impose the same contract terms on railroad workers that they had firmly rejected, and this was swiftly followed by confirmation in the Senate. After that, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the measure in December 2022, and thus, the possibility of a strike was averted even though railroad workers were not happy with the package they were getting. The strike would have resulted in almost 30% of the country's freight shipments coming to a halt, and would likely have directly increased inflation. While the end result was excellent for some of the largest infrastructure companies in the U.S. and shareholders, the news was not good for those forced to work for these companies in such conditions.According to UBS, infrastructure industry performance in 2022 remained stable even as global economic turmoil continued to rise. The main aim of the infrastructure industry, and the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., is to continue increased focus on digitization and decarbonization, two of the most important cornerstones in terms of assessing a company's outlook and growth potential as financials alone are no longer sufficient to determine whether a company is a good option for investment. While most infrastructure companies have maintained stability, those engaged in the oil and gas sector have deliver robust growth as energy prices sky-rocketed as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, this growth does not seem to very sustainable as oil prices have already dropped significantly from their peak and commodities are expected to be moderate in both 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, private infrastructure companies are in the spotlight currently as they have demonstrated resilience even in a turbulent market and have been considered great opportunities for investment right now.Summarizing their results in 2022 and outlook for 2022, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), one of the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings transcript ""However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to slide eight. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment.""The biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. have combined revenues in excess of $520 billion annually, while their market cap exceeds $862 billion.

CSX will convert the locomotive at CSX’s locomotive shop in Huntington, West Virginia.“CSX looks forward to working as a partner with CPKC in the development of the hydrogen locomotive program as it demonstrates our commitment to implementing alternative fuel solutions that could further enhance our emissions performance and offer our customers an even more environmentally-friendly transportation solution,” CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs said in the news release. “This exciting initiative will greatly benefit from the expertise of CSX’s advanced, large-scale facilities, where the locomotives will be built.”The freight rail industry, including the Class I railroads, have been working to develop greener locomotive technologies, such as hydrogen-powered locomotives and locomotives that run on biodiesel, as part of a wider effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.CP’s plans to retrofit a diesel-electric locomotive so that it can become a line-haul, hydrogen-powered locomotive began in December 2020. The retrofit consists of using hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive a locomotive’s electric traction motors. CP developed an in-house prototype in late 2021, and by late 2022, the locomotive made its first revenue moves and has accumulated more than 1,000 miles of testing in revenue service, according to Thursday’s news release.

164,b7a293f6-ecd2-367c-ab82-3555af5f80e1,RCL,2023-06-24,Cruise Industry Riding on High Demand: 3 Stocks to Benefit,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cruise-industry-riding-high-demand-162600599.html,1687537560,STORY,"['CUK', 'RCL', 'NCLH']","[The cruise industry's toughest days appear to be behind it. The industry demonstrated resiliency on the back of the shift in customers’ preferences toward leisure travel and ongoing demand creation rate.Pent-up demand for cruise vacations and the fine-tuning of individual brand positioning and marketing initiatives are likely to have opened the way for the addition of more first-time cruise guests. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (or CLIA) report, the number of passengers sailing on cruises is expected to increase by 106% from 2019 levels to 31.5 million. In contrast, the UNWTO predicted in January 2023 that foreign visitor arrivals will be between 80% and 95% of 2019 levels in 2023.What’s Driving the Industry?Businesses continue to implement strategic initiatives across their operations to boost operational effectiveness and appropriately size their cost base to rebuild and increase profits. While preserving the outstanding guest experience and superior service levels, they are making conscious efforts to increase margins.Major cruise companies have deployed strategic investment plans to expand and renew their fleet. This includes luxurious accommodations, world-class dining options, captivating entertainment and a wide range of recreational activities.Backed by the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem and the efficiency in the respected company’s financial structure, new ships are able to contribute immediately and expected to be important drivers of future earnings growth and margin expansion. According to the CLIA orderbook, 14 new ships that provide fresh itineraries and experiences will be put into service in 2023.The companies are emphasizing on onboard revenue generation. This serves as a real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially. Cruise operators are of the opinion that guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend significantly more than those who do not pre-book onboard activities.Going by the purview, companies are expanding the number of high-quality touch points they have with their customers (starting at the time of booking) to increase revenues and prepayment before a cruise. These players have started honing their digital performance marketing strategies, perfecting search engine optimization and testing fresh lead creation ideas. They have also emphasized on redesigning websites to increase online traffic, improve conversion and achieve higher pre-cruise onboard sales.Story continuesRoad AheadAlthough companies are bearing the brunt of a challenging macroeconomic environment, reinvestments in terms of advertisement and sales support are likely to be initiatives placed in the right direction.The ability to close the occupancy gap (from pre-pandemic levels) and successfully generate demand help these companies lower opaque channel activity and raise ticket pricing to counteract the negative effects of fuel price and currency fluctuations. Notably, much optimism prevails on account of new hardware, a strong pricing environment, and continued growth from onboard revenue areas.Per the report, the Cruise industry is expected to generate revenues of US$25.14 billion in 2023. By 2027, the market volume is anticipated to hit US$35.87 billion. This represents an annual revenue forecast expansion of 9.29% CAGR (2023-2027).Investing in the Consumer Discretionary sector might sound profitable right now, it is worth noting that the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is currently at the top 31% (with the rank of 79) of the 251 Zacks industries, which hints at further growth.3 Cruise Stocks to Watch Out ForGiven the backdrop, here are three cruise stocks that are likely to move higher in 2023. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 3 (Hold). These companies have witnessed a sharp rise in share price in the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL is poised to benefit from improvements in booking activities, e-commerce enhancements and fleet-expansion efforts. Also, the improved pricing environment and the continued strength in onboard revenue areas bode well. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported early consumer engagement, with about 2/3 of its guests purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings. This compares with 48% of guests reported in 2019. The company stated that every dollar of pre-cruse spending translates into approximately $0.70 of incremental spend (on board). Secular tailwinds, courtesy of the shift in consumers’ preferences from goods to entertainment and travel spending (24% higher than 2019 levels), added to the positives. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to boost guest repeat rates and spending.Royal Caribbean currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has gained 133.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15% growth. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RCL’s financial-year sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests an increase of 48.5% and 162.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH will likely benefit from strong booking activities, occupancy improvement and fleet-expansion efforts. During the first quarter of 2023, the company generated solid booking volumes, courtesy of strong demand in the WAVE season. The company stated that the cumulative booked position for 2023 are higher than 2019 levels. Also, it reported strength in advance ticket sales. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $3.4 billion, up 26% (from the previous quarter’s levels) and 60% (from 2019 levels). The company stated pricing levels to be elevated. The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods. Also, the emphasis on margin enhancement initiatives, such as corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and rationalization of product delivery, bodes well.Norwegian Cruise currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has gained 44.3% in the past year. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NCLH’s financial-year sales and EPS suggests an increase of 77.3% and 116.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Carnival Corporation &amp; plc CCL has been benefitting from strong demand for cruising, bundled package offerings and pre-cruise sales. Also, it stated the benefits of increased advertising activities. During the fiscal first quarter, the company reported solid bookings for the North America and Australia (NAA) and Europe segments. The company stated that its NAA bookings curve mirrored peak 2019 levels, while the European recovery trajectory was more than 80% of 2019 levels. The company stated that its 2023 cumulative advanced booked position is at increased prices compared with 2019 levels. The company intends to focus on strategic deployments (closer to guests’ home itineraries) and shorter-duration cruises to reduce the friction of air travel and boost the booking environment.Carnival currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has gained 45.3% in the past year. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s financial-year sales and EPS suggests an increase of 72.3% and 93.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growers and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the Future. Dividend Aristocrats are a group of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. These companies are typically well-established and have histories of stable earnings and cash flows. They have demonstrated their ability to generate profits even during economic downturns. This was validated during the high inflationary environment of last year when the S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. Moreover, these dividend growers surpassed other asset classes in 25 of the last 32 years. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with decades-long dividend growth streaks.In recent years, dividend investment has gained even more prominence as a popular strategy, primarily due to the market experiencing heightened periods of volatility. The S&amp;P 500 yearly dividend payouts have seen an upward trend over the years, jumping from $420 billion in 2017 to $522 billion in 2021, as we reported in our article 10 Dividend Stocks with 10%+ Yield. In 2022, the dividend payments reached their all-time high of $561 billion. This shows that by investing in dividend stocks, investors can benefit from potential long-term growth and income generation. Moreover, dividends represented a significant portion of the market’s total return in the past. Between 2013 and 2022, dividends accounted for approximately 17% of the total return generated by the S&amp;P 500 Index, according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Also read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According to AnalystsWhen we speak about the long-term growth potential of dividend stocks, reinvesting dividends is one way to allow for compounding returns over time. From 1978 through 2020, dividends and reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the market’s overall returns. This means that if someone had invested $10,000 and consistently reinvested the dividends earned, their initial investment would have grown to an impressive amount exceeding $1.2 million during this period.Story continuesThough growth tech stocks are stealing the limelight this year so far, dividend stocks still have the capacity to outshine as companies continue to increase their payouts. Analysts also support the projected strong performance of dividend growers this year. Ford Donohue, a financial advisor at Homrich Berg, emphasized the importance of dividend growth stocks in his May interview with Fortune:“A diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. “We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of a stock.”Similarly, Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin also spoke with Business Insider about dividend stocks' outlook this year and mentioned that the S&amp;P 500’s dividend-per-share (DPS) is anticipated to grow by 4% by 2024. He further mentioned that recent actions taken by companies suggest a favorable environment for dividend growth.10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Aristocrats in the FuturePhoto by NeONBRAND on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies from the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 14 years or more and are on the steady path to becoming dividend aristocrats.

The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, namely enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.Moreover, Snap-On is dedicated to various strategic principles and processes aimed at creating value in areas like RCI. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, alongside helping Snap-On boost sales and margins and generate savings.Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from continuous productivity and process improvement plans.

As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 80 bps year over year to 25.6%.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeDespite these upsides, Snap-On is not free from struggles. It continues to reel under macroeconomic headwinds, which are likely to persist in 2023. Rising cost inflation stemming from higher raw material expenses and other costs is likely to remain a deterrent.The unfavorable currency also remains concerning. In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s sales were affected by an unfavorable foreign currency of $24 million. Sales in the Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, Tools Group and Repair Systems &amp; Information Group segments included $12.5 million, $7.1 million and $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, respectively.Bottom LineAll said, Snap-On’s cost-cutting efforts, RCI plan and solid business momentum are likely to help sustain its momentum and offset inflation and currency woes.

It involves selecting the highest dividend-yielding stocks from the S&amp;P 500 as a potential investment strategy. Dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks as it represents the annual dividend payout as a percentage of a stock price. Though high-yielding dividend stocks are often considered risky investments, meticulous research of the respective company’s financial health may mitigate risks associated with high yields.According to analysts' opinions, dividend yields ranging from 3% to 6% are generally considered favorable. This range often indicates a balance between income and potential growth. Companies offering dividend yields in this range typically have stable and sustainable business models that generate consistent profits. In our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investors Should Know, we mentioned Nuveen’s data which highlighted that dividend growers with modest yields achieved a return on equity of 26.8% in 2022. This outperformed stocks with higher yields above 3%, which had a return on equity of 20.4%.Also read: 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend GrowthA significant amount of research has been carried out on the Dogs of the Dow, a strategy that invests in the ten highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

However, the highest-yielding stocks of the S&amp;P 500 saw a substantial boost in performance over the years when pitted against their DJIA counterparts. Columbus State University’s paper, The Dogs of the Dow Strategy Applied to the S&amp;P 500, revealed that high-dividend S&amp;P 500 stocks delivered higher raw returns than both the Dogs of the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 over 18 years (from 2000 to 2017). According to the report, the Sector Dogs, the five highest-yielding dividend stocks of the S&amp;P 500, delivered average monthly returns of 0.960%, compared with 0.749% returns of Dogs of the Dow. The paper also mentioned that Sector Dogs’ buy and hold returns during this period came in at 12.62%, in comparison with a 4.9% return of the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesTo determine the performance of the highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks, ALPS implemented a variation of the Dogs of the Dow strategy through its Sector Dividend Dogs ETF. In this strategy, the selected the five companies with the highest dividend yields from each of the eleven sectors within the index. In the past three years ending March 31, 2023, the exchange-traded fund delivered a 23.01% return to shareholders, whereas the broader market gained 18.60% during this period.

189,0b962d9e-c059-3a8c-8c00-c56d5ed48ccf,TRV,2023-06-24,15 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-auto-insurance-companies-201334116.html,1687551214,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'ALL', 'MET', 'KMPR', 'TRV']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 largest auto insurance companies in the US. To skip our industry discussion and see the 5 largest companies, you can go directly to go to 5 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The US.The significant technological advances being made in the automobile industry, namely the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, are bound to have an impact on another sector: the auto insurance sector. These changes result in different customer needs and demands, which means that auto insurers will have to adapt to the times if they wish to stay relevant in this modern technological era.Potential Growth For The Auto Insurance SectorAccording to Ernst &amp; Young, evolving mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations are now beginning to challenge the legacy business models put forth by auto insurance companies. These challenges are forcing these companies to change the way they work and the type of work they do if they wish to adapt to a shrinking market size. Ernst &amp; Young believes that by 2035, the changes felt in mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations will shrink the market available to auto insurance companies by 31%. They are also expected to bring in newer competition, especially against older and more traditional insurers, while also transforming the way insurance is distributed, underwritten, and serviced.In light of these factors, financial professionals today see insurance companies, and even companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), that offer a diverse range of insurance products, as going through a radical transformation during the next few years. Ernst &amp; Young recommends that insurance carriers should begin to act now and fast to build business-to-business (B2B) distribution partnerships while also maximizing the benefits of telematics for their own gain.Changing Trends In The Automobile and Auto Insurance SectorsAccording to an article published by McKinsey in September, three major technologies will change the way the auto insurance sector operates in the next few years. These technologies, namely autonomous driving, connectivity, and embedded telematics, are said to be responsible for shaping the future of mobility and global auto insurance. McKinsey believes that not only will these technologies result in changing dynamics within the auto insurance industry, but they will also result in the same for original equipment manufacturers.Story continuesThe impact of these new technologies on original equipment manufacturers relates to the increased access these companies will have to their customers and to vehicle data. This increased access also means that disintermediate insurers would be placed at a disadvantage in comparison to original equipment manufacturers. However, the article also notes that those insurance companies that manage to capitalize on insurance based on real-time vehicle usage can also be at a significant advantage if they play their cards right.It cannot be disputed that new technologies that have made autonomous driving a real-life possibility today will have a significant impact on the auto insurance sector, and this impact may not be entirely positive. With more people opting for autonomous or self-driving cars, the frequency of car accidents is expected to decrease drastically. In light of this development, auto insurance is beginning to move towards becoming a ""predict and prevent"" product, according to the McKinsey article. Another key point from the article that is worth noting is that with the rise of autonomous vehicles, insurance liability is also being shifted from human operators to commercial parties that are responsible for the manufacture of autonomous vehicles and their technology.All of the above shows only the beginning of the impact the auto insurance industry is bound to feel in the face of these new technological advancements. The way these advancements affect the sector is bound to show within the general performance of the property and casualty insurance sector at large. This is a sector that we have covered in another article before, where we highlight current dynamics within the sector and the growth it has been exhibiting. It is worth noting that despite skepticism surrounding the auto insurance industry today in light of the changing dynamics we have mentioned above, there is also a significant degree of widespread optimism among the financial public when it comes to the property and casualty insurance sector. Keeping this in mind, we felt that it would be worth compiling a list of the biggest auto insurance companies in the US today.15 Largest Auto Insurance Companies In The USPhoto by carlos aranda on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo select the companies for our list below, we decided to pick market share in the auto insurance market as a ranking criterion.

191,6aa40f46-c818-3bf0-914d-4b925ba70b9a,GPC,2023-06-24,Why Its Worth Taking a Closer Look at the Automotive Aftermarket,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-worth-taking-closer-look-201800281.html,1687551480,STORY,['GPC'],"[The US aftermarket for automotive parts and components is neither too consolidated nor too fragmented, since it includes both tier-1 and tier-2 component manufacturers as well as a large number of smaller, often less organized, players. In addition to expanding their product portfolios and increasing their production capacity, players often partner with large local dealers and engage in strategic M&amp;A to increase their geographical reach/distribution networks, capture additional market share and gain a competitive edge. Because of the large number of players, the competitive landscape is determined by product range, quality and pricing. Digital commerce is increasingly becoming an important factor determining sales.Growth ProspectsAccording to a report by Persistence Market Research, the global market for automotive aftermarket parts is expected to reach $ 984.12 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2023 to 2033.The Asia Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing market, followed by North America and Europe. Because of increased urbanization and improvement in the standard of living in the region, consumption of passenger cars and commercial vehicles is on the rise. This creates increased scope for parts manufacturers. The growing preference for after-market parts from third parties over parts from the manufacturer (OEM) is also an important driver for this industry. (Persistence Market Research)Performance parts, i.e. those high-performance parts that are not manufactured by OEMs but are often priced at a premium because of their quality and uses, are estimated to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% between 2022 and 2032 by Future Market Insights.Strength in the parts market is also determined by the age of existing cars. The pandemic led consumers to keep their cars longer, since they were not using them as much anyway. But post-pandemic, there was a surge in demand for cars both old and new, which was also positive for parts sales.Story continuesHowever, market research from IHS Markit indicates that this trend will continue over the next few years at least. The research firm estimates (as quoted by supplychainbrain) that the average vehicle age was 11.9 years in 2020, 12.1 years in 2021 and en route to reach 12.6 years by 2025. Stronger and better-made cars, the remote working trend and online shopping are expected to be the main reasons for this.Supply chain imbalances ensued after the great reopening, spurred by chip shortages, labor shortages and transport bottlenecks. All of these factors limited availability and drove up freight costs. As a result, fewer new cars were built (with longer term negative impact on parts makers) and demand for used cars skyrocketed (with positive implications for parts makers). However, since these conditions also impacted raw material availability for parts makers, they couldn’t make the most of the opportunity.A prospective growth driver for parts makers is the electric vehicle EV market, where government mandate, individual concern and corporate competition is combining to generate significant investment and sales. Parts makers face a challenge with respect to this market, since EVs have fewer spare parts that can be replaced.This doesn’t mean that there will be fewer opportunities but just that the opportunity will be of new variety. McKinsey’s Automotive Software and Electronics 2030 report says that trends in the autonomous driving connected vehicles, electrification of the powertrain and shared mobility (ACES) market during the forecast period will contribute to a 7% CAGR in automotive software, as well as electrical and electronic components, outpacing the overall growth in the automotive market.Packaging of EV components potentially expands the TAM for players. According to “supplychainbrain”: “On the surface, it may seem problematic for the aftermarket industry that electric vehicles (EV) and smart cars have significantly fewer parts than internal combustion engine vehicles. However, while they are fewer, they may be lighter, more fragile and more expensive, so it’s critically important to provide consistent, precise protection for these parts, like the protection you’d find from a custom-engineered packaging solution.""It’s also important to note that the packaging you use for mechanical parts is not the same packaging you’ll need for high-value electronics parts, which require specially designed packaging to protect against shock, vibration, and electrostatic discharges. In addition, as OEMs compete for EV battery charge range, lightweighting of assembly parts is a common strategy to reduce overall car weight. These lighter body panels, windshields, and even tires are more delicate and thus require more specialized protection in transit.”Finally, while all the above factors are important and will drive sales, it’s important to remember that the customer base, including habits and preferences are changing. Therefore, companies without online presence (whether using a broader platform like Amazon or an in-house platform, or something in between, like a dealer’s website) will lose out.The DIY auto maintenance and repair trend adds another layer of complexity. Companies that offer the greatest choice to customers, including the ability to have their products shipped to their repair center of choice, to pick them up in-store, to request home delivery, or to schedule a mobile installation will obviously do better than those that don’t offer these choices.2 PicksGiven the strong growth prospects, I’ve picked three stocks that you may want to consider to gain exposure to this segment:CarGurus, Inc. (CARG)Cambridge, MA-based CarGurus is an online automotive marketplace that facilitates the connection between buyers and sellers of new and used cars globally.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The use of electronic bill of lading (eBOL) capabilities is gaining steam throughout the less-than-truckload industry, the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) said Friday.The goal is to create one industrywide standard for carriers, shippers and 3PLs, eventually replacing the various digital platforms used today. The NMFTA’s Digital LTL Council has been working on the initiative, which utilizes application programming interfacing, since 2019.The council called on members last year to pledge adoption of the technology by July 20, 2023. The goal is to make the LTL industry “more efficient and produce a more fluid supply chain through digitization.”“The companies who have led the way on this are already seeing a return on the investment,” said Paul Dugent, the Digital LTL Council’s executive director. “This confirms what we have understood all along — that the eBOL standard is essential for the LTL industry in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and overall operational excellence.”The group said improvement has been seen in communication between shippers and carriers regarding shipment types, details and the equipment that will be required to facilitate loadings. Many of the nation’s largest LTL carriers are already using the new eBOL standard.Broker C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) is using the eBOLs with most of the carriers on its platform, according to the news release.“Because of our scale and our relationships with nearly every LTL carrier in the industry, for us to work on initiatives to reduce costs, phone calls, and administration is extremely impactful,” Greg West, C.H. Robinson’s vice president of LTL, stated in the news release. “We prioritized this because we saw the opportunity to eliminate unnecessary work and achieve real performance gains.Transportation technology providers like SMC³ and project44 have adopted eBOLs as well.“The eBOL standard ensures shippers do not have to wait for the freight bill to be manually entered, which typically takes place at the end of business each day, minimizes keying errors, and results in an earlier confirmation of an actual pickup,” stated Brad Berlin, senior manager of carrier engagement at project44.Story continuesThe Digital LTL Council is now working on a project that will determine the APIs needed to completely digitize shipment data from “creation to cash.”“We want the whole industry enjoying these benefits of efficiency, accuracy, and operational excellence. That’s why we established the eBOL standard in the first place. The deadline is looming, but we are confident the industry will rise to meet it,” said Debbie Ruane Sparks, the NMFTA’s executive director.The NMFTA is a trade group that manages the classification system used to universally code and identify each shipment in the industry.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenXPO finishes expansion project in Salt Lake CityYellow asks to defer health care, pension contributionsRoadrunner adds lanes into Virginia, Las VegasFireside chat: Digital transformation trends in the industryThe post NMFTA touts success of electronic BOLs ahead of implementation date appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

For some more prominent movies in this list, head on over to the 10 Best Movies of all Time.Exceptional films typically excel in various aspects, encompassing compelling writing, captivating music, and memorable performances that often reach iconic status. Ultimately, determining what makes a movie great is subjective, and there isn't a single definitive answer, just as there isn't a singular category for remarkable films. Naturally, movies have evolved significantly from the days of 50-second reels, making ranking the best movies of all time seem even more impossible. With the abundance of films now readily available for streaming from the comfort of home, the options for discovering quality movies are virtually limitless.The film industry or motion picture industry includes commercial and technological companies which specialize in cinematography, film studios, production companies, film production, animation, pre-and post-production, film festivals, and distributors. All of these things together are the filmmaking industry. Today, the movie/cinema industry is not only limited to theaters, but OTT platforms are majorly contributing to the overall revenues of films.Based on a report by The Motion Pictures Association (MPA), the Global Theatrical and Home Entertainment market experienced steady growth from 2016 to 2019. During this period, the market comprised three sectors: Physical, Digital, and Theatrical, with respective values of $8.8 billion, $47.2 billion, and $42.3 billion in the final year of growth. However, the sector faced a significant downturn the following year due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, experiencing an 18% drop to $80.8 billion. This shift caused a major disruption within the industry, as the Theatrical segment plummeted to $12 billion, while the Digital segment surged to $61.8 billion. A different report from Gower Street suggests that the global box office market can grow to $29 billion by the end of this year if it maintains a 12% growth rate, which will still be slower than the 21% growth rate achieved last year. At the same time, Gower Street points out that even if the global box market does grow to $29 billion, it will still be significantly less than the $42.3 billion that it was worth in 2019. Story continuesStreaming, also known as video on demand, has become a prevalent global phenomenon. It was not long ago that the concept of a laptop or smartphone serving as a gateway to vast entertainment platforms, offering an abundance of TV shows and movies at our fingertips, seemed unimaginable. However, we now find ourselves in a reality where the industry not only generates substantial revenue but also demonstrates immense potential for further growth, as demonstrated by the success of streaming services such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, and The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+.While the global streaming market is also made up of other sectors such as healthcare streaming, the video-on-demand subsector is an accurate indicator of pureplay content streaming. On this front, Fortune Business Insights estimates that this market was worth $69.55 billion in 2021 and grew to $82.77 billion in 2022. From then on, it is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 17.6% to be worth $257 billion by the end of 2029.We believe this is actually where most of the value can be realized by movie producers. We believe, eventually, that there will be major consolidation in the streaming industry and with one company serving the entire world with a market capitalization of north of $5 trillion dollars. We believe the winner is likely to be one of Apple Inc. (AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). We don't yet know who the winner will be, but the companies who hold the rights to the 50 best movies of all time that we shared below and other irreplaceable content will be richly rewarded.50 Best Movies of all TimePhoto by JESHOOTS.COM on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo start off our list of the best movies of all time, we first looked at IMDB's expansive list of movies, and then ranked the top 50 according to their respective scores.  The compiled selection consists of contemporary gems such as the acclaimed ""Interstellar"" and ""Parasite,"" which have earned Oscars in recent years, alongside timeless classics like ""The Godfather"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

So she hasn't had exactly the opportunity yet to really turn things around.DIANE KING HALL: It's true. And she will have to focus along with the rest of the executive team on dealing with those inventory issues. We saw those issues come up with Nike as well.

The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) has grown to become a cornerstone of the future of accessible and affordable broadband in this country.Earlier today, the administration officially launched the Online For All campaign with an event in Towson, Maryland at the local branch of the Baltimore County Public Library. During the event, White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu and FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel underscored the importance of the ACP and challenged all of us to reach even more people with the program, which provides a $30 per month credit ($75 per month on Tribal lands) toward Internet bills.Just this year, we provided a grant to the library to train Digital Navigators, and an additional grant to the Community College of Baltimore County to employ these local experts to help folks get connected.$11.4M in grants awarded in 2022 for ACP awareness and Digital Navigators225+ organizations supported around ACP and broadband adoption effortsWe are proud to serve as the founding partner of the new Civic Nation and U.S. Department of Education campaign, Online For All, which will supercharge efforts across government, private industry, nonprofits, and community partners nationwide to connect more people to the Internet.While it's impressive that more than 18.5 million households have signed up for the ACP benefit so far, the next phase of this effort will be more challenging. With more than 31 million households eligible for the ACP, but not yet enrolled, our attention must now turn toward broadband adoption.Comcast's decade of experience working in this space has given us the data and know-how to pursue this task head-on. Through Project UP, we have a network of hundreds of partner organizations across our footprint, working in cities and towns from coast to coast on broadband adoption and ACP awareness.Story continuesIn fact, in 2022 alone, Comcast invested $11.4 million in more than 225 nonprofits and community-based organizations to raise awareness of, and drive sign-ups for, the ACP. And that includes investing in training and deploying Digital Navigators, a key piece of the solution. As trusted local experts, usually associated with existing organizations like churches and community centers, Digital Navigators can get folks signed up for Internet service, connect them with devices, and show them the rules of the road when it comes to staying safe online.Which brings us to this ACP Week of Action. Together with other companies and partners, we're joining the activation from June 14-22 to shine a light on the truly transformative nature of the ACP - connecting people to the Internet at virtually no cost to them, especially those who can benefit most. I've seen this firsthand as I've visited the communities we serve to learn more.For the week of action, Comcast is continuing to work with national and local partners to drive participation in the ACP. We're hosting events to drive ACP enrollment, embedding connectivity information into other events we're sponsoring, and sharing stories of our customers whose lives have changed with low or no-cost Internet.Check out a sampling of over 100 events Comcast is participating in during the week of action and beyond below:On June 14, Comcast will be hosting an ACP sign-up event and offering technology assistance at Plymouth Housing in Seattle to help connect residents to high-speed Internet.On June 14, Comcast will be participating in ""Career Day"" in Boston's Chinatown Neighborhood Center to raise awareness of digital equity and the ACP.On June 16, Comcast will be a participating sponsor of the Latin American Community Ciencias (Science) Night at Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) in Portland, OR. This family-friendly event welcomes visitors of all ages for a night of museum exploring science demos, lectures, and cultural entertainment. Comcast will increase awareness of the ACP and Internet Essentials at the event.On June 21 at the Association of Washington Cities (AWC) Annual Conference in Spokane, WA, Comcast is bringing together two conversations with state and local leaders about digital equity and the ACP.On June 27, Comcast will be participating in the Leon County Digital Equity Forum to raise awareness of ACP and Digital Navigators in Tallahassee, FL.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy and Executive Vice President, Digital Equity for Comcast Corporation.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/763433/ACP-Week-of-Action-Comcasts-Commitment-to-Affordable-Connectivity-for-All]"
209,78e27ca8-f08d-3c9a-9a31-b6cca7a00960,CMCSA,2023-06-24,Wall Street Analysts Think Comcast (CMCSA) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-comcast-133006002.html,1687527006,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Comcast (CMCSA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Comcast currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CMCSABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CMCSACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Comcast here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Comcast, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CMCSA?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Comcast, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.75.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Comcast. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Comcast.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.77%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.65%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.23%.Heading into today, shares of the equipment rental company had gained 17.84% over the past month, outpacing the Construction sector's gain of 8.67% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.66% in that time.United Rentals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, United Rentals is projected to report earnings of $9.20 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 17.05%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.43 billion, up 23.96% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $39.70 per share and revenue of $14.15 billion, which would represent changes of +22.15% and +21.55%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for United Rentals. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. United Rentals is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that United Rentals has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.14 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.48.Story continuesMeanwhile, URI's PEG ratio is currently 0.62. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Building Products - Miscellaneous was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.72 at yesterday's closing price.The Building Products - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Construction sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 42, putting it in the top 17% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The bulls appear to be in control heading into the heart of the summer.Instead of attempting to chase the handful of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared already, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying large-cap stocks still trading 30% to 50% below their record highs heading into July.The bulls reasserted themselves on Thursday. The Nasdaq opened lower, but it only stayed red for a little while before buyers rushed in and turned up the heat in the afternoon, pushing the tech-heavy index to close nearly 1% higher. The solid day was driven by gains from Tesla, Amazon, and others. The S&amp;P 500 eventually ended the session up 0.4%, after it opened lower and swung between small gains and losses.The upbeat day ended a miniature skid and helps keep both indexes near 52-week highs. Investors likely want to keep a close eye on the 4,300 level for the S&amp;P 500, as it might be a line the bulls have to hold as Wall Street enters the heart of the summer and more investors call for a mega-cap tech pullback.That said, even if the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq experience a downturn it might be driven by profit-taking on Nvidia and others. On top of that, different areas of the market are finally gaining some momentum as more investors and money come in off the sidelines.Investors who can stomach the possibility of more near-term risks might decide now is time to start buying beaten-down large cap names that trade miles below their highs even as Nvidia, Apple, and others break new ground. Remember, some of the best times to buy stocks is when seemingly no one else does.Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) is a technology firm that’s thrived as one of the largest makers of microinverter-based solar and battery systems in the world. Inverters are vital high-tech components in the solar ecosystem because they convert the DC power that solar panels produce into the AC power used in our homes and businesses. The solar energy market is well established in the U.S. and across many other countries. Plus, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into solar energy expansion as part of an evolving energy landscape.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEnphase topped our EPS estimate once again in late April, but it provided downbeat guidance as it faces near-term setbacks in the U.S. ENPH stock has been crushed in 2023 based on its subdued outlook and overall slowing growth as it comes up against a very difficult-to-compete-against stretch that saw it soar from around $300 million in sales in 2018 to $2.33 billion in 2022.Still, Zacks estimates call for Enphase’s revenue to climb from $2.33 billion to $3.10 billion in FY23, which would mark 33% sales growth and then post another 25% revenue expansion to reach $3.87 billion next year. Meanwhile, its adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by 20% and 35%, respectively. ENPH currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its adjusted EPS outlook has held up rather well considering the thrashing the stock has taken—with its outlook for FY23 and FY24 still up from where they were last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEnphase shares have soared roughly 2,200% in the last five years to double Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). This staggering run includes a 50% fall from its early December 2022 records. ENPH is now trading around where it was at the end of 2020 and nearly 60% below its average Zacks price target. Enphase is also trading at a 76% discount to its highs at 33X forward 12-month earnings.All that said, ENPH is hovering at a potentially worrisome level in the near term from a technical perspective, with the stock below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Investors might want to hold off until we see how Enphase trades in the coming days and weeks. But if it finds support at its 200-week moving average (nearby chart) it could be poised to start mounting a comeback.Public Storage (PSA) is one of the largest owners, operators, and developers of self-storage facilities on the planet, with nearly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy more stuff. Public Storage grew its revenue at a steadily impressive pace over the last 20-plus years, including 22% sales growth in 2022 (+15% comps) and 17% in 2021.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post another 7.4% revenue growth in FY23 and 5.2% in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to Covid. And Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by over 5% during both years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSA lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, with its bottom-line revisions stagnating recently. Public Storage’s FY23 and FY24 outlook does, however, remain solidly above where they were at the start of 2022. PSA flexed its financial firepower when it lifted its dividend by 50% back in February to help it yield 4.2% at the moment. PSA shares have climbed 735% over the last 20 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 350%. And Public Storage has climbed by 51% in the past three years to top the market’s 40% run. The outperformance includes the fact that Public Storage stock is down 30% from its April 2022 highs. PSA is currently trading 20% below its average Zacks price target. The stock is also sitting 20% below its own 10-year median and at a 40% discount to its highs at 16.8X forward 12-month earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike Enphase, Public Storage is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as sitting underneath its 50-week. The stock might have to find support at its 200-week moving average soon. And if it does, some investors might want to start buying PSA shares. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

However,  the annual profit that Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE: DRI) forecasted was largely below what Wall Street had expected with a clear warning of a slowdown in fine dining that is getting beaten by fast food chains like McDonalds Corporation (NYSE: MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Before its earnings report, the stock had been approaching its all-time high of $168.98 that was set on June 15th, but ended up falling more than 3% in morning trading.Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results Topped EstimatesDuring the quarter that ended on May 28th, revenue rose 6.4% as it amounted to $2.77 billion with LongHorn Steakhouse's same-store sales growing 7.1% while Olive Garden followed with 4.4%. While Olive Garden, who makes up about 45% of sales fell short of Street Account's 5% estimate, LongHorn Steakhouse exceeded expectations big time as StreetAccount expected 4.9%. The underperformer was the fine dining segment whose same-store sales dropped 1.9%.Results did not include Darden's $715 million purchase of Ruth’s Chris Steak House that was completed on June 14th. Labor inflation amounted to about 6% and dented margins, but also helped boost employee retention and improve service. Net income amounted to $315.1 million, or $2.58 per share, rising from last year's comparable quarter when it amounted to  $281.7 million, or $2.24 per share.2024 Fiscal Guidance Is What Disappointed InvestorsOrlando, Florida-based restaurant chain guided for full-year profit in the range between $8.55 per share and $8.85 per share with same-store sales growing from 2.5% to 3.5%. CFO Raj Vennam announced that menu prices will rise by 3.5% to 4% due to rising costs, particularly for labor, and therefore traffic for the year will likely be flat to 1.5% lower.Story continuesView more earnings on DRIDarden guided for net sales between $11.5 billion and $11.6 billion, with same-store sales growth between 2.5% and 3.5%. Along with capital spending of $550 million to $600 million and total inflation of 3% to 4%, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected between $8.55 and $8.85.Softer fine-dining sales are expected through the undergoing, fiscal first quarter but according to the CFO Raj Vennam, traffic will stabilize on a YoY basis afterwards.Comparison Has Been Made DifficultAs for the fine dining chains, it is important to note that during last year's comparable quarter, customers were going out to celebrate the departure of Omicron. Moreover, traffic at Darden's fine dining restaurants has more than doubled over the last three quarters when compared to 2019 levels. However, the chain observed the weakened demand for alcoholic beverages, while fine dining fell only for lower-income and younger age groups, while they flattened for higher income and older age groups. In both cases, the trends suggest a degree of price sensitivity, as CEO Ricardo Cardena concluded.Fast Food Over Fine DiningEven Darden's rival Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ: TXRH) is losing market share to fast-food chains such as McDonalds and Chipotle who are dominating the field. But Cardenas remains hopeful, as despite consumers prioritizing affordability in times of economic tension, they also go for the value and the experience. Yet, the latest reports do show that fast food chains like McDonalds and Chipotle,who are showing remarkable revenue and profit trends, are gobbling up restaurants who offer a full-service dining experience. From an investor perspective, there's a lot to like from McDonalds as it began 2023 by posting strong sales on top of last year's gains. Moreover, McDonalds is accelerating its gains and was even ahead of Chipotle in late April, comparable-store sales at McDonalds rose 13% in the quarter, while Chipotle experienced an 11% comps increase during its first quarter. McDonalds achieved a double win as it increased customer traffic while also raising prices. McDonalds is also a leader in the operating margin arena with its margin rising above 45% of sales, improving further from 2022's 40.4%. Although McDonalds gets to profit from its franchises through fees and royalty charges, its business momentum is all about the menu items and that 'something' customers like about its restaurants. Therefore, the concept of 'value and experience' is a topic to be explored in detail from the aspect of consumer behavior during challenging times as fast food chains seem to have that 'something' that consumers especially treasure when times are hard as otherwise, higher menu items would put them off.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

223,e54f917c-c229-37df-80ae-bee6360e2233,MCD,2023-06-24,Top 20 Countries With Highest Fast Food Consumption,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-countries-highest-fast-184713277.html,1687546033,STORY,"['MCD', 'DPUKY', 'CMG']","[In this article, we will be covering the top 20 countries with the highest fast food consumption. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food industry and consumption trends, go directly to the Top 5 Countries With Highest Fast Food Consumption.Fast food falls into the quick service restaurant (QSR) or limited-service restaurant industry (LSR) industry and is characterized by its emphasis on speed of service, affordability, standardized menus, and often, a drive-through or takeout service. A global phenomenon that is unlikely to change anytime soon, The success of fast food chains in the market can be attributed to their ability to tap into a large consumer base. These chains have expanded their operations globally and have maintained a strong presence in international markets for extended periods. As a result, renowned fast food brands like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), and The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) have gained widespread recognition and have cultivated a preference for their offerings worldwide, regardless of whether it's in developing or developed countries.Over the past few years, the fast food and casual restaurant industry, typically known for its quick and affordable meals, has witnessed a noticeable transformation, with the emergence of high-priced establishments alongside their more budget-friendly counterparts. Despite this, customers will continue to be loyal to brands that please them with a well-rounded and high-quality experience. Fast food enthusiasts appreciate the element of predictability, desiring a clear understanding of what awaits them prior to stepping foot inside a restaurant. Whether visiting McDonald's in New York City, Stockholm, or even Beijing, customers expect a consistent experience across locations,According to a research report, the global fast food industry was estimated at $ 702.8 billion in 2021 and it is expected to hit $ 964.6 billion by 2030 with a registered CAGR of 4.0% from 2022 to 2030. The fast food market is continuously developing due to rising demand for on-the-go snacks, convenience foods, and ready meals. The busy lifestyle of millennials and the worldwide rise of working people seem to be driving this impact on fast food consumption. Additionally, the significance of delivery options/services is also partially attributable to the rising number of restaurants, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG). This shift is fueled by the rising consumer demand for convenient and on-demand food delivery, coupled with the growing popularity of online food delivery platforms.Story continuesAccording to a study by The Barbecue Lab, most Americans eat fast food one to three times a week and over 83% of US families eat it at least once a week. The study suggests many people think eating fast food is “relatively inexpensive compared with other restaurants.” Over 32% of the people that eat fast food think it is cheaper than the alternatives. However, the cost of fast food is notably higher compared to preparing meals at home. Contrary to the common belief that lower-income families rely on fast food for its affordability, it is actually individuals with higher incomes who tend to consume more fast food than those with lower incomes.Top 20 Countries With Highest Fast Food ConsumptionCopyright: gdolgikh / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo rank the top 20 countries with the highest fast food consumption, we scoured through several studies and surveys that revealed the countries that consumed the most amount of fast food. Notably, the survey carried out by CEOWORLD magazine became the foundation for our rankings. To learn more about the fast food industry, you can check out our list of the 10 Best Fast Food Stocks to Invest In.20. GermanyGermany boasts a diverse restaurant scene, which comprised a total of around 70,619 establishments in 2019. Although there has been a slight decline in the number of restaurants in recent years, the industry remains highly competitive and vibrant, experiencing consistent revenue growth.19. CanadaOne of the countries with the highest fast food consumption, Canada employs more than 400,000 people within this lucrative industry, with an estimated 30% Canadians having worked in the fast food industry at some point. The Canadian fast food industry's value reached $27 billion in 2021. From 2016 to 2021, the industry witnessed a modest growth rate of 1.3%. However, post-pandemic, the fast food sector in Canada rebounded with a market growth of 8.2% in 2022, resulting in a market size of $29.8 billion. Additionally, the industry is predicted to continue growing and reach $55 billion by 2027.18. FinlandFinland has a unique fast food consumption pattern influenced by both local traditions and international influences. The impact of Covid-19 on the restaurant and café industry was nothing less than challenging, leading to reduced profits for many establishments. However, an interesting trend has emerged in Finland, where the pandemic seemed to have stimulated Finns' craving for fast food. One notable example is the local pizza chain, Kotipizza, which reported record-breaking sales in May of 2020. With a remarkable surge of 17% in revenues compared to the previous year, the company experienced a phenomenal 152% increase in online orders.17. JapanJapan is a gourmet country some of the highest fast food consumption, with traditional fast food options like ramen, yakitori, and ready-to-eat bento meals, as well as several international QSR chains. As of January 2023, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was the fast-food restaurant brand with the most operating stores in Japan, amounting to 2,959 facilities. Other leading brands include Hotto Motto, MOS Burger, and KFC.16. PortugalA southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal enjoys a vibrant food culture that has integrated both, cultural and international fast food options. In 2022, approximately one-third of the Portuguese population enjoyed dining out at restaurants or opted for take-away food once a week, while 14% indulged in this practice twice a week.15. SwitzerlandFast food consumption in Switzerland is a significant aspect of the country's culinary landscape. Despite consistently ranking as one of the healthiest and most environmentally friendly nations globally, a 2019 study conducted in the French-speaking region revealed that more than 69% of respondents felt no remorse, either for their personal well-being or for the environment, when indulging in burgers and fries. However, it should be noted that while fast food consumption is prevalent, Switzerland also emphasizes quality and variety in its food culture.14. RussiaFast food and full-service restaurants dominate the food market in Russia, with the fast food market measuring at over 2.2 billion orders in 2021, marking an increase from the previous year by more than four million orders. KFC is the most prolific American fast food brand in Russia with over around 1,000 units across the country. This is followed by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) with close to 847, and Burger King, which operates roughly 800 restaurants in Russia.13. IndiaThe rise in disposable income in India has led to a corresponding increase in the frequency of dining out. Major fast food chains, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), entered the Indian market in 1996, paving the way for other prominent establishments like Domino's, Pizza Hut, KFC, and more to follow suit. The countries quick-service restaurant market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 23% between now to fiscal year 2025.12. AustraliaDriven by their increasingly hectic lifestyles, Australians are allocating a greater portion of their budget to fast food and meals consumed away from home. According to a 2020 report, Australians make approximately 51.5 million monthly visits to fast food chains, accounting for nearly 32% of their household food budget dedicated to dining out. The market size, measured by revenue, of the Australian Fast Food and Takeaway Food Services industry was $7 billion in 2022.11. ItalyThe birthplace of pizza, Italy remains one of the top countries with the highest fast food consumption. Despite this, many of the world’s biggest fast-food chains are finding it difficult to survive in the Italian culinary market that features exquisite staples like pasta carbonara, lasagne, and saltimbocca. Burger King, for example, arrived in Italy in 1999, but still operates only 220 locations, making it the second-largest American fast-food chain in the country, considering Italy's population of 60 million residents. Additionally, Italy is home to only 50 KFC franchisees, 17 Subway locations, and 34 Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) stores.10. NorwayDespite being leaders in the war against obesity, with taxes over sugary drinks and fast food, Norwegians are one of the top 10 global consumers of fast food. However, Norway's fast food is considerably more nutritious than many of its competitors. In an economical environment that is anything but inexpensive, fast food provides an excellent opportunity for a quick and affordable takeaway snack. The local fast food scene revolves around a multitude of street kiosks and stalls known as ""gatekjøkken."" These establishments predominantly offer items such as hot dogs (varm pølse), which are often known for their slightly elastic texture. Alongside hot dogs, one can also find pizza slices, chicken pieces, and chips readily available.9. ChinaWhile Western giants like KFC and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) still dominate the market, Chinese brands have made rapid gains tapping into local tastes and preferences around fusion cuisine. The Fast-Food Restaurants industry in China is massive, generating an estimated $184.5 billion in 2022. The industry has performed well, with revenue expected to rise at an annualized 3.6% over the five years through 2022-2027.8. GreeceThe Greek traditional diet holds a significant position within the Mediterranean diet, renowned for its health benefits and protective effects against diseases like heart disease and cancer. Historically, the Greeks have maintained excellent health and life expectancy due to their dietary and lifestyle practices. In fact, the inhabitants of Crete, with a remarkable life expectancy of 82 years, boast the highest per capita consumption of olive oil in the world, reaching 25 liters. Despite the numerous advantages of the authentic Greek diet, there has been a shift in the eating habits of Greeks towards a more ""Westernized"" food consumption pattern, thus shifting away from the traditional plant-based diet with low saturated fat. Consequently, popular street-fast foods found in Greece nowadays include items such as ""gyros"" and ""souvlaki,"" burgers, pizzas, crepes, and sandwiches.7. South KoreaOne of the Asian nations that have seen extraordinarily quick economic development, modernization and Westernization over the past several decades, South Korea also ranks as one of the countries with the highest fast food consumption. The South Korea fast food market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% between 2023 and 2028. Busy lifestyles and the growing number of single households in South Korea are majorly driving the country's fast food market.6. MexicoThe fast food industry in Mexico has a significant economic value, estimated at MX$203 billion ($9.5 billion), and boasts an extensive network of over 262,000 sales points across the country. According to a report by Seale &amp; Associates, this sector was projected to grow by 3% annually, reaching a value of over MX$234 billion ($10.9 billion) by 2022. Another report by Merca 2.0 stated that 47.43% of consumers who dine outside their homes choose fast food establishments as their preferred option. Among the fast food chains in Mexico, Burger King holds the top position as the favorite restaurant among Mexicans, followed by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Subway, KFC, and Domino’s Pizza, Inc.

The company has a trailing four-quarter negative surprise of 6.9%, on average.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRite Aid Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRite Aid Corporation price-eps-surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteRite Aid’s Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments have been sluggish. RAD expects continued growth in comp sales and scripts in its core business. However, the company has been witnessing muted demand for flu immunizations and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the adverse impacts of closed stores, and reduced Elixir insurance memberships. Such factors are likely to have dented Rite Aid’s top-line performance in the fiscal first quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management indicated that the negative impacts of reimbursement rate declines, reduced demand for COVID-19 vaccines and testing, and lower revenues at Elixir are expected to hurt revenues throughout fiscal 2024. This is likely to have affected top-line performance in first-quarter fiscal 2024.The company expects COVID-19 vaccines and testing demand to decline, with COVID-19 vaccine administration expected to decrease from 5.1 million in fiscal 2023 to 3 million in fiscal 2024. Also, wage inflation and investments in the turnaround program are concerning. The impacts from these factors are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Rite Aid has been gaining from its expanded home delivery service to customers with an eligible prescription, with the benefit of a zero-delivery fee. It has also been providing pickup and drive-through services for prescriptions and over-the-counter products at its stores. RAD launched the Buy Online Pickup In Store initiative to offer better drive-through and curbside pickup options.The company has been focused on accelerating growth of riteaid.com’s e-commerce sales and expanding its buy online, pick up at store offerings. Continued strength in on-demand delivery, third-party marketplaces, and buy online, pick up at store options are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Rite Aid has been focusing on strengthening its foothold in mid-market PBM, innovating across its retail and mail-order pharmacy channels, enhancing the in-store experience by curating digital offerings, improving merchandise and rebranding its image with a new logo.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Rite Aid this time around.

NWL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 21, 2023 $1.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Newell Brands shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Newell Brands is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Consumer Products - Staples industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 35 cents per share to 13 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Newell Brands right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Call it a game of contract cat and mouse or not, but the Teamsters union strongly attacked UPS Inc.’s economic counterproposal as negotiations resumed in Washington to hammer out a new master contract.The company’s counterproposal “included minimal raises and overall wage cuts to workers’ cost-of-living adjustments,” the union said Thursday. The Teamsters National Negotiating Committee unanimously rejected what the union called a “disrespectful” package.The committee told UPS (NYSE: UPS) it will not meet again until the company makes a “realistic and respectful economic offer.” The union on Wednesday presented its initial economic proposal, which it called the “biggest, most lucrative financial proposal ever presented by a labor union.”It includes wage increases for each year of the five-year contract, additional holidays and more paid time off, pension increases, and the end of a two-tier wage system that the union says penalizes those who lack seniority even though they are performing the same work as their senior counterparts.“We are not accepting whatever crumbs these executives might throw our way. UPS has made plenty of money,” said Teamsters General Secretary Fred Zuckerman. “Our members have sacrificed everything to make them rich. We are demanding a real offer right now.”“If UPS wants to negotiate a contract for 1997 working conditions,” said General President Sean M. O’Brien, referring to the year the Teamsters struck UPS for 15 days. “They’re going to get 1997 consequences.”In a statement, UPS said that “as in any negotiations, reaching consensus on economic proposals requires serious and detailed discussion, as well as give-and-take from both sides. UPS is proud to provide the best pay and benefits package in the industry, and we plan to keep it that way. Both the Teamsters and UPS have publicly acknowledged the strong progress made to date, including the agreements reached on all non-economic topics. These negotiations affect our people, businesses and consumers across the country, which is a responsibility we take seriously.”Earlier, the Teamsters had announced that it and UPS had agreed to 55 non-economic contractual issues.The post Teamsters reject UPS’ first economic counterproposal appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)UPS Inc. and the Teamsters union have agreed to terms on 55 noneconomic issues in bargaining over a new master contract, but the hard work has just begun.Among the changes are the installation of air conditioners in package cars and other vehicles purchased after Jan. 1, 2024. Another requires that drivers not be forced to work more than 60 hours over a 70-hour workweek, though they could volunteer to do so.A third requires UPS (NYSE: UPS) to give the union 24 hours’ notice before a supervisor does a ride-along with a driver. A fourth designates areas for subcontractors to operate and requires them to leave the property after certain designated times.In addition, UPS may not subcontract feeder work if an available worker is laid off or is working out of classification.The next step is negotiation over wages, benefits and a controversial two-tier pay model, the most difficult part of the contract talks. The Teamsters submitted its economic proposal to UPS on Wednesday, and the union has made no secret it is seeking significant increases.UPS must tread lightly if it thinks it can pass on added labor costs to the Teamsters in the form of what Dean Maciuba, head of U.S. operations for Crossroads Parcel Consulting, called “punishing rate increases” without thinking it could lose business. FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX), UPS’ chief rival, is transforming itself into a lower-cost service provider, which is a “serious threat to UPS on a 2nd front,” Maciuba said in a LinkedIn post.However, FedEx executives said earlier this week that they have seen no material impact so far from concerns over a possible strike at UPS.Speaking Wednesday night on a webinar, Teamster General-President Sean O’Brien painted a two-road scenario in which either UPS agrees to Teamster demands or the company doesn’t and the union goes on strike Aug. 1, one day after the current contract expires. “We will leave everything on the field,” O’Brien said, adding that “we have to be united. We are setting a tone for the entire labor movement in the country.”The post UPS, Teamsters agree to 55 noneconomic contract issues appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Out of the total seven, two centers located in Tusculum and Murfreesboro will be grandly inaugurated this month and have already started operating from April 2023. The remaining five facilities will be located in Clarksville, Hermitage, Lebanon, Madison and Smyrna. The CenterWell centers will be equipped with board-certified physicians and experienced care teams, comprising nurses, medical assistants, clinical pharmacists, behavioral health specialists and referral specialists to impart the required treatment to the region’s senior population. Additionally, the facilities will also have activity centers for Middle Tennessee seniors.With the help of extended appointment times and a well-versed medical team, the ulterior motive of the centers is to take care of the patient’s physical, social and emotional needs, thereby addressing the whole-person health needs. This, in turn, is expected to bring about better health outcomes for the medically vulnerable as well as the underserved communities of the targeted region with the help of quality care access.The latest announcement is part of Humana’s promising expansion plans for the CenterWell brand in 2023, which it revealed last year. This month, CenterWell Senior Primary Care opened a facility in Texas that marked its 250th senior primary care facility. Increasing the number of senior-focused primary care centers is likely to boost the patient base and fetch higher revenues to the CenterWell segment.The intensified focus of Humana in opening successive senior-focused primary care centers seems to be time opportune, considering the growing U.S. senior population. Thereby, HUM has a well-established Medicare business in place for effectively catering to the diversified health needs of the aging population. Contract wins and renewals from federal and state authorities or fulfillment of expansion plans are likely to expand Medicare membership growth and nationwide footprint for the health insurer. Story continuesCenterWell Senior Primary Care and Conviva Care Center brands form a part of the Primary Care Organization of Humana, which is one of the largest senior-focused primary care providers in the United States. The brands together offer senior-focused primary care services through more than 250 centers across 12 states and aims to inaugurate 30-50 centers each year through 2025.Shares of Humana have dipped 0.1% in a year, compared with the industry’s 3% decline.

Prior to this, only those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, requiring strict insulin therapy, were eligible for FreeStyle Libre 2.The latest development, while advancing Abbott’s Diabetes Care business line, facilitates broader access to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.More on ReimbursementFrance is the first nation in Europe to extend national coverage of Abbott's industry-redefining FreeStyle Libre technology to diabetics who take basal insulin. This comes after similar increases in reimbursement coverage for its technology in Japan and the Medicare programme in the United States. This adds an additional 3 million people with diabetes who are qualified to use FreeStyle Libre technology to control their disease.Based on research demonstrating the clinical advantages of utilizing the FreeStyle Libre system among all insulin users, the French reimbursement expansion was approved. According to the Real-World Evidence of FreeStyle Libre (RELIEF) study, a retrospective analysis of the French national claims database, people with Type 2 diabetes using once-daily (basal) insulin significantly reduced their risk of developing acute complications from diabetes. This resulted in a 67% decline in hospitalisations.Significance of Extended ReimbursementIt is worth mentioning that in France, Type 2 diabetes affects more than 90% of diabetics and can cause major issues affecting the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and neurological system if not treated properly. The increased reimbursement makes it possible for more people in France who have diabetes to use the most recent CGM technology, which can help them make wise decisions about their health and way of life.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesThe decision to implement national reimbursement in France is a significant step towards granting persons with diabetes greater access. The benefits of continuous glucose monitoring, which were previously only available to those with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and who were undergoing extensive insulin therapy, are now accessible to a broader population of patients thanks to Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2's increased reimbursement.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global diabetes devices market size was valued at $26.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% by 2030.The increasing adoption of insulin delivery devices and rising prevalence of diabetes are supporting market growth. Leading manufacturers are focusing on technological innovations and the development of advanced products to gain a substantial share of the market.Progress Within Diabetes BusinessIn April 2023, Abbott announced thar using its FreeStyle Libre portfolio, the most widely used and reasonably priced continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) in the United States, more Medicare beneficiaries, who are living with diabetes and using insulin, would be eligible for coverage.  A FreeStyle CGM can now be covered by Medicare for diabetics with problematic hypoglycemia, a condition where a person's blood glucose is lower than normal and can cause fainting or unconsciousness.The same month, Abbott announced that the FDA has approved a reader for its FreeStyle Libre 3 integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system, which features the world's smallest, thinnest and most discreet glucose sensor. The FreeStyle Libre 3 reader is a small handheld device that displays real-time glucose readings directly from a small sensor worn on the back of a person's upper arm, allowing them to manage their diabetes quickly and easily by viewing their glucose readings on a large, bright and easy-to-see screen.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 0.8% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 22.3%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its strong diagnostic business are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to data security threats and overdependence on diagnostic tests persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 14.3% compared with a 23.5% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 11.9% growth in the said time frame.The renowned rapid diagnostic testing solutions provider has a market capitalization of $5.70 billion. QuidelOrtho projects 7.9% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 55%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Diagnostic Business Grows Well: We are upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s focus on advancing its diagnostics business to improve human health, which has enabled the company to target market segments that represent significant total market opportunities. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the company remains focused on its three near-term growth drivers — the VITROS System in the Labs business, the Sofia platform within the Point-of-Care business and the Savanna Molecular platform in the Molecular Diagnostics business.Product Innovation Aids Growth: We are optimistic about QuidelOrtho’s progress with its products over the past few months. On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that the company has 20-25 new and refreshed assays planned for launch by the end of 2024.Over the past few months, QuidelOrtho has been making progress on the regulatory front for its products. On the earnings call, management stated that QuidelOrtho’s Savanna Molecular platform is currently available throughout Europe. The company has plans to commercialize it worldwide upon receiving additional regulatory clearances.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: QuidelOrtho’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust revenues from its Labs segment and China region. The company also registered solid revenues from its Instrument revenue category. QuidelOrtho also saw an uptick in its Vitros System’s integrated installed base and Sofia Platform’s cumulative installed base in the quarter.DownsidesData Security Threats: QuidelOrtho utilizes complex information technology systems to transmit and store information, including proprietary information, to support its business and process. In future, these systems may prove inadequate to its business needs and necessary upgrades may not operate as designed, resulting in high costs or disruptions in portions of the company’s business.Overdependence on Diagnostic Tests: A significant percentage of QuidelOrtho’s revenues comes from the sale of COVID-19 and influenza tests and these are expected to remain a significant portion of the company’s total revenues for at least in the near future. As a result, if sales or revenues of COVID-19 or influenza tests fall for any reason, the company’s operating results will be affected.Estimate TrendQuidelOrtho is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.3% north to $5.26.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $618.2 million, suggesting a 0.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

However, strong competitors in the large medical device market pose a tough challenge for Boston Scientific. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 46% against the industry’s 20.7% decline.Boston Scientific ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, the United States grew 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140-basis point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business unit. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) grew 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing in double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth was driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.The company remains excited about the rest of the year and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. During the first quarter, the company received health sciences authority approval for FARAPULSE in Singapore. In Japan, first-quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon. China also grew in double digits in the first quarter, ahead of the company’s expectations, on solid procedural demand as hospitals worked through COVID-delayed procedures.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStory continuesThe raised 2023 guidance seems bullish, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wide trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.On the flip side, continued foreign exchange headwinds largely offset Boston Scientific’s top-line performance. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s reported revenue growth reflected a $88 million headwind from foreign exchange with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. On an operational basis, the company’s revenues witnessed a 290-basis point headwind from foreign exchange.Further, Boston Scientific incurred significant cost pressure. There was an 8.9% rise in the cost of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.6%, while research and development expenses rose 5.6%. Considering the industry-wide trend, Boston Scientific continues to expect 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds.Meanwhile, the presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and Penumbra PEN.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 5.1% for fiscal 2024.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Boston Scientific (BSX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to BSX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Boston Scientific's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Boston Scientific's main business drivers.Headquartered in Natick, MA and founded in 1979, Boston Scientific Corporation manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. The company has adopted the organic as well as inorganic routes for success.In 2022, Boston Scientific has reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses, each of which generates revenues from the sale of Medical Devices, into two reportable segments, MedSurg (38.5% of total revenue; 2022 organic growth was 7.7% over 2021) and Cardiovascular (accounting for the rest; 10.1% organic growth in 2022).Within the Cardiovascular segment, the newly formed Cardiology division represents the combined former Rhythm Management and Interventional Cardiology businesses.MedSurg group comprises 3 sub segments, viz. Endoscopy; Urology and Pelvic Health; and Neuromodulation.The company is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. Boston Scientific markets a broad portfolio of internally-developed and self-manufactured drug eluting stents including the Promus PREMIER, Promus Element and Promus Element Plus everolimus-eluting stents. In addition, in Europe, it markets the SYNERGY Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating.Story continuesThe company also markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Boston Scientific a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $5,978.12, or a gain of 497.81%, as of June 23, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 175.17% and gold's return of 36.08% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for BSX.Boston Scientific's first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate by decent margins.  The company registered a strong improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter. The increased 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. Over the past year, Boston Scientific outperformed its industry. On the flip side, mounting costs are putting pressure on the bottom line. Continued FX headwinds largely offset the company’s top line performance.The stock has jumped 6.01% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 12 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Bernstein upgraded K shares to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $62 per share.The company posted strong results in its latest release, exceeding our consensus EPS estimate by 10% and delivering a positive 2.4% revenue surprise.

All six patients treated with VX-880 had undetectable fasting C-peptide (endogenous insulin secretion) at baseline, a history of recurrent SHEs in the year prior to treatment and required an average of 34.0 units of insulin per day. Following treatment, all six patients demonstrated endogenous insulin secretion, improved glycemic control as measured by HbA1c, improved time-in-range on continuous glucose monitoring, and reduction or elimination of exogenous insulin use. Patients with greater than 90 days of follow-up had elimination of SHEs in the evaluation period.One patient in Part A received a half-target dose of VX-880 and was followed for approximately nine months, at which time this patient received a second half dose. This patient subsequently withdrew consent (not related to adverse events [AEs]) and was therefore not evaluable for the primary endpoint.Two patients treated with VX-880 had at least 12 months of follow-up after the last infusion and were therefore evaluable for the study’s primary efficacy endpoint of elimination of SHEs between Day 90 and Month 12 with a reduction of HbA1c (&lt;7.0% or a decrease of at least 1% compared to baseline). Both of these patients met the criteria for the primary endpoint of the study. In addition, these two patients are insulin independent. Patient A1 had HbA1c of 5.3% at Month 21, compared to 8.6% at baseline, and Patient B1 had HbA1c of 6.0% at Month 12, compared to 7.6% at baseline. Both patients showed over 95% time-in-range based on continuous glucose monitoring. The ADA recommended target is ≥70%.Story continuesThe three additional patients in Part B, each administered the full target dose of VX-880 given as a single infusion, have follow-up between 29 and 90 days and have shown endogenous insulin secretion, reduction in HbA1c, improvements in glucose time-in-range, and reductions in daily exogenous insulin use. Their trajectory is consistent with that observed in the two patients with more than one year of follow-up at equivalent periods of follow-up after VX-880 infusion.VX-880 has been generally well tolerated in all patients dosed to date. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate, and there were no serious AEs related to VX-880 treatment. The most common AEs were dehydration, diarrhea, hypomagnesemia and rash. As previously reported, one subject had SHEs in the perioperative period.As a result of these safety and efficacy data in Parts A and B, the independent data review committee has recommended moving to Part C of the trial, which allows for concurrent dosing of patients at the full target dose of VX-880.""These data represent a foundational advance in the potential treatment of T1D, bringing us one step closer to a potentially curative therapy for patients who are waiting,"" said Felicia Pagliuca, Ph.D., Disease Area Executive, Type 1 Diabetes at Vertex. ""These data are particularly meaningful in the context of our overall investigational T1D program, as these same VX-880 cells are the building blocks for our Phase 1/2 VX-264 cells-plus-device program, as well as our research-stage hypoimmune islet cell program.""""The reproducible efficacy across multiple patients and endpoints, including the level of glucose control and the elimination of SHEs, observed in this trial is highly unusual in T1D patients treated with exogenous insulin, wherein only ~25% of people with T1D meet the recommended HbA1c target of 7.0%, and is truly remarkable,"" said Trevor Reichman, M.D., Department of Surgery, University of Toronto. ""The normalization of HbA1c without the need for exogenous insulin one year after therapy with VX-880 is historic and offers hope that the transformative therapies the T1D community has been waiting for may finally become reality.""These data were presented during the American Diabetes Association 83rd Scientific Sessions Conference on June 23, 2023 in San Diego, California at 3:50 p.m. PT as an oral presentation, ""Glucose-Dependent Insulin Production and Insulin-Independence in Type 1 Diabetes from Stem Cell-Derived, Fully Differentiated Islet Cells: Updated Data from the VX-880 Clinical Trial"" (abstract/publication #836-P), as part of the ""Designer Beta Cells"" symposium from 3:45 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. PT. These data will be shared as a poster on Sunday, June 25 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PT.About Vertex T1D Programs in Clinical DevelopmentAbout VX-880VX-880 is an investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell therapy manufactured using proprietary technology. VX-880 is being evaluated for patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. VX-880 has the potential to restore the body’s ability to regulate glucose levels by restoring pancreatic islet cell function, including glucose responsive insulin production. VX-880 is delivered by an infusion into the hepatic portal vein and requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy to protect the islet cells from immune rejection.The VX-880 trial has expanded to additional sites that are active and enrolling in Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands.VX-880 was recently granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency in March 2023, in addition to Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA in March 2021. PRIME designation is granted to innovative new therapies that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need.About the VX-880 Phase 1/2 Clinical TrialThe clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. This study is designed as a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-880. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the clinical trial. Enrollment is ongoing in this study.About VX-264VX-264 is an investigational cell therapy in which allogeneic human stem cell-derived islets are encapsulated in a channel array device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system. VX-264 is designed to be surgically implanted and is currently being evaluated for patients with T1D.About the VX-264 Phase 1/2 Clinical TrialThe clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D. This will be a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the global clinical trial. Enrollment is ongoing in this study.About Type 1 DiabetesT1D results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas, leading to loss of insulin production and impairment of blood glucose control. The absence of insulin leads to abnormalities in how the body processes nutrients, leading to high blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and, over time, to complications such as kidney disease/failure, eye disease (including vision loss), heart disease, stroke, nerve damage and even death.Due to the limitations and complexities of insulin delivery systems, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain balance in glucose control in people with T1D. Current standards of care do not address the underlying causes of the disease, and there are limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D; there is currently no cure for diabetes.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF.

244,5c3e77f1-c111-333c-9307-d7c9e187bf64,NSC,2023-06-24,20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-infrastructure-companies-us-202056005.html,1687551656,STORY,"['AMT', 'FLR', 'PAA', 'SRE', 'PARR', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'KMI', 'CCI']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S.For a country to develop and improve its standard of living, improved infrastructure is not just essential but integral to said development. Reliable infrastructure allows for supply chains to link up and efficiently move goods and services across various locations. Households are connected to major metropolitan areas where greater job opportunities are present and thus, allow for an increasing pool of talent, decreasing unemployment. Similarly, broadband services allow for greater remote connections than ever before, and in a world where remote working is becoming more and more common, can also directly result in higher employment and better standards of living even in remote areas. This is why many developing economies attempt to spend heavily on infrastructure and companies, while the poorest countries in the world are known for their lack of proper infrastructure.20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the USIn the U.S., the debate on railroads, which are a crucial part of the country's economic stability, raged in late 2022 when railroad workers threatened a strike, and the shutdown would have cost billions of dollars in damage at the very minimum to the nation's economy, which was already battling an impending recession because of high inflation and hiking of interest rates. Even though the top railroads in the country, some of which are also among the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., earned soaring profits in 2022, none of this was transmitted to the labor, the backbone of the industry. The railroad workers demanded better pay, improved working conditions and paid time off. Generally, the government can't do much to stop protests and strikes under expression of free speech, but the railroad industry works a little differently. Because of an almost century old arcane law that governs only airlines and railroads, what should have been an economic issue became a political one, and allowed the government to intervene.Story continuesBecause of The Railway Labor Act, the House committee was able to impose the same contract terms on railroad workers that they had firmly rejected, and this was swiftly followed by confirmation in the Senate. After that, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the measure in December 2022, and thus, the possibility of a strike was averted even though railroad workers were not happy with the package they were getting. The strike would have resulted in almost 30% of the country's freight shipments coming to a halt, and would likely have directly increased inflation. While the end result was excellent for some of the largest infrastructure companies in the U.S. and shareholders, the news was not good for those forced to work for these companies in such conditions.According to UBS, infrastructure industry performance in 2022 remained stable even as global economic turmoil continued to rise. The main aim of the infrastructure industry, and the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., is to continue increased focus on digitization and decarbonization, two of the most important cornerstones in terms of assessing a company's outlook and growth potential as financials alone are no longer sufficient to determine whether a company is a good option for investment. While most infrastructure companies have maintained stability, those engaged in the oil and gas sector have deliver robust growth as energy prices sky-rocketed as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, this growth does not seem to very sustainable as oil prices have already dropped significantly from their peak and commodities are expected to be moderate in both 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, private infrastructure companies are in the spotlight currently as they have demonstrated resilience even in a turbulent market and have been considered great opportunities for investment right now.Summarizing their results in 2022 and outlook for 2022, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), one of the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings transcript ""However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to slide eight. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment.""The biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. have combined revenues in excess of $520 billion annually, while their market cap exceeds $862 billion. To finalize our list, we consulted companies from Engineering News Record Top 100 list and from Fortune 500. For companies which were listed, their trailing twelve month revenue (TTM) and latest market cap was taken from Yahoo Finance and were ranked based on their average ranking for the two criteria. For companies which weren't listed, we obtained revenue figures from either their own website or from Forbes, and their ranking was based solely on their revenue.

To see more of these countries, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Payroll Companies in the US.In a rapidly transforming economy, many businesses are finding it difficult to allocate too many resources to in-house human resources departments. Small and medium-sized businesses may be the most troubled by their growing human resources needs, resulting in a demand for companies that can provide human capital management and human resources-related services to bridge the gap between the requirements of these companies and their means. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles on the payroll service-providing space, this demand has resulted in the creation of payroll companies that help alleviate part of the burden these businesses are straining under, resulting in the payroll industry itself now being worth billions of dollars.Companies operating within this industry, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), have been making the most of the opportunity that has been presented to them as more and more businesses today are beginning to seek external payroll providers. Outsourcing payroll-related services can offer many benefits to these businesses, especially those that are trying to grow, as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) itself explains in an article on its website. The company claims that by outsourcing payroll, businesses can save time, minimize payroll-related errors, improve their security, maintain compliance, reduce costs, and facilitate employee self-service, among more.How Payroll Companies Can Support BusinessesApart from the obvious service payroll companies provide, which is their help in paying employees, most of these companies also offer a range of other services that can help run businesses efficiently while driving up their productivity. These companies often aid businesses with onboarding and recruitment processes, alongside providing employee benefits, such as health insurance and much more. By taking human capital management into their own hands, payroll companies can take away a large chunk of the pressure small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, may be under.Story continuesThe market for these companies has always been large, as a report by Allied Market Research shows. It mentions that the global payroll outsourcing market was worth about $9.9 billion in 2021. This figure was projected to grow to $19.5 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% between 2022 and 2031. The report also mentions that the payroll industry was positively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to further growth. Since organizations had to shift to working online during the pandemic, human resources and payroll managers found it increasingly difficult to meet their goals, leaving the path open for payroll companies to offer their cloud-based services.The report also elaborates further on how small businesses, in particular, can benefit immensely by outsourcing their payroll operations. By turning to companies that are dedicated to handling payroll and other related services, small businesses can free up time for themselves to focus on their core business. Additionally, since many payroll companies provide a centralized database for payroll and attendance information, businesses can use the information they receive to develop strategies that can help them increase the productivity of their employees.As the payroll industry continues to grow, the method of manually recording employee details and sending out their payments is steadily becoming outdated. Most businesses today are opting for third-party payroll service providers in the interest of saving time and driving up productivity. This environment is thus enabling the rapid growth of the payroll industry, leading us to compile a list of the biggest payroll companies operating in the US today, so stakeholders can identify key players in this market.16 Biggest Payroll Companies in the USOur MethodologyWe selected some of the biggest payroll companies in the US for our list below.

246,5c3e77f1-c111-333c-9307-d7c9e187bf64,SRE,2023-06-24,20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-infrastructure-companies-us-202056005.html,1687551656,STORY,"['AMT', 'FLR', 'PAA', 'SRE', 'PARR', 'CSX', 'NSC', 'KMI', 'CCI']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S.For a country to develop and improve its standard of living, improved infrastructure is not just essential but integral to said development. Reliable infrastructure allows for supply chains to link up and efficiently move goods and services across various locations. Households are connected to major metropolitan areas where greater job opportunities are present and thus, allow for an increasing pool of talent, decreasing unemployment. Similarly, broadband services allow for greater remote connections than ever before, and in a world where remote working is becoming more and more common, can also directly result in higher employment and better standards of living even in remote areas. This is why many developing economies attempt to spend heavily on infrastructure and companies, while the poorest countries in the world are known for their lack of proper infrastructure.20 Biggest Infrastructure Companies in the USIn the U.S., the debate on railroads, which are a crucial part of the country's economic stability, raged in late 2022 when railroad workers threatened a strike, and the shutdown would have cost billions of dollars in damage at the very minimum to the nation's economy, which was already battling an impending recession because of high inflation and hiking of interest rates. Even though the top railroads in the country, some of which are also among the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., earned soaring profits in 2022, none of this was transmitted to the labor, the backbone of the industry. The railroad workers demanded better pay, improved working conditions and paid time off. Generally, the government can't do much to stop protests and strikes under expression of free speech, but the railroad industry works a little differently. Because of an almost century old arcane law that governs only airlines and railroads, what should have been an economic issue became a political one, and allowed the government to intervene.Story continuesBecause of The Railway Labor Act, the House committee was able to impose the same contract terms on railroad workers that they had firmly rejected, and this was swiftly followed by confirmation in the Senate. After that, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the measure in December 2022, and thus, the possibility of a strike was averted even though railroad workers were not happy with the package they were getting. The strike would have resulted in almost 30% of the country's freight shipments coming to a halt, and would likely have directly increased inflation. While the end result was excellent for some of the largest infrastructure companies in the U.S. and shareholders, the news was not good for those forced to work for these companies in such conditions.According to UBS, infrastructure industry performance in 2022 remained stable even as global economic turmoil continued to rise. The main aim of the infrastructure industry, and the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., is to continue increased focus on digitization and decarbonization, two of the most important cornerstones in terms of assessing a company's outlook and growth potential as financials alone are no longer sufficient to determine whether a company is a good option for investment. While most infrastructure companies have maintained stability, those engaged in the oil and gas sector have deliver robust growth as energy prices sky-rocketed as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, this growth does not seem to very sustainable as oil prices have already dropped significantly from their peak and commodities are expected to be moderate in both 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, private infrastructure companies are in the spotlight currently as they have demonstrated resilience even in a turbulent market and have been considered great opportunities for investment right now.Summarizing their results in 2022 and outlook for 2022, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), one of the biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S., mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings transcript ""However, we remain optimistic that we will be Industrial production with our strong focus on business development. So now moving on to slide eight. Here is our market outlook for 2023 as we sit here today. Starting with our Bulk commodities, we expect a challenging year were grain based on drought conditions, which will affect crop availability in UP served origin. However, we expect to see growth in coal, even though natural gas prices have come off their highs, low inventories will continue -- will support continued demand. We are keeping a close eye on natural gas prices, given the price impact of our index based contracts. In addition, we expect biofuel shipments for renewable diesel to continue to grow due to solid market demand, new production facilities coming online and business development wins. Moving on to Industrial. The forecast for Industrial production is to shrink slightly in 2023 and the demand is softening in forest products. However, we expect to see continued strength in metal with new business wins. And lastly, for Premium, we expect the entire Intermodal market to be challenged, both international and domestic by high inventory levels, lower truck rates and temper consumer spending. We expect to outperform that market, however, through our new business with Schneider, as well as opportunities to grow with other private asset owners and our strong IMC partners. We expect automotive growth to be another bright spot in this segment driven by production strength and inventory replenishment.""The biggest infrastructure companies in the U.S. have combined revenues in excess of $520 billion annually, while their market cap exceeds $862 billion. To finalize our list, we consulted companies from Engineering News Record Top 100 list and from Fortune 500. For companies which were listed, their trailing twelve month revenue (TTM) and latest market cap was taken from Yahoo Finance and were ranked based on their average ranking for the two criteria.

With the ongoing economic expansion, insurers remain well-poised for growth. However, catastrophe losses might have weighed on P&amp;C insurers.The industry has risen 16.4% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s growth of 11.4% and the Finance sector’s 3.7% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF and Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE.Cincinnati Financial, with a market capitalization of $15.4 billion, provides property casualty insurance products in the United States. Everest Re, with a market capitalization of $15.3 billion, provides reinsurance and insurance products in the United States, Bermuda and internationally. RE also offers commercial P&amp;C insurance products. CINF and RE carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improvement in pricing drives premiums and claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premiums are estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023, while non-life premiums are expected to rise 2.2%.Price hikes, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal and the appointment of retail agents should help write higher premiums.The insurance industry remains exposed to catastrophe loss stemming from natural disasters, which drag down underwriting profit. Colorado State University predicted a near-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2023 with 15 named storms. These include seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.For 2022, Aon had estimated a global economic loss of $313 billion from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be more than $130 billion. Per a report published in Insurance Journal, net underwriting loss increased seven-fold to $26.9 billion in 2022. Per Verisk and APCIA, the combined ratio deteriorated 310 basis points year over year to 102.7% in 2022.Exposure growth, improved pricing, prudent underwriting, favorable reserve development and a sturdy capital position will help to absorb catastrophe losses. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.With three rate hikes in 2023, investment income should improve further, as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. As of now, Fed has held back the hiking cycle after 10 straight increases but expects two more rate hikes in future. An improving rate environment is favorable for long-tail insurers. Also, investment income is an important component of an insurer’s top line.Consolidation in the P&amp;C insurance industry is expected to continue, as insurers look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition activities to ramp up growth, and aid these insurers in engaging in shareholder-friendly moves.Insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade policy administration and claims systems and expand automation capabilities across their organizations.Let's delve deeper into specific parameters to ascertain which P&amp;C insurer is better positioned at the moment.Story continuesPrice PerformanceEverest Re has gained 29.9% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 16.4%. Cincinnati Financial shares have declined 14.2% in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReturn on Equity (ROE)Everest Re, with a ROE of 12.9%, exceeds Cincinnati Financial’s ROE of 5.4% and the industry average of 6.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationThe price-to-book value is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with Everest Re’s P/B ratio of 1.73, Cincinnati Financial is cheaper, with a reading of 1.43. The P&amp;C insurance industry’s P/B ratio is 1.43.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividend YieldCincinnati Financial’s dividend yield of 3% is better than the Everest Re’s dividend yield of 1.8%. Thus, Cincinnati Financial has an advantage over Everest Re on this front.Debt-to-CapitalRE’s debt-to-capital ratio of 25.5 is higher than the industry average of 19.7 and CINF’s reading of 7.69.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings Surprise HistoryCincinnati Financial has a solid record of beating earnings estimates in five of the last seven quarters, missing twice. Everest Re beat earnings estimates in three of the last seven quarters and missed on four occasions.Hence, CINF has an edge in this regard over RE.Growth ProjectionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings indicates 62.2% growth from the year-ago reported figure for Everest Re, while the same for Cincinnati Financial indicates an increase of 7.7%.VGM ScoreVGM Score rates each stock on its combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and most promising momentum. Everest Re has a VGM Score of A, while Cincinnati Financial has a VGM Score of D. Thus, Everest Re is better placed.Earnings EstimatesFor 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CINF has moved 0.4% north to $4.57 in the past 60 days, while the same for RE has been revised 0.8% downward to $43.92. Therefore, CINF is in an advantageous position over RE on this front.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis shows that Cincinnati Financial is better positioned than Everest Re with respect to dividend yield, valuation, leverage, earnings surprise history and earnings estimates.

251,d082785b-ef9f-3057-86f3-d6039a554986,UNH,2023-06-24,10 Annuity Companies To Avoid,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-annuity-companies-avoid-234157601.html,1687563717,STORY,"['UNH', 'MKL', 'MET']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 annuity companies to avoid if you are looking for companies with minimal risk. To see more of these companies, you can go directly to see the 5 Annuity Companies To Avoid.In one of our previous articles, we explained how annuities are considered to be a more specialized concept within the insurance industry. To briefly recap, annuities are a form of insurance that take the shape of contracts between insurance companies and their clients, with the requirement being placed on the insurer to make payments to their customers. These payments may be made either immediately or at some point in the future, based on the type of annuity you get. As far as the customer is concerned, they can purchase an annuity through either a single, one-time payment or by making a series of payments that are spread out over several years. As we mentioned before, the four main types of annuities include immediate annuities, deferred annuities, fixed annuities, and variable annuities. This form of insurance, and the companies that offer them to their clients, will be the subject of our article today, with a specific focus on which companies should be avoided within this space, considering their financial health.Global Insurance In A BindThe insurance industry at large is considered to be one that has been suffering from widespread instability over the past few years. Due to this, insurance companies such as Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) are having to face grown challenges induced by digital changes, rising concerns surrounding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, and more. According to a McKinsey report on the insurance industry, published in November 2022, the industry has been suffering in terms of its performance and relevance. One major indicator of this is that nominal GDP growth seems to have outpaced premium growth. The report mentioned that in the US and Europe, while nominal GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4% over the 20 years preceding 2022, premium growth grew by a compound annual growth rate of merely 2% over the same period. Similar trends have been noted in Asia as well.Story continuesThe report also mentions that the insurance industry struggled to generate returns in excess of the cost of capital over the same period of 20 years. Additionally, the situation shows that insurance carriers have been unable to structurally address their cost base. This has resulted in the insurance industry lagging behind others, such as the asset management industry, which has managed to address its costs and mitigate their impact on its revenues. According to McKinsey, this has resulted in the insurance industry's costs as a share of revenues increasing by 23% since 2003. Several other observations in the report seem to paint a bleak picture regarding the performance of the insurance industry thus far.Optimism From Other AvenuesDespite the above, other financial organizations such as A.M. Best have been highlighting the fact that the insurance industry, and within it, the specialized segment of annuities, may, in fact, be set for a stable journey in 2023. The organization's market segment report published in November 2022 showed that it was maintaining its Stable outlook for the US life/annuity segment, the US health insurance industry, the global reinsurance segment, and the US commercial lines segment. A.M. Best also maintained a Positive outlook for the delegated underwriting authority enterprises market.This outlook on different segments within the insurance industry highlights that all may not be lost for the industry. It is based on many factors. These include record annuity sales growth of 22% in the US in the second quarter of 2022, improvements in global reinsurance rates compared to their state in 2018, sustained strong underwriting performance during the COVID-19 pandemic and economic volatility, and rising cyber-focused investments during 2022 driving the ability of delegated underwriting authority enterprises to capitalize on their expertise and advanced tech to strengthen their distribution channels. On this last factor, it is to be noted that the report quoted a figure of nearly $1 billion being poured into cyber-focused investments between January and November 2022.The above factors combined paint a picture that implies that while the insurance industry is certainly not breezing through its difficulties, there remains hope for this sector just yet. However, safety and caution must be exercised when venturing into this space. In light of this, we have compiled a list of annuity companies, in particular, to avoid if you are a customer looking for a company with immense financial health.10 Annuity Companies To Avoidaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashOur MethodologyTo select the annuity companies for our list, we used the Life Insurer Financial Report published in 2022 to pick out companies with A.M. Best ratings of B++ and below and Comdex scores of under 50. A.M. Best ratings include A++ (Superior), A+ (Superior), A (Excellent), A- (Excellent), B++ (Very Good), B+ (Good), B, B-, C++, C+, C, C-, D (all Vulnerable), E (Under State Supervision), F (In Liquidation), and S (Rating Suspended). These ratings highlight the financial strength of the company, with ratings of B++ and below indicating that the company's financial strength falls short, especially in comparison to its competitors.The Comdex Score is a ranking from 1-100 and represents a composite score of all ratings assigned by rating agencies. A Comdex score of 49 would mean that the company in question is ranked higher than 48% of all insurance companies. The higher a company's Comdex score, the better it is considered to be. We have thus ranked these companies based on their A.M. Best ratings and Comdex scores, from the highest to the lowest in both metrics.Annuity Companies To Avoid10. CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance CompanyAM Best Rating: B++Comdex Score: 49CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company is a company that was founded in 1978. It falls under the wing of Crestline Assurance Holdings LLC. The company is based in Fort Worth, Texas.CL Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company offers flexible retirement solutions and high-value retirement savings tools. It provides clients with single premium tax-deferred annuities with interest rates over a time frame of one to five years, among more. While this company's A.M. Best rating of B++ and Comdex score of 49 show that it's doing alright financially, for those looking to have an ironclad annuity and insurance provider, this company may not be the right pick.Metlife, Inc.

To see more of these countries, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Payroll Companies in the US.In a rapidly transforming economy, many businesses are finding it difficult to allocate too many resources to in-house human resources departments. Small and medium-sized businesses may be the most troubled by their growing human resources needs, resulting in a demand for companies that can provide human capital management and human resources-related services to bridge the gap between the requirements of these companies and their means. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles on the payroll service-providing space, this demand has resulted in the creation of payroll companies that help alleviate part of the burden these businesses are straining under, resulting in the payroll industry itself now being worth billions of dollars.Companies operating within this industry, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), have been making the most of the opportunity that has been presented to them as more and more businesses today are beginning to seek external payroll providers. Outsourcing payroll-related services can offer many benefits to these businesses, especially those that are trying to grow, as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) itself explains in an article on its website. The company claims that by outsourcing payroll, businesses can save time, minimize payroll-related errors, improve their security, maintain compliance, reduce costs, and facilitate employee self-service, among more.How Payroll Companies Can Support BusinessesApart from the obvious service payroll companies provide, which is their help in paying employees, most of these companies also offer a range of other services that can help run businesses efficiently while driving up their productivity. These companies often aid businesses with onboarding and recruitment processes, alongside providing employee benefits, such as health insurance and much more. By taking human capital management into their own hands, payroll companies can take away a large chunk of the pressure small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, may be under.Story continuesThe market for these companies has always been large, as a report by Allied Market Research shows. It mentions that the global payroll outsourcing market was worth about $9.9 billion in 2021. This figure was projected to grow to $19.5 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% between 2022 and 2031. The report also mentions that the payroll industry was positively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to further growth. Since organizations had to shift to working online during the pandemic, human resources and payroll managers found it increasingly difficult to meet their goals, leaving the path open for payroll companies to offer their cloud-based services.The report also elaborates further on how small businesses, in particular, can benefit immensely by outsourcing their payroll operations. By turning to companies that are dedicated to handling payroll and other related services, small businesses can free up time for themselves to focus on their core business. Additionally, since many payroll companies provide a centralized database for payroll and attendance information, businesses can use the information they receive to develop strategies that can help them increase the productivity of their employees.As the payroll industry continues to grow, the method of manually recording employee details and sending out their payments is steadily becoming outdated. Most businesses today are opting for third-party payroll service providers in the interest of saving time and driving up productivity. This environment is thus enabling the rapid growth of the payroll industry, leading us to compile a list of the biggest payroll companies operating in the US today, so stakeholders can identify key players in this market.16 Biggest Payroll Companies in the USOur MethodologyWe selected some of the biggest payroll companies in the US for our list below.

257,bd79a3a6-7ac5-3df1-8c79-90e0e9140bd9,PG,2023-06-24,Graphic Package Holding and Vornado Realty have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-package-holding-vornado-realty-121600234.html,1687522560,STORY,"['VNO', 'PG', 'WMT', 'GPK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 23, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Graphic Package Holding Co. GPK as the Bull of the Day and Vornado Realty Trust VNO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart WMT, McDonald’s MCD and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Graphic Package Holding Co. is a prominent and dynamic multinational corporation that specializes in providing innovative packaging solutions to various industries. With a strong global presence and a history dating back several decades, GPK has established itself as a leader in the packaging industry.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a historically cheap valuation, strong earnings growth and expanding operations, Graphic Packaging Holding Company is a worthy consideration for any investment portfolio.Industry Leading ProductsThe company's comprehensive portfolio encompasses a wide range of packaging products, including corrugated containers, folding cartons, displays, and labels. GPK has been capitalizing on the newest trends in consumer packaging and is producing some of the highest quality renewable and recyclable, fiber-based packaging in the industry.At its most recent quarterly earnings meeting, management announced that Chick-Fil-A, the most profitable fast-food chain in the US, would be launching GPK’s new, highly insulated, double-wall fiber-based cups as a potential long-term solution for their beverage program.Steady Stock PerformanceGraphic Package Holding Company has been an extremely steady and impressive performing stock. Over the last decade GPK has compounded at 14% annually, beating both the broad market and industry. Additionally, GPK offers a tidy 1.6% dividend yield, which has increased 10% annually over the last three years.Earnings TrendGPK has experienced consistent revisions higher in its earnings estimates since 2021, following the steady pace of returns in the stock. The last two months have seen especially strong earnings revisions giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesCurrent quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 7% over the last two months and are projected to grow 28% YoY. Additionally, FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 10.2% and are expected to climb 30% YoY.Considering sales are expected to grow 6% YoY in the current quarter and FY23, and earnings are expected to grow multiples of that, GPK is clearly improving business efficiency. The company’s CEO Michael Doss recently noted that “during the (most recent) quarter our newest coated recycled paperboard machine in Kalamazoo exceeded quality, yield and financial expectations,” indicating those upgraded efficiencies.Reasonable ValuationGraphic Packaging Holding Company is currently trading at a 10-year low in terms of earnings multiples. Its one-year forward earnings multiple is just 8x, which is well below the market average of 20x, below the industry average of 13x, and its 10-year median of 16.5x.Bottom LineWhile packaging materials may not be quite as sexy as AI or Crypto, Graphic Package Holding Company is making its investors considerable wealth, nonetheless. GPK has an impressive performance history and strong projections for earnings growth. With robust earnings estimate revisions and a cheap valuation GPK stock has the wind at its back.Bear of the Day:Vornado Realty Trust, the owner and manager of a considerable portfolio of premium office real estate has been crushed by the shifting commercial real estate market, and explosion of work from home jobs. VNO has endured considerable downgrades to its earnings expectations over the last 18 months giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).CompanyVornado Realty Trust is a leading US real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in commercial properties. Established in 1982, Vornado owns, develops, and manages prime office buildings, retail centers, and residential properties in major markets such as New York City and Washington, DC. The company focuses on strategic investments, value creation through renovations and repositioning. Vornado is also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and is the largest owner of LEED-certified property in the United States, with more than 27 million square feet of LEED-certified properties.Challenged EnvironmentShares in the VNO REIT have suffered over the last five years, down -72% over that time. This is significantly worse than the industry average and broad market. Vornado has a high concentration of buildings in metropolitan areas that have changed dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic.While office buildings in NYC were once thought of as premier assets, they have been completely upended by the transition to work from home. While top of the market assets, like those owned by Vornado have held up a bit better than the rest of the market, Manhattan landlords are still struggling to fill their properties. Q1 office vacancy in Manhattan was estimated at 16% and analysts expect more distress in the sector.Earnings EstimatesRecord high vacancies, as well as a high interest rate environment, which strains real estate businesses, does not bode well for VNO’s earnings expectations. Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in downgrading estimates across timeframes.Current quarter earnings have been revised lower by -4.5% over the last two months and are expected to decline -23% YoY. FY23 earnings have been cut by -4.2% and are projected to slide -20% YoY.ValuationBecause of the severe decline VNO’s share prices over the last two years, its valuation is at a 10-year low. Vornado Realty Trust is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6.2x, which is well below the industry average of 14.7x, and below its 10-year median of 18x.ConclusionVornado Realty Trust is under tremendous pressure, and it does not look like things will be getting better anytime soon. While the 9.7% dividend yield may have been the only thing drawing in investors today it may not be worth the risk. Vornado announced a -29% cut in the dividend in January, and in April announced that all dividend payments will be postponed until the end of 2023.Because of the reasons listed above it is recommended that investors steer clear of Vornado Realty Trust.Additional content:3 Low-Beta Stocks Suited Nicely for Risk-Averse InvestorsLow-beta stocks would be great considerations for investors looking to shield themselves against volatility, as they have historically shown to be less affected by broader market fluctuations.To give a quick refresher, beta measures a stock's volatility or systematic risk compared to the overall market.Stocks with a beta of less than 1.0 provide more stability during volatile periods, and the inverse is also true – stocks with a beta of higher than 1.0 are more susceptible to the broader market’s movements.For those seeking a more conservative approach, three low-beta stocks – Walmart, McDonald’s and Procter &amp; Gamble – could all be considered.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, have an established track record of stable growth, and consistently shell out dividends, undoubtedly a strong trio. Let’s take a closer look at each.WalmartWalmart offers a diverse blend of products at reasonable prices, allowing it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The retail titan posted strong results in its latest release, delivering year-over-year global eCommerce growth of 26% and raising its FY24 outlook. Quarterly revenue totaled $152.2 billion, ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.In addition, Walmart’s 21.3% trailing twelve-month ROE is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets.

259,bd79a3a6-7ac5-3df1-8c79-90e0e9140bd9,VNO,2023-06-24,Graphic Package Holding and Vornado Realty have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-package-holding-vornado-realty-121600234.html,1687522560,STORY,"['VNO', 'PG', 'WMT', 'GPK']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 23, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Graphic Package Holding Co. GPK as the Bull of the Day and Vornado Realty Trust VNO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart WMT, McDonald’s MCD and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Graphic Package Holding Co. is a prominent and dynamic multinational corporation that specializes in providing innovative packaging solutions to various industries. With a strong global presence and a history dating back several decades, GPK has established itself as a leader in the packaging industry.With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a historically cheap valuation, strong earnings growth and expanding operations, Graphic Packaging Holding Company is a worthy consideration for any investment portfolio.Industry Leading ProductsThe company's comprehensive portfolio encompasses a wide range of packaging products, including corrugated containers, folding cartons, displays, and labels. GPK has been capitalizing on the newest trends in consumer packaging and is producing some of the highest quality renewable and recyclable, fiber-based packaging in the industry.At its most recent quarterly earnings meeting, management announced that Chick-Fil-A, the most profitable fast-food chain in the US, would be launching GPK’s new, highly insulated, double-wall fiber-based cups as a potential long-term solution for their beverage program.Steady Stock PerformanceGraphic Package Holding Company has been an extremely steady and impressive performing stock. Over the last decade GPK has compounded at 14% annually, beating both the broad market and industry. Additionally, GPK offers a tidy 1.6% dividend yield, which has increased 10% annually over the last three years.Earnings TrendGPK has experienced consistent revisions higher in its earnings estimates since 2021, following the steady pace of returns in the stock. The last two months have seen especially strong earnings revisions giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesCurrent quarter earnings estimates have been upgraded by 7% over the last two months and are projected to grow 28% YoY. Additionally, FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 10.2% and are expected to climb 30% YoY.Considering sales are expected to grow 6% YoY in the current quarter and FY23, and earnings are expected to grow multiples of that, GPK is clearly improving business efficiency. The company’s CEO Michael Doss recently noted that “during the (most recent) quarter our newest coated recycled paperboard machine in Kalamazoo exceeded quality, yield and financial expectations,” indicating those upgraded efficiencies.Reasonable ValuationGraphic Packaging Holding Company is currently trading at a 10-year low in terms of earnings multiples. Its one-year forward earnings multiple is just 8x, which is well below the market average of 20x, below the industry average of 13x, and its 10-year median of 16.5x.Bottom LineWhile packaging materials may not be quite as sexy as AI or Crypto, Graphic Package Holding Company is making its investors considerable wealth, nonetheless. GPK has an impressive performance history and strong projections for earnings growth. With robust earnings estimate revisions and a cheap valuation GPK stock has the wind at its back.Bear of the Day:Vornado Realty Trust, the owner and manager of a considerable portfolio of premium office real estate has been crushed by the shifting commercial real estate market, and explosion of work from home jobs. VNO has endured considerable downgrades to its earnings expectations over the last 18 months giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).CompanyVornado Realty Trust is a leading US real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in commercial properties. Established in 1982, Vornado owns, develops, and manages prime office buildings, retail centers, and residential properties in major markets such as New York City and Washington, DC. The company focuses on strategic investments, value creation through renovations and repositioning. Vornado is also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and is the largest owner of LEED-certified property in the United States, with more than 27 million square feet of LEED-certified properties.Challenged EnvironmentShares in the VNO REIT have suffered over the last five years, down -72% over that time. This is significantly worse than the industry average and broad market. Vornado has a high concentration of buildings in metropolitan areas that have changed dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic.While office buildings in NYC were once thought of as premier assets, they have been completely upended by the transition to work from home. While top of the market assets, like those owned by Vornado have held up a bit better than the rest of the market, Manhattan landlords are still struggling to fill their properties. Q1 office vacancy in Manhattan was estimated at 16% and analysts expect more distress in the sector.Earnings EstimatesRecord high vacancies, as well as a high interest rate environment, which strains real estate businesses, does not bode well for VNO’s earnings expectations. Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in downgrading estimates across timeframes.Current quarter earnings have been revised lower by -4.5% over the last two months and are expected to decline -23% YoY. FY23 earnings have been cut by -4.2% and are projected to slide -20% YoY.ValuationBecause of the severe decline VNO’s share prices over the last two years, its valuation is at a 10-year low. Vornado Realty Trust is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6.2x, which is well below the industry average of 14.7x, and below its 10-year median of 18x.ConclusionVornado Realty Trust is under tremendous pressure, and it does not look like things will be getting better anytime soon. While the 9.7% dividend yield may have been the only thing drawing in investors today it may not be worth the risk. Vornado announced a -29% cut in the dividend in January, and in April announced that all dividend payments will be postponed until the end of 2023.Because of the reasons listed above it is recommended that investors steer clear of Vornado Realty Trust.Additional content:3 Low-Beta Stocks Suited Nicely for Risk-Averse InvestorsLow-beta stocks would be great considerations for investors looking to shield themselves against volatility, as they have historically shown to be less affected by broader market fluctuations.To give a quick refresher, beta measures a stock's volatility or systematic risk compared to the overall market.Stocks with a beta of less than 1.0 provide more stability during volatile periods, and the inverse is also true – stocks with a beta of higher than 1.0 are more susceptible to the broader market’s movements.For those seeking a more conservative approach, three low-beta stocks – Walmart, McDonald’s and Procter &amp; Gamble – could all be considered.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, have an established track record of stable growth, and consistently shell out dividends, undoubtedly a strong trio. Let’s take a closer look at each.WalmartWalmart offers a diverse blend of products at reasonable prices, allowing it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The retail titan posted strong results in its latest release, delivering year-over-year global eCommerce growth of 26% and raising its FY24 outlook. Quarterly revenue totaled $152.2 billion, ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.In addition, Walmart’s 21.3% trailing twelve-month ROE is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets. As shown below, the current value is well above the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.And to top it off, Walmart is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, putting its shareholder-friendly nature on full display. Shares currently yield 1.5% annually, with the payout growing 2% over the last five years.McDonald’sWe’re all familiar with the restaurant titan McDonald’s, seeing those golden arches at seemingly every stop. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Shares may not entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the Style Score of “D” for Value. MCD shares currently trade at a 26.6X forward earnings multiple, modestly above the five-year median and Zacks sector average.Still, investors haven’t minded forking up the premium for shares given the company’s favorable growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 8% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, estimates call for an additional 9% uptick in earnings and 7% sales growth.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), posted better-than-expected results and provided optimistic guidance in its latest release, helping shares close 3.5% higher post-earnings. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Procter &amp; Gamble is a classic dividend stock, holding the ranks of not only a Dividend Aristocrat but a Dividend King as well. PG shares currently yield 2.5% annually, with the company carrying a solid 6.3% five-year annualized growth rate.In addition, it’s worth noting that shares have recently found support near the $142 per share level, a previous resistance level for the stock.Bottom LineFor those seeking a more conservative approach, low-beta stocks provide precisely that. These stocks are less susceptible to the broader market’s movements, helping to limit those spooky price swings.And all three stocks could be great considerations for those looking for stability.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank and have an established track record of success, undeniably significant benefits.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It's a time to honor those in various stages of their cancer journeys, celebrate those who help patients through their treatments, and raise awareness of the challenges cancer survivors could face after treatment and throughout their lives.In recognition of survivors and those who played a role in their cancer journeys, a group of Aflac employees gathered to handwrite cards and notes of encouragement to cancer survivors, parents and medical staff at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, home to one of the leading childhood cancer survivor programs in the country.""It's important to remember those who have defeated cancer and are living as survivors,"" said Alayne Gamache, program manager, Corporate Social Responsibility. ""They face daily challenges that many people might be unaware of, and the cancer survivor program helps them as they work through these difficulties.""According to the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, 80% of children and young adults diagnosed with cancer will survive, and more than 85% of childhood cancer survivors will experience a significant chronic health condition after treatment that may include physical, psychological and social issues.1 Identifying and treating these problems early can help survivors lead full lives.""With the number of pediatric cancer survivors continuing to grow, the need for improving long-term health and quality of life becomes increasingly important,"" said Dr. Karen Effinger, pediatric oncologist and medical director of the cancer survivor program at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. ""Getting patients into remission is an incredible milestone, but the care doesn't end there - the cancer survivor program gives them the tools they need to thrive and live full lives.""That's why the center offers a multidisciplinary cancer survivor program to address the unique needs of childhood cancer survivors who are at least two years off therapy.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.77% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.65%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.23%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the seller of routers, switches, software and services had gained 4.26% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.75% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.66% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cisco Systems as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.06, up 27.71% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.05 billion, up 14.84% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.81 per share and revenue of $56.84 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.39% and +10.25%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 21.81, which means Cisco Systems is trading at a discount to the group.Investors should also note that CSCO has a PEG ratio of 2.07 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Networking industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.07 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Networking industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 35, which puts it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.
