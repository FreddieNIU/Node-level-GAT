You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth. Investing in dividend stocks is not just about finding companies with a history of paying dividends. It is also important to consider whether those dividends are growing over time. Increasing dividends makes a stock more appealing to people who want to earn regular income from their investments. This combination of consistent payments and growing dividends is a winning strategy for successful dividend stock investing.Although the market has favored tech stocks this year, it appears to be a favorable time to consider investing in dividend stocks as the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated the possibility of increasing interest rates. Here are some comments from the Fed chief at the US central bank’s annual conference on August 25:“Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”High-interest rate periods have historically fared well for dividend stocks. In one of our articles, we referred to Global X data, which revealed that from January 1960 to December 2017, about half of the returns from high-dividend stocks originated from dividends paid during times of elevated interest rates. During this period, portfolios containing high-dividend stocks yielded an average annual return of 13.02%, surpassing the S&amp;P 500's return of 10%. The report also mentioned that in seven out of ten instances when interest rates were rising during this period, high-dividend stocks demonstrated superior performance compared to the broader market.Another important aspect of dividends becomes evident when considering the impact of compounding. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, this compounding effect was examined for the S&amp;P 500 across various timeframes. The data used were averages for each continuous period, based on monthly data spanning 50 years up to June 30, 2021. The results reveal that as the time horizon extends, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, showing a positive correlation between the two factors. For instance, when comparing the annualized difference between the price return and total return of the S&amp;P 500 over each 10-year span, the average difference amounts to almost 78%.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up nearly 50% year-to-date. However, actual earnings for many semiconductor companies have been lackluster at best and often downright terrible.The industry is experiencing a glut in many categories, including GPUs, CPUs, analog and memory chips — among other categories. Still, semiconductor stocks are largely up this year not because of earnings today but rather expectations of what might happen in the future as it relates to chips for artificial intelligence-related (AI) applications.It’s understandable why folks are optimistic, but much of the AI story will take many years to play out. In the meantime, quite a few chip stocks are up sharply despite flat or declining earnings. These three top semiconductor stocks stand out as having strong fundamentals, and their shares are still at attractive prices today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company. And it is by a substantial margin, having a notable share advantage over the #2 player Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI).Analog chips are an attractive field, as they have a slower development cycle than chips that go into fast-moving consumer electronics fields. In recent years, the analog market has grown rapidly thanks to new applications in fields like vehicle electronics, automation and remote monitoring/security.Right now, with the auto market cooling off, TXN stock has slid as well. That’s understandable, as inventories are up across the chip industry. But long-term investors will be richly rewarded; Texas Instrument’s management prioritizes growing free cash flow and returning it to shareholders via both its buyback and generous dividend policy.Intel (INTC)Intel Stock Bores Wall Street and Shareholders Should Be WorriedIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been at the center of the current semiconductor stock storm. Sales of computers have fallen sharply from the boom levels seen early during the pandemic. That makes sense, as the work- and study-from-home trends have now played out, and folks have returned to the office and classroom.Story continuesIntel also faces pressure from its evolution to the next generation of chips. The company also experienced significant technical setbacks in rolling out its next generation of microprocessors.However, sentiment seems much too negative. The computing market will stabilize and return to growth in time. And Intel’s massive R&amp;D budget makes it likely that the company can regain technical parity with its leading rivals.Meanwhile, Intel’s heavy investments in new American manufacturing facilities will give it access to a great deal of funding from the American government, subsidizing such activity. These new plants should modernize Intel’s operations and set it up for another decade of fruitful innovation going forward.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)Flag of the Republic of China or Taiwan on a processor, CPU Central processing Unit or GPU microchip on a motherboard. Taiwan manufacturing chip industry emerges as battlefront in US - China showdown. TSM stockSource: William Potter / Shutterstock.comIntel isn’t the only semiconductor giant cashing in on the CHIPs Act opportunity.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is setting up substantial operations in the United States as well. Given the unsettled state of political affairs between China and Taiwan, that seems like a good insurance policy. And some estimates suggest TSM will secure between $2 billion and $6 billion in government assistance for building its Arizona and Texas plants.TSM will be able to put those plants to good use. The company is the undisputed leader in the chip foundry market, as it earns more than 55% of the entire industry’s revenues. As new chip applications such as AI take off, TSM will see its market grow. Thanks to recession fears and geopolitical worries, the stock is still available at less than 20 times forward earnings.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN and INTC stock.

(BOX), HP Inc. (HPQ) after cutting its full-year earnings forecast, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) after boosting its full-year EPS forecast, and PVH Corp. (PVH) after topping second-quarter earnings estimates.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at a couple of stocks that are trending after-hours. You've got four earnings reports for you. Let's start off with HP. We're looking at a drop of just about 5% here in extended trading. And taking into account the sluggish demand for the PC market, that, of course, is weighing on HP.And you look at the results that we saw here over the last 3 months, the stock performance, I should say, hasn't been too impressive. We're looking at essentially flat over the last 3 months year to date, up just about 16% of the company trimming its full year forecast. That's weighing on shares in after-hours. PC pricing not recovering as quickly as expected.That was executives there chiming in in the earnings release. They did say, though, availability for AI products at the end of next year. They expect that to boost sales here. So a longer term play. Again, HP, though, struggling with a sluggish PC market. And sounds like it could be a challenging couple of months here ahead.Let's flip over to HPE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise software data side of that business now up just about 2 and 1/2% here in extended trading. Now, third quarter net revenue in line with expectations. They did raise their full year profit outlook, though it is not impressing the Street at least for right now in extended trading.Sales of compute unit, which includes the data centers and the services, that was off about 13%, which was weaker than expected. Also, storage sales down about 5%. Their business unit with intelligence edge-- now, this is a really key driving factor here in terms of HPE's turnaround strategy-- sales there up 50%. So we'll see whether or not that momentum can last year to date. We're looking at gains of about 5%.Story continuesBox off about 7% here in extended trading. The company cutting its full year revenue forecast. Billings declining by about 1% on a year-over-year basis. Year to date, the stock off just about 1% over the last year. We're still looking at some gains, up about 15%, although erasing half of that there in extended trading.And rounding it out with retailer PVH. Now, this is the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, also of Calvin Klein. They're out with results here, beating on the top and bottom line. But the third quarter EPS guidance coming in just a bit short. But it looks like the Street is focusing on that beat on the top and bottom line and also its full year profit outlook, which was-- did come in better than expected.We know retailers have been struggling with a pullback here in discretionary spending. But PVH executives in this earnings release saying that they are growing confident in their ability to execute in the back half of the year. Over the last 3 months, the stock up nearly 10%.]"

[NYSE: PVH] today reported its 2023 second quarter results and updated its full year outlook.Stefan Larsson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We delivered another strong quarter across both Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER driven by the disciplined execution of our long-term, brand-building growth plan, the PVH+ Plan. We generated double-digit revenue growth in our direct-to-consumer business in both our stores and in e-commerce, through our relentless focus on building brand desirability through product, consumer engagement and marketplace execution.""Mr. Larsson added, ""We are increasing our EPS outlook for the year, excluding restructuring charges, based on the confidence we have in our ability to execute in the back half of the year, while continuing to successfully navigate the macroeconomic environment. As we lean into the five key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, we’re continuing to gain traction by connecting our consumer-facing execution with an increasingly demand-driven operating engine to fuel long-term profitable growth.""Story continuesZac Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, said, ""We drove another quarter of strong performance, and excluding restructuring charges, have raised our full year EPS outlook, while continuing to project a double-digit EBIT margin, underscoring the conviction we have in our ability to drive improved profitability. In addition, reflecting the confidence that we have in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth, we have increased our share repurchases. We now expect to repurchase up to $400 million of stock in 2023, having repurchased $200 million of stock in just the second quarter. We are well-positioned to achieve strong EPS growth in 2023 and generate significant and increasing cash flow to create value for shareholders.""Non-GAAP Amounts:Amounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are defined or described in greater detail near the end of this release under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions."" Amounts stated on a constant currency basis also are deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented after the Non-GAAP Exclusions section and identify and quantify all excluded items.Second Quarter Review:Revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 2% on a constant currency basis) driven by growth in both the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. The increase included solid performance in the Company’s international businesses, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, including over 20% growth in local currency in China reflecting continued recovery after the lifting of COVID restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2022, and continued growth in Europe in euros. The increase also reflected continued growth in the North America direct-to-consumer business.Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 11% compared to the prior year period (increased 10% on a constant currency basis), with growth in both the Company’s owned and operated stores and owned and operated digital commerce business in all regions.Wholesale revenue decreased 3% compared to the prior year period (decreased 6% on a constant currency basis) as wholesale customers continue to take a cautious approach.Owned and operated digital commerce revenue increased 12% compared to the prior year period (increased 11% on a constant currency basis). The strong growth in the Company’s digital commerce business was more than offset by a decrease in wholesale sales to traditional retailers’ ecommerce businesses and pure players, resulting in a 10% decrease in total digital revenue compared to the prior year period (decreased 12% on a constant currency basis). Total digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 20%.Gross margin was 57.6% compared to 57.2% in the prior year period. The increase reflects benefits from a favorable shift in regional and channel mix, lower freight costs, and price increases, partially offset by higher product costs, including an approximately 120 basis point negative impact on inventory costs due to foreign currency exchange rates.Inventory increased 6% compared to the prior year period. The 6% increase is in line with projected sales growth and reflects a sequential improvement as compared to the 24% year-over-year increase in the first quarter of 2023.Second Quarter Consolidated Results:Revenue increased 4% to $2.207 billion compared to the prior year period (increased 2% on a constant currency basis).Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 6% compared to the prior year period (increased 3% on a constant currency basis).Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 6% (increased 3% on a constant currency basis).Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 4%.Calvin Klein revenue increased 3% compared to the prior year period (increased 2% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein International revenue increased 11% (increased 9% on a constant currency basis).Calvin Klein North America revenue decreased 9% primarily driven by a decrease in the wholesale business.Heritage Brands revenue decreased 11% compared to the prior year period.Earnings before interest and taxes (""EBIT"") on a GAAP basis was $143 million, inclusive of a $5 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $177 million in the prior year period. EBIT on a GAAP basis included costs of $39 million in the current quarter and net costs of $34 million in the prior year period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts.EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $182 million, inclusive of a $5 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $211 million in the prior year period. The revenue increase discussed above was more than offset by (i) the approximately 120 basis point negative impact on inventory costs due to foreign currency exchange rates, discussed above and (ii) overall higher expenses driven by a planned increase in investments to drive the Company’s strategic initiatives, including an increase in marketing, compared to the prior year period. The Company continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives.Earnings per share (""EPS"")GAAP basis: $1.50 compared to $1.72 in the prior year period.Non-GAAP basis: $1.98 compared to $2.08 in the prior year period.EPS on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2023 includes the positive impact of $0.05 per share related to foreign currency translation.EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also included the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excluded these amounts.Interest expense increased to $24 million from $20 million in the prior year period primarily due to higher interest rates.Effective tax rate was 21.3% on a GAAP basis as compared to 26.4% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 21.6% on a non-GAAP basis as compared to 26.9% in the prior year period.Stock Repurchase Program:Delivering on its commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to stockholders, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock for $200 million during the second quarter of 2023.2023 Outlook:Full Year 2023 GuidanceRevenue is projected to increase 3% to 4% as compared to 2022 (increase 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis).EPS on a GAAP basis is projected to be approximately $9.60 compared to $3.03 in 2022. EPS on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring charges, is projected to be approximately $10.35. EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $8.97 in 2022. The 2023 EPS projections on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis include the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.15 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also include the amounts described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis exclude these amounts.Interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $100 million compared to $83 million in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates.Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 22%.Third Quarter 2023 GuidanceRevenue is projected to increase mid-single digits as compared to the third quarter of 2022 (increase low-single digits on a constant currency basis).EPS on a GAAP basis is projected to be approximately $2.43 compared to $(2.88) in the prior year period. EPS on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring charges, is projected to be approximately $2.70. EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $2.60 in the prior year period. The third quarter 2023 EPS projections include the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.15 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also include the amounts described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis exclude these amounts.Interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $25 million compared to $19 million in the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates.Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 22%.Please see the section entitled ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section.Non-GAAP Exclusions:The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude the following:Pre-tax restructuring costs of approximately $60 million incurred and expected to be incurred in 2023 consisting principally of severance related to actions taken in July 2023 and expected to be taken in the third quarter of 2023 under the plans initially announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, of which $39 million was incurred in the second quarter and approximately $21 million is expected to be incurred in the third quarter.Pre-tax gain of $78 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans.Pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates.Pre-tax restructuring costs of $20 million incurred in 2022, consisting principally of severance related to initial actions under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, of which $17 million was incurred in the third quarter and $4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter.Pre-tax net costs of $43 million recorded in 2022 in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its Russia business, primarily consisting of noncash asset impairments and a gain on contract terminations, of which $50 million of charges were recorded in the second quarter and an $8 million gain was recorded in the fourth quarter.Pre-tax gain of $16 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V.Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.The Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and can have a significant impact on the Company’s reported revenues. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period).The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including constant currency revenue information, as a supplement to its GAAP results. The Company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of non-recurring and non-operational amounts and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, and (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding non-recurring and non-operational amounts are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.Please see tables 1 through 5 and the sections entitled ""Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue"" and ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.Conference Call Information:The Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter earnings release on Wednesday, August 30, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

(the ""Karl Lagerfeld transaction""); and (iv) the tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items. The Company excludes these amounts because it deems them to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that their exclusion (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others.

and (ii) the gain recorded in connection with the Karl Lagerfeld transaction.PVH CORP.Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue(In millions)As a supplement to the Company’s reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period).Constant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.GAAP Revenue% ChangeQuarter EndedGAAPPositive Impact ofForeign ExchangeConstantCurrency7/30/237/31/22Tommy Hilfiger International$818.8$769.06.5%3.3%3.2%Total Tommy Hilfiger1,139.21,078.55.6%2.1%3.5%Calvin Klein International625.4563.311.0%2.0%9.0%Total Calvin Klein940.2910.03.3%1.1%2.2%Total Revenue$2,207.0$2,132.03.5%1.5%2.0%Total Direct-to-Consumer$1,065.3$957.311.3%0.8%10.5%Directly Operated Digital Commerce$193.1$172.811.7%0.6%11.1%Wholesale$1,039.9$1,073.8(3.2)%2.3%(5.5)%Total Digital$455.5$506.5(10.1)%2.2%(12.3)%PVH CORP.Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP AmountsThe Company is presenting its 2023 estimated results on a non-GAAP basis by excluding (i) the restructuring costs incurred and expected to be incurred related to the 2022 cost savings initiative, consisting principally of severance and (ii) the estimated tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax item. The Company has provided the reconciliations set forth below to present its estimates on a GAAP basis and excluding the foregoing amounts.The 2023 estimated results are presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The Company believes presenting these results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional information to investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that excluding them (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The estimated tax effect associated with the above pre-tax item is based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated and concluded that the pre-tax item identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion is tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the applicable statutory income tax rates of the local jurisdictions.2023 Net Income Per Common Share ReconciliationsCurrent GuidanceFull Year2023(Estimated)Third Quarter2023(Estimated)GAAP net income per common shareApproximately $9.60Approximately $2.43Estimated per common share impact of item identified as non-GAAP exclusion$(0.75)$(0.27)Net income per common share on a Non-GAAP basisApproximately $10.35Approximately $2.70The GAAP net income per common share amounts presented in the above table, as well as the amounts excluded in providing non-GAAP earnings guidance, would be expected to change as a result of (i) acquisition, restructuring, divestment or similar transactions or activities, (ii) the timing and strategy of restructuring and integration initiatives or other one-time events, such as the 2022 cost savings initiative, that the Company engages in or suffers during the period, (iii) any market or other changes affecting the Company’s expected actuarial gain or loss on retirement plans, including the recent volatility in the financial markets, (iv) changes in the expected impacts of inflationary pressures, as well as unexpected additional impacts of the war in Ukraine and its broader macroeconomic implications, or (v) any discrete tax events including changes in tax rates or tax law and events arising from audits or the resolution of uncertain tax positions.PVH CORP.Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts (continued)Reconciliation of 2023 Constant Currency Revenue GuidanceCurrent GuidanceFull Year2023(Estimated)GAAP revenue increase3% to 4%Positive impact of foreign exchange1%Non-GAAP revenue increase on a constant currency basis2% to 3%Please refer to the section entitled ""Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue"" on page 17 of this release for a description of the presentation of constant currency amounts.Reconciliation of GAAP Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share to Diluted Net Income Per Common Share on a Non-GAAP BasisFull Year 2022Third Quarter 2022(Actual)(Actual)(In millions, except per share data)ResultsUnderGAAPAdjustments (1)Non-GAAPResultsResultsUnderGAAPAdjustments (2)Non-GAAPResultsNet income (loss)$200.4$(393.2)$593.6$(186.7)$(356.2)$169.5Total weighted average shares66.266.264.80.365.1Diluted net income (loss) per common share (3)$3.03$8.97$(2.88)$2.60(1)Represents the impact on net income in the year ended January 29, 2023 from the elimination of (i) a $78.4 million recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans in the fourth quarter of 2022, (ii) $43.0 million of net costs incurred in connection with the Russia business exit, consisting of noncash asset impairments, contract termination and other costs, and severance recorded in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a gain on contract terminations recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022; (iii) a $16.1 million gain recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the Karl Lagerfeld transaction; (iv) a $417.1 million noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates; (v) $20.2 million of restructuring costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 related to the 2022 cost savings initiative; and (vi) a $7.4 million net tax expense associated with the foregoing pre-tax items.(2)Represents the impact on net (loss) income in the quarter ended October 30, 2022 from the elimination of (i) a $417.1 million noncash goodwill impairment charge, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates; (ii) $16.7 million of restructuring costs incurred related to the 2022 cost savings initiative; and (iii) a $77.6 million tax benefit associated with the foregoing pre-tax items.(3)GAAP diluted net loss per common share for the period ended October 30, 2022 excluded all potentially dilutive securities because there was a net loss for the period and, as such, the inclusion of these securities would have been anti-dilutive.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230829339641/en/ContactsInvestors: Sheryl Freeman (212) 381-3980 investorrelations@pvh.comMedia: communications@pvh.com]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the luxury goods industry, go to the 5 Best Global Luxury Stocks to Buy.According to JPMorgan, even though the US consumer is reducing expenditure on non-essential items, the demand for luxury goods remains robust. The research by the New York-based diversified financial services firm revealed that the luxury goods industry grew by 7% year-over-year (YoY) during Q4 2022, underscoring the industry's ability to withstand challenges. Consumers have been showing an inclination toward luxury goods by drawing upon their accumulated savings from the COVID-19 pandemic period. JPMorgan’s findings suggest that excess savings in the US peaked at around $2.1 trillion in Q2 2021 and fell to around $800 billion by Q2 2022. These savings are projected to be entirely depleted by the third quarter of 2023.Chinese consumers, similar to their American counterparts, accumulated substantial savings due to the pandemic. JPMorgan estimates that the average savings rate in China rose from 29.9% in 2019 to 33.5% in 2022. The first two months of 2023 witnessed a notable rise in retail sales in China, registering a 17% YoY increase and attaining a four-year peak. Notably, industries such as gold and jewelry, cosmetics, and apparel were the primary drivers behind this retail boom. The Head of European Luxury and Sporting Goods at JPMorgan, Chiara Battistini, believes that if the pent-up demand for luxury goods is addressed completely, it could result in a YoY sales growth of 35% to 40% in the Chinese market. The expanding industry has led to a rising interest amongst investors in luxury brand stocks and luxury stocks ETFs like the Amundi S&amp;P Global Luxury (GLUX.DE), which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P Global Luxury Index.

Despite the global economic uncertainty, there is a widespread belief that there will be an increase in sales and market size of the luxury goods industry in the coming years. The study predicts a significant rise in the total number of luxury goods consumers, forecasting an increase from 400 million consumers presently to 500 million by the end of this decade. India is set to emerge as one of the fastest-growing luxury goods markets in the world, as its industry size is expected to grow 3.5 times by the end of this decade due to the evolving preferences of younger demographics. Some of the best luxury brands to invest in according to hedge funds include PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tesla, Inc.

(NYSE:STLA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We initiated a starter position in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”6. Ferrari N.V.

(NYSE:RACE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) (+26.48%): The luxury automaker’s long awaited Purosangue, their first four door, four seater vehicle, has proven so popular that the company announced that they have ceased accepting new orders as they are sold out through all of this year and into 2024. The Purosangue is designed not as copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.”In addition to Ferrari N.V.

In the more than 50 years since, his business - Woodley Building Maintenance (WBM) in Kansas City, Missouri - has grown into a family legacy that continues with his children, Tiffany and Terry, and his wife, Robery.""My dad's first sizeable contract was cleaning an office complex in Lee's Summit after his previous job went on strike,"" said Tiffany Woodley, the chief financial officer at WBM who joined in the family business at age 27. ""He didn't have the financing to do the work in Lee's Summit, so he got a loan from his old boss and the business grew from there.""Yet, as the business kept growing, Jimmy's former manager told him he needed something else on his side: a bank. That's where Mercantile Bank, which was eventually acquired by U.S. Bank, came in.""The banking relationship is something you talk with other business owners about,"" said Tiffany Woodley. ""I've always enthusiastically shared my experience with U.S. Bank because, even if it is a large bank, there is a small bank personality. When something does happen, I can always reach out to people and that's one of the main reasons I haven't entertained making any kind of change.""The oldest accounts at U.S. Bank with the WBM date back to 1977, with the partnership lasting through some of the most challenging times in recent memory. That includes during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Woodleys worked with U.S. Bank to apply for and receive a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was launched to help business owners keep their employees.WBM is owned and operated by Tiffany Woodley; her brother and WBM's president and chief operating officer, Terry Woodley; and her mother, Robery Woodley. It's a successful business that is steeped in history that all started with Jimmy, Terry Woodley said.""When Tiffany and I joined the company, it was already a good size to support our parents,"" said Terry Woodley, who joined the business when he was 30.

The company's shares have risen 12% this year, far outperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average's 4.26% increase over the same period, as it becomes the retailer of choice for bargain-minded shoppers navigating steep inflation.At a meeting in May, senior Walmart field leadership asked 20 market leaders - directors of 10 to 15 stores in a given area - to start asking pharmacists to voluntarily reduce their base salary hours, the source told Reuters.For example, a pharmacist could go from an 80-hour, two-week pay period to one lasting 64 or 72 hours, said the source, who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.The market leaders who attended the meeting represented Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Louisiana, though the move was presented as a nationwide one, the person said.Leaders were asked to start hiring pharmacists at lower base salaries, the source said, adding that the moves were being led by Davey Lavergne, Walmart's vice president of Health and Wellness.On average, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail chain pays its pharmacists more than $140,000 a year, excluding bonuses and incentives, according to Walmart.Walmart confirmed to Reuters that it was reducing the amount of hours it was offering some pharmacists, citing a dropoff in demand for drugs during the summer and requests from pharmacists for a better work-life balance.Story continuesA Walmart spokesperson, Marilee McInnis, said the company was ""committed to creating a great place to work"" through work-life balance and competitive pay, and was hiring pharmacists as it sees demand for their services grow.Earlier this year, Walmart scaled back the operating hours of its pharmacies by two hours at more than 4,500 U.S. stores, amid a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians that began during the pandemic.Michael Hogue, CEO of the American Pharmacists Association in Washington, said there was no data to support the assertion that demand for medications falls during the summer and that pharmacists need fewer hours to fill prescriptions.SHORTAGE OF PHARMACY TECHNICIANSThe underlying reason that chain drug stores like Walmart are scaling back pharmacists' hours is a shortage of pharmacy technicians, Hogue said. Technicians handle tasks such as counting pills, answering phones and stocking shelves, enabling pharmacists to focus on filling prescriptions. But technicians don't hold pharmacy degrees and are paid less than pharmacists.According to a study by the Pharmacy Workforce Center released in May, nearly 80% of respondents working at chain pharmacies considered the shortage of technicians to be severe or very severe.At the same time, the growing popularity of diabetes medications, which have become popular weight-loss drugs, have further increased workloads. In its latest quarter ended July 31, Walmart said drugs like Ozempic boosted health and wellness sales by percentages in the high teens, but also dragged down profit margins.The company does not break out revenues from its 5,000 pharmacies, most of which are in rural areas. Pharmacy sales come under the company's health and wellness business, which comprised 11% of Walmart's total U.S. revenue last year.Walmart last year agreed to pay $3.1 billion as part of the nationwide opioid settlement following allegations that it failed to regulate prescriptions of the painkillers.The settlement includes many court-ordered compliance requirements which must be carried out by pharmacists, experts say.Pharmacists have complained that this adds to their workload while they must fill the same volume of prescriptions with fewer people and work hours, according to posts on Facebook and independent message boards frequented by Walmart employees.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Andy Sullivan)]"

Jefferies Vice President of Equity Research Corey Tarlowe joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss consumer spending patterns.""50% of the people who we surveyed actually intend to spend more into back-to-school,"" Tarlowe says on the survey of 600 U.S. consumers. ""But clicking a little deeper, 70% actually cited inflation as the primary reason that they're spending more.""Tarlowe uses credit card debt and earnings data from retailers like Walmart (WMT) to forecast what could be in store for retailers in 2023's holiday season.Video Transcript- Well, now despite those inflationary pressures, American shoppers do intend to spend more on back to school supplies this year than last year. That's according to a new survey conducted by Jefferies. Let's bring in one of the authors behind the Study, Corey Tarlowe, Jefferies' vice president of equity research. Good to see you here, Corey. So for some of us, as parents out here, we're really feeling the pain here. Why is everything so much more expensive, and where are we seeing the biggest markup this year?COREY TARLOWE: Great. Well, thank you for having me. I think that the reason that things are so much more expensive is clear, and it's inflation. According to the survey that we did, we conducted a survey of 600 consumers in the US. And what we found that was interesting is that 50% of the people who we surveyed actually intend to spend more into back to school. But clicking a little deeper, 70% actually cited inflation as the primary reason that they're spending more.And as you click down by category, interestingly enough, apparel was one category where people are not only planning to spend more, but also even perhaps buy more units. So 50% of people plan to spend more in dollars on apparel, and again, that's because of inflation. And then 30% of people plan to buy more units in this category.Story continues- See, Corey, Rachelle is better than me because I would finna be right next to my student, right next to my kid in class if I'm spending all this money. I'm getting the education too. I'm brushing up on some of that stuff. I'm spending all that just for back to school. But all of this spending considered, what does this really tell us or forecast about the rest of the year? Because it's making it through back to school but also making it to the holiday season that many consumers might also be thinking about, and that credit card debt is starting to rack up a little bit more.COREY TARLOWE: Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up. So we have seen a consumer that's overall a little bit more resilient than what we expected. But we are seeing credit card debt continue to pile on for many consumers in the US. And so as a result of that, and this survey data that we conducted actually showed this, is that private label is becoming an increasing area of focus.And you mentioned that buying many branded items can be a pain point for you. Well, store branded items, particularly private label at a retailer like Walmart, are really resonating strongly with a lot of consumers in the US. And so our survey data indicated that 77% of respondents are actually likely to spend more on store brand items.And so as I think about a retailer that could benefit from this, it's Walmart. Because Walmart has, at least in the US, a private label business that's over 20% of sales, and that's a $400 billion enterprise in the US that again is over 20% private label. So that's $80 billion in private label sales, and that's one thing that I expect that well-positions Walmart not only to back to school but into holiday as well.- And what about the companies who used to benefit from this? Obviously, they're losing some market share now to the Walmarts of the world. Who is then falling off then if Walmart is now picking up the benefit of this?COREY TARLOWE: Well, I think Walmart's definitely taking a lot of share from many players in the retail space, whether it's traditional grocers or other mass players or even some convenience stores. So it's definitely a business that is gaining a lot of share not only online but also in stores.So far, at least quarter to date, we've seen Walmart comp up in the mid-single digits based on where they've guided, and then Target is comping down in discretionary categories in the low double digit to mid-teens in categories like home or apparel and hardlines. So there may be some continued underperformance in that category ahead at Target and perhaps a little bit of a better performance at Walmart ahead.]"

D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker says that right now, there is a ""more promotional environment"" caused by retailers' desire to get people into the stores. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Baker tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""this holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic,"" with traditional door-buster sales. Overall, Baker says the best positioned retailers are Walmart (WMT), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Costco (COST), who all benefit from the increase in consumers looking for deals. Baker's other top picks include Ulta Beauty (ULTA), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), and Lowe's (LOW).Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: In some of the categories where consumers are continuing to show that they're either looking for a big discount, or waiting for a major sale or promotion to take place, what can you extrapolate from these numbers and apply towards, say, the Labor Day sales, or even further out some of the holiday shopping season sales. Are we going to see major doorbusters, and those deals that consumers have come to expect on a cyclical basis, because there's inventory that needs to be moved through, or just because Best Buy is going to have to do something to entice the customers back into the store here for some of the larger ticket items?MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah sure, a lot there. So it is a more promotional environment, absolutely. We are seeing it more promotional, we expect that over the holiday season. It's more because of the second thing you said, it's just to spur demand and get people to come on in and shop.It's less about inventory. Inventory is actually pretty clean right now, not just for Best Buy, but for a lot of retailers. That was a major issue last year. Most retailers, not all, there's still some pockets of heavy inventory. But most retailers have their inventory well under control. But it is more promotional just to get the consumer to come back in.Story continuesAs relates to Best Buy, the good news is, a lot of it is vendor-funded right now, because the vendors have the same incentive that Best Buy has, and that's to get people back in the store. So it is more promotional than last year. This holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic, which is those traditional doorbusters, and those types of things, those types of call to calls to action.Best Buy did say something interesting on the call today, and that is that some of their back-to-school categories are actually doing better than expected, typically that bodes well for the holiday season. Back-to-school points in the right direction for holiday sales in 85% of the time.BRAD SMITH: And so does that mean that we are to believe, and is expected now that the worst in the tech demand, and that lull is behind US?MICHAEL BAKER: Does feel like that. So we're still down year-over-year. But remember, we were down 10% in the first quarter, and then towards the end of last year. This quarter down 6%, and Best Buy is trending at down 5% in August.Still not out of the woods yet, but getting a little bit better. And Best Buy does think it's possible that holiday sales could be closer to flat. So we are trending in the right direction.There are some interesting green shoots that we heard about, in talking to the company. Laptop units were actually flat year-over-year, that's a good sign. TV units are actually up year-over-year. Gaming was a strong category. So there are definitely some positive signs that we're seeing.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Michael, as we're seeing consumers continue to trade down or trade off, which of the retailers do you think are best positioned, going into the holiday season, and beyond, keeping in mind that we are in an interest rate higher for longer environment.MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah, well bigger picture, we think among the best positioned retailers this holiday season, is Walmart, for sure. They span the spectrum of categories. But when the consumer is trading down, we are seeing some of that. We think Walmart is particularly well positioned in this environment.We think the clubs as well are well-positioned. A name like BJ's has added a lot to their general merchandise offering, and we think that could help their holiday seasons. Costco always does well in that kind of trade down environment as well.BRAD SMITH: And so from an investor perspective here, when you think about some of the top names in retail that investors should be paying close attention to, even amid what Corie Barry, the Best Buy CEO, continues to call a very unfamiliar, or all too familiar macroeconomic environment with several challenges, who would some of those top picks be?MICHAEL BAKER: Well, it's all about expectations and what's already embedded in the stock price. And sometimes the best sales performance doesn't necessarily mean the best stock. But that being said, best ideas, again, Walmart, we think, is particularly well positioned here. We like ALTA on the pullback that we've seen. We think that represents good value for a name-taking market share.Another name that we highlighted as a best idea earlier in the year, and has done particularly well, we haven't really talked about in this conversation, O'Reilly Auto Parts, that space is doing very well. And then the last one we'll throw out is Lowe's, Lowe's has been a particularly good stock this year. For them it's all about closing the margin gap with Home Depot, and through new management over the last couple of years, they've been able to do that.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It certainly makes sense as people try and do more at home with their cars, and with their homes, as well, that those are some of the companies that would also be doing well. A big thank you there to Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst. Thank you for your time this morning.]"

Investopedia Editor-In-Chief Caleb Silver joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how investors are reacting to consumer spending trends, such as on travel experiences.""People have also been spending in and around their home and their home experience trying to get that ready for the fall, for the back-to-school season,"" Silver says. ""Investors, again, on the fence, should they stay or should they go? It's kind of a Clash moment for a lot of investors wondering which direction the market's going to go. When the stock market has such a strong first half of the year like we had, it produces what we call the wealth effect.""Silver also comments on credit card spending in retailers and grocery stores, and how big-ticket producers like Tesla (TSLA) are enacting price action to entice consumers.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Are we getting some clarity into what people are spending on within services? How are they still willing to put that money to work, even though, as we're looking at credit card debt mounting, they're clearly not able to balance that budget right now.CALEB SILVER: Yeah, well travel was very big, and very big this summer. We did see that spike in gas prices over the last month or so. I think a lot of people put money into that. But I think people have also been spending in and around their home and their home experience, trying to get that ready for the fall, for the back to school season. So consumers, again, feeling a little bit tapped out here.Investors again on the fence. Should they stay or should they go? It's a clash moment for a lot of investors, wondering which direction the market's going to go, and if momentum is going to be there.When the stock market has such a strong first half of the year, like we had, it produces what we call the wealth effect. It makes people feel wealthier, because they're watching shows like this. They're seeing the averages move higher. And then when you get this pullback, you get this feeling of, Oh, are we about to have another moment like we had back in 2020, or like we had last year, or like we had in 1999. So there's still a lot of psychological damage from those crashes.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: I think we all look at charts, like the one that was just up, and think about what that credit card spending leads to in terms of long-term debt, and what broader implications that has on the economy and the consumer, even further out from here. Because that's something that's been cited in terms of the delinquency rates that are now rising from many of the retail CEOs over the course of this earnings period too. How concerned should they be about those delinquency rates in the long-term ramifications?CALEB SILVER: Yeah, well right now they're pretty small, though they are growing. We're seeing a higher trend, the Fed noted it in its report recently about the record credit card debt. So that's starting to boil up. And that hurts lower income folks the most, because they can't avoid the big spend at the grocery store.They can't avoid filling up their car with gas and shelter. Those are the three things that are costing the most right now. Food, food away from home, shelter. And gasoline prices. So they can't avoid that, that hurts that lower income consumer the most.The higher income consumer is doing OK, as long as they're employed. And we have seen wage growth at 4, 4.5%. So that's buffering some of that a little bit. But I think we're going to see the slowdown first in the lower income, and then move its way a little bit higher.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, obviously, a lot of these retailers still want to be attractive to some people who are trying to be a bit more budget conscious. How do they walk that fine line between not discounting so much that it affects their margins, versus still being able to attract all these consumers and try, and scoop up those dollars?CALEB SILVER: Yeah, look at the retail earnings we've seen so far. Target obviously not performing very well right now, because people are being a little bit more cost conscious. And then you look at Walmart, which had a much stronger quarter.But Walmart has a lot more broader offerings. They have the groceries, they also have the goods, and they also stack them high and let them fly. They're willing to discount at scale, because they have enough sales volume to handle it.But some of these other retailers, there's a point at which it really hurts their margins too much to keep discounting. And if the consumer doesn't feel strong enough to make purchases, then discounting doesn't really make a lot of sense.But take it outside the retail sector for a second and look at a company like Tesla that's done intense discounting to move volumes. That's actually worked for the company, because it continues to grow market share, even though it's cut way into its profit margin.]"

Macy's has opted to write off those balances.""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with Wall Street analysts.""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Macy's execs added that the retailer is seeing the most acute pressure among households earning $75,000 and under.High-end department store Nordstrom (JWN) also saw credit card challenges in the second quarter, per its earnings release a week ago.Read more: How to consolidate credit card debt with a personal loanThe impact of higher interest rates were evident throughout Best Buy's second quarter.Best Buy notched sizable sales declines in key departments that often get funded on credit, such as mobile phones, consumer electronics, and appliances.Story continuesThe company also forecast a potential same-store sales decline in the all-important holiday quarter.The earnings rundownNet sales: -7.2% year over year to $9.58 billion vs. estimates for $9.53 billionSame-store sales: -6.2% vs. estimates for 6.4%Domestic same-store sales: -7.1%International same-store sales: -5.4%Gross profit margin: 27% vs. 21.5% a year ago and estimates for 22.61%Diluted EPS: -21% year over year to $1.22 vs. estimates for $1.07What else caught our attention2Q domestic segment gross profit margins rose to 23.1% from 22% last year.2Q international segment operating profit margins fell to 2.7% from 3.7% a year ago.2Q overall operating margins were unchanged year on year at 3.6%.2Q inventory fell 6.5% from a year ago, slower than the pace of sales.2Q same-store sales declines in the domestic segment: computing and mobile phones -6.4%; consumer electronics -5.7%; appliances -16%.2Q same-store sales increases in the domestic segment: entertainment up 9%; services up 7.6%; other up 2.4%.2Q same-store sales fell in all segments for the international segment, except for a 2.5% increase in entertainment and a 4.6% gain in services.3Q same-store sales seen as ""slightly better"" than the 6.2% drop in the second quarter.2023 EPS guidance: $6.00 to $6.40 vs. estimates for $6.06 (prior: $5.70 to $6.50)Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Source: MGM Resorts. Hyatt, Marriott, and MGM Resorts have been hit with lawsuits since 2019 over how they disclose mandatory resort fees. The companies have since changed how they disclose resort fees on their websites and apps.Hyatt in July began displaying nightly rates plus resort fees upfront on a traveler’s first search of its site and app, a spokesperson confirmed to Skift on Tuesday. The decision followed Marriott’s similar move in May and MGM Resort’s similar (and unpublicized) move earlier.Yet these moves won’t end the debate over junk fees. Lingering issues include how hotel rates and fees are displayed on online travel agencies; the fact that resort fees are mandatory; and how these fees are taxed in cities with hotel occupancy taxes.Hyatt and MGM Resorts Change on Resort Fees“After careful consideration, we made the decision to move to what we call an all-in rate display for hotels in the Americas,” a Hyatt spokesperson said. “As of July, the most prominent rate shown throughout the booking process on Hyatt channels for properties in the Americas now includes both the room rate and any resort or destination fees. This rate does not include taxes.”In May, Texas’ attorney general sued Hyatt over its hidden resort fees.MGM Resorts made a similar change without a public statement in 2021. The casino and hotel operator now discloses the mandatory resort fee for its 17 properties at the first stage of the search process on its site and app.Marriott began in May to display resort fees upfront for its 30-plus brands on its site and app. The move came in the wake of a 2021 legal settlement with Pennsylvania — which required the hotel operator to immediately disclose any extra fees for services and amenities offered during a guest’s stay.This October, Marriott International will start displaying 17 MGM Resorts properties on its site and mobile app as part of a licensing partnership. Marriott’s site and app will include the mandatory resort fees MGM Resorts in the first rates shown, a spokesperson said.Story continuesIn other words, the first rates that guests comparing MGM Resorts properties on Marriott will first see will be prices inclusive of the resort fees. Travelers booking directly on MGM Resorts’ own site and app will see the rate and fee broken out on the first result instead.Why It MattersDisclosing fees is important. When they are disclosed is important as well. Do it at the end of the process, and the buyer may be surprised by the true cost. A delay prevents a traveler from easy comparison shopping. That’s one reason why talk about so-called junk fees has grown louder this year.A case in point: Until 2021, whenever a consumer clicked on one of MGM Resorts’ properties in its search interface, they saw a rate advertised in a large font in a colored box. Meanwhile, news that a daily resort fee would be extra was shared in a small font in gray elsewhere on the page. At the last step in the online booking process, the purchaser was shown a line item for the resort fee, along with all other costs, taxes, and fees.In a lawsuit in 2021, Travelers United, an advocacy group, alleged that MGM Resorts’ practice violated laws against price deception for residents of Washington, D.C. MGM Resorts settled in October 2021, said Lauren Wolfe of Travelers United.Multiple Hotel Brands AffectedMarriott, Hyatt, and MGM Resorts had, until this year, been hardly alone in delayed disclosure of resort fees on their sites and apps.Hilton denies wrongdoing as alleged in an ongoing lawsuit against it on this issue by Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson launched in 2019. Texas is also suing Hilton.Some Choice Hotels franchisees, such as the M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas, charge resort fees without those fees being included in the upfront total rates on Choice’s site. Some Wyndham franchisees also engage in the practice, such as The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel, without Wyndham including the fees in total prices displayed.Many smaller brands also charge resort fees.Have the Hotel Companies Done Enough?Marriott, Hyatt, and MGM Resorts still face some outstanding grievances from some consumer advocates and government representatives.“This is a positive step forward, but it actually does very little for consumers comparing hotel prices on booking sites like Expedia and Priceline,” said Randy Greencorn, who runs the site Resort Fee Checker. “On third parting booking sites typically display the price per night before resort fees, making hotels with resort fees appear less expensive than they actually are. This is potentially misleading.”It’s not fully clear who or what is responsible for that reality. This month, Texas filed suit against Booking Holdings, owner of Booking.com and other sites, for not disclosing resort fees and other fees upfront.Hotel groups also quote prices without resort fees in ad and marketing campaigns.At the municipal level, some U.S. cities charge a hotel occupancy tax, and they only tax a hotel’s advertised rate — meaning that resort fees appear to lead to lost tax revenue. In some jurisdictions, like New York City, major companies like Marriott are properly charging the city occupancy tax on the resort fee. But other companies, especially smaller ones, aren’t.Some activists complain that, in specific cases, the resort fees don’t provide legitimate value to guests as they occasionally include seemingly frivolous things like access to pools that all guests get access to anyway or offers of discounts for services some guests will want to opt out of.“Unlike the unbundled fees airlines charge that you can opt out of and fly in a seat, hotel resort fees can’t be opted out of, which is why we say their purpose is deceptive pricing,” Wolfe said.Yet of all the gripes, it’s worth noting that the landmark Pennsylvania case against Marriott focused on the upfront bundled display of rates that Marriott adopted in May.More Momentum?It’s unclear how large of an issue junk fees are.Research analysts at Truist believe U.S. hotel groups haven’t expanded the practice since 2019, with resort fees remaining “a modest” amount of total revenues — between 1 and 2 percent — based on data from HotStats, a benchmarking service.A survey by the hotel sector’s main lobby found that 94% of hotels don’t charge resort fees, said American Hotel and Lodging Association president and CEO Chip Rogers.“Since 2015, both the nightly resort fee rate and the number of hotels charging resort fees has continued to grow,” said Greencorn of Resort Fee Checker. “For instance, the average resort fee was $16.83 per night in 2015 and is now $26.50 per night, with many hotels charging more than $50 per night.”Marriott had roughly 180 hotels charging resort fees out of roughly 5,000, ringing up about $220 million in revenue between 2012 and 2019, according to Washington, D.C.’s attorney general.Yet the term “junk fees” has caught on in less than a year for a few reasons. Pennsylvania’s lawsuit against Marriott has inspired other lawsuits. Plus, a few national politicians, including President Joe Biden, are trying to use junk fees as a talking point.google trends on phrase resort fee to August 2023“All sorts of pressure from multiple groups, such as the president himself, many states attorneys general, and other sources have been pushing hotel companies to be less deceptive in how they display their resort fee prices,” Wolfe said.Context on Hotel FeesTravel ‘Junk Fee’ Crackdown: Skift ExplainsOpen Letter to the Travel Industry: You Won’t Win This ‘Junk Fee’ FightMarriott to Bet on Gaming With MGM Resorts Loyalty Program Tie-UpGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Between January and March this year, the U.S. economy also advanced at an annual rate of 2%, well above analysts’ estimates.A burst of business investment drove growth in the second as well as first quarters.

Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 2/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 2/105. Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd the GF Score of 57 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings LtdNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Story continuesIs Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength AnalysisNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0, positions it worse than 0% of 559 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just -0.21, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.07 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 903.85, which is worse than 100% of 667 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 21.12, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 93.19% of 573 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -27.2 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 85.57% of 769 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Lastly, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd has a strong brand and a significant market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

34,867b8a57-bbaa-37b6-8b9d-557fb2048118,MCHP,2023-08-30,7 Very Oversold Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-very-oversold-tech-stocks-203312186.html,1692822792,STORY,"['PYPL', 'CHGG', 'KEYS', 'CHPT', 'MCHP']","[Some of the technology sector’s biggest names captured much of the renewed investor enthusiasm, leaving small- and mid-cap companies in the dust. However, if you dig deep enough you’ll still find severely oversold tech stocks. To help us find them, I’ll use the relative strength index (RSI) to identify some of those still considered oversold. Usually, an RSI hovering around 30 or below indicates oversold status. At the same time, we’ll look to see whether the oversold conditions are warranted – or represent a perfect buying opportunity.Oversold Tech Stocks: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPioneering fintech company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is having a rough year. Although its recent earnings report fell short of estimates, PayPal’s industry dominance is still strong. PayPal maintains 41% of the global online payment processing market, with second-place competitor Stripe holding a measly 21%. Furthermore, PayPal’s financials remain solid and sustainable, even if not spectacular. Missing analyst estimates, PayPal nevertheless reported a respectable 7% year-over-year uptick in revenue, a 2% margin increase, and an 11% reduction in non-operating expenses. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs the digital payment landscape evolves, PayPal remains a major player with its wide-reaching user base and established infrastructure. Factors such as the increasing preference for cashless transactions and the growing eCommerce market underscore the company’s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, PayPal’s recent stablecoin entry in the crypto markets ensures the fintech giant remains on a forward technological footing. L3Harris Technologies (LHX)L3Harris (LHX) sign outsideSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comTech defense firm L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) just beat both earnings and revenue estimates in its recent Q2 earnings report.Notably, L3Harris hit a solid 13% year-over-year increase in sales, reflecting its ability to navigate challenging market conditions and remain dominant amid changing market conditions. The company’s strategic foresight will also pay dividends after successfully finalizing its Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. Story continuesThat acquisition is already paying off, as Aerojet Rocketdyne is among the most important players in the emerging space technology sector. For example, the company builds thrusters for NASA’s Orion project and high-altitude ballistic defense components. Under L3 Harris, the aerospace company will have greater access to new contracts alongside expanded logistic and manufacturing networks. Considering current stability and long-term outlook, the stock’s recent downturn is a viable entry point for this oversold stock.Oversold Tech Stocks: Paycom Software (PAYC)Source: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.comPaycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) is an online provider of payroll and human resource technology solutions that’s having trouble in today’s tighter labor market. While the stock is down 7% this year, recent developments paint an optimistic picture. In fact, the company’s second-quarter earnings outperformed expectations, showcasing its emerging adaptation to changing economic conditions.Looking ahead, the future appears promising for Paycom. Management projections indicate significant earnings growth in the next few years, reflecting the company’s strategic positioning in a dynamic market. Additionally, their expectations point to increased cash flows and share values.Robust quarterly performance and optimistic future forecasts suggest Paycom could rebound from its recent dip. As organizations increasingly adopt digital payroll and HR management solutions, the company’s offerings remain relevant and essential – and oversold. For investors assessing opportunities in the tech sector, Paycom could be a tremendous oversold stock to consider.Chegg (CHGG)Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWith back-to-school season here again, oversold EdTech company Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) is ready to capitalize on a wave of new and returning college students. Best known for its textbook rental service, Chegg’s stock is down 60% year-to-date. Still, there’s an upside for investors as Chegg explores more innovative products and expands past its current product offerings.Chegg is jumping on the AI craze and will soon unveil an AI-powered homework tool. The new venture “will combine the best of generative AI with Chegg’s proprietary high-quality content and demonstrated ability to help improve student outcomes.” With many attributing the year’s tech resurgence to AI-powered enthusiasm, Chegg’s new move may serve to bring the EdTech giant back up to speed with the broader market. In addition to its AI-focused product, Chegg signaled its commitment to shareholder loyalty through a new buyback program. As Chegg continues to evolve and explore AI-driven possibilities in the education sector, investors interested in education technology and innovation could find the company’s trajectory worth monitoring. With the company’s sell-off this year now could be an excellent time to consider this oversold EdTech stock.Oversold Tech Stocks: ChargePoint (CHPT)A close-up of an orange ChargePoint (CHPT) station.Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.comChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) fell 22% since Jan. That dip may be surprising, considering the broad electric vehicle (EV) market jumped 35% this year. The disparity between the two indicates that ChargePoint is oversold and poised for a comeback. As companies adapt to and surpass, restricted supply lines, a new EV rush will soon hit the roads and make ChargePoint a critical part of national (and global) infrastructure. Further growth opportunities also stem from expanding subscriptions as customers seek convenient and affordable charging solutions. This, coupled with the company’s recent performance, outperforming its earnings estimates, underscores its potential.Impressively, ChargePoint’s revenue surged by 57% year-over-year, reflecting the company’s ability to capitalize on the EV market. ChargePoint’s extensive charging network and revenue growth could attract investor interest as the world continues to transition toward sustainable transportation solutions.Keysight Technologies (KEYS)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) is a diverse, and oversold, electronic test and measurement equipment manufacturer with an array of diversified software solutions. The company has faced a challenging year, with its stock dropping 24%.In its recent earnings report, Keysight blew away expectations, but the stock took a hit based on a cautious outlook. While Keysight’s stock price has suffered, it’s important to consider the broader context. The field of electronics testing and measurement is vital for a wide range of industries, including telecommunications, electronics manufacturing, and research. Keysight’s products are crucial in ensuring the quality and reliability of electronic devices and technologies, and the demand for these solutions remains steady.Investors evaluating Keysight should consider its strong track record in the industry, its ability to innovate and adapt to changing technological landscapes, and the fundamental importance of its products. Short-term market sentiments influence the company’s recent stock performance. Still, its foundational role within the electronics sector indicates potential for recovery and growth as market conditions evolve.Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP)Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuitsSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMicrochip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is a key player in the electronics industry, specializing in producing microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog, and Flash-IP integrated circuits. Notably, the stock has displayed a positive trajectory, marking a 14% increase in value YTD.The company recently beat analysts’ expectations in the latest quarter. Institutional investors are taking advantage of the strong performance and oversold status, with one financial service firm buying $4.8 million worth of stock. Despite the challenges posed by the economic climate, Microchip remains optimistic about its growth prospects for the upcoming quarter. This resilience underscores its strategic agility and ability to navigate market fluctuations.Finally, Microchip’s position as an AI stock warrants attention. As industries increasingly integrate AI solutions, the demand for specialized microcontrollers and integrated circuits is expected to rise. Ultimately, investors should consider its consistent growth, financial stability, and potential for future expansion in emerging technology sectors. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusMetLife (MET) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -13.6% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.52 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.33%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.18% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4.44%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 33%. This means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MET is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.78 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 13.58%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its research reports, which have become essential for companies in various sectors, solidifies its top position in the market.Gartner has gained 19.1% in the past year compared with the Consulting Market industry’s 12.7% growth.Factors That Bode WellOver time, Gartner's research reports have been firmly established as essential resources for a wide range of companies. Utilizing advanced technology, Gartner provides vital insights and decision-making solutions drawn from extensive data sources. The acquisition of CEB further enhances Gartner's market presence, resulting in a well-rounded service portfolio. Renowned for its top-notch, impartial analysis, Gartner assists organizations in cost-saving and effectively navigating the ever-changing IT landscape, presenting a compelling value proposition.Gartner enjoys a vast, diversified market with low customer concentration, which minimizes operational risks.

QuoteGartner's commitment to rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases is commendable. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, Gartner bought back 3.8 million, 7.3 million, and 1.2 million shares at a cost of $1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $176.3 million, respectively. These actions demonstrate the company's dedication to enhancing shareholder value and showcasing the strong belief in its business. Additionally, such initiatives bolster investors’ confidence in the stock and have a favorable impact on earnings per share.Story continuesGartner's current ratio at the end of second-quarter 2023 was pegged at 0.87, higher than the current ratio of 0.62 reported at the end of the prior-year quarter. This indicates that the company should not have problems meeting its short-term debt obligations.Threats to GartnerGartner is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to its global operations, with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar impacting financial results against currencies like the British pound, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen.Consulting firms, including Gartner, face rising talent costs in a competitive labor market, which is heavily reliant on foreign talent.

38,09354b29-5b65-3679-9d29-28dbe7deeb0b,IT,2023-08-30,CEOs and CFOs don’t always see eye to eye. But working together through ‘constructive tension’ can help them align on these 3 key priorities,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceos-cfos-don-t-always-110120665.html,1693306880,STORY,['IT'],"[Good morning.CEOs and CFOs are strategic partners, but that doesn’t mean they never disagree.“One of the areas where we see a little bit of friction is with A.I., where we see CFOs being much more cautious with adoption and usage,” says Marko Horvat, a VP in Gartner’s research and advisory practice. I talked with Horvat about Gartner’s new report, “What Matters to CEOs and CFOs Right Now.”“The best CFOs in the best organizations,"" says Horvat, who has been a CFO, controller, and head of financial planning and analysis, ""take situations like this one to create constructive tension with CEOs, by addressing and challenging underlying assumptions to create a mutual foundation of understanding.""Overall, the C-suite execs are aligned on three key priorities through 2023 and 2024: technology, growth, and talent. This comes according to Gartner's ""CEO and Senior Business Executive Survey for 2023,"" which includes responses from more than 350 executives.CEOs and CFOs do tend to agree that A.I. will most significantly affect their business over the next three years. However, it's most likely not in play yet, according to Horvat. About 80% of the financial functions to include A.I. have done so just in the past two years, the survey found.When it comes to generative A.I., boards and chief executives expect C-suite leaders, including the CFO, to protect the company while driving broad use-case adoption. And investors expect new sources of growth and much better margins, which then places pressure on leaders to deliver results, according to Gartner.Top-line growthSpeaking of growth, 45% of the CEOs surveyed rank growth among their top three strategic priorities, down from 53% in 2022. Meanwhile, 62% of finance chiefs put it in their top three, up from 59%.“This speaks to CFOs having spent the last several quarters focusing on cost cutting and efficiency in reaction to, and preparation for, an economic downturn,” Horvat says. “As those initiatives have matured, CFOs are focusing more on top-line growth to enhance profitability.”Story continuesMcDonald's is a company where the CFO sees marketing as a growth center, not a cost center. During the fast-food giant's Q2 earnings call on July 28, Ian Borden pointed to the results of a focus on top-line growth. ""Our strong top-line performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of 25% in constant currencies,"" said Borden, adding that it also helped operating margins.According to Horvat, profitable growth through capital responsiveness will require CFOs to ""ruthlessly"" prioritize projects in alignment with strategic business priorities, make significant changes to where capital is allocated, and shift capital from low-value to high-value uses.Regarding talent, CEOs rank workforce issues as the second-most-pressing priority for their companies, while CFOs rank it fourth. According to Horvat, CFOs have been ""focusing on reviewing the competencies and capabilities of talent as part of their overall digital transformation,"" and most CEOs' focus is ""beyond talent as it relates to strategy,"" but ""as that gets settled, the focus then moves towards organization structure and the execution of the transformation strategy.”Whatever “constructive tension” CFOs and CEOs must power through, it's because they ultimately have the same goal in mind: to push their business forward.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Other ministries with leadership changes include defence, works and transport, and lands, housing and human settlements.Tanzania is due to hold its next elections in 2025.

But rising interest rates and higher construction costs have pushed up liquefaction fees, also known as tolling fees.""We would naturally expect increased costs of project development, due to higher interest rates or other factors, to have a corresponding impact on liquefaction fees,"" said Lyle Hanna, a vice president at Commonwealth LNG, one of several U.S. LNG export projects working toward financial approvals.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price has been much higher and is unlikely to return to the pre-invasion price levels, said Jason Bennett, a partner at law firm Baker Botts who negotiates LNG contracts.Bennett said the willingness by long-term customers to pay higher tolling fees and ultimately higher prices for U.S. LNG was because newer projects are still providing very good margins due to the low gas prices at the Henry Hub, the main trading point for U.S. natural gas futures.""U.S. LNG remains the best source of low cost LNG in the world...If the price used to be $2.25 (per million British thermal units) and it's $2.75 now, ok, but it's still the cheapest price of LNG anyway,"" said Bennett.The most recently approved project - NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG - increased its liquefaction fee as project costs rose, said Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence at LNG shipping and brokering firm Poten &amp; Partners.""NextDecade went back to their offtakers and sought an adjustment of their contract levels and our understanding is most of them agreed,"" Feer told Reuters.Story continuesNextDecade did not reply to questions about its processing fees. However, in a July 20 filing with the Department of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, NextDecade revealed amendments to its contracts with all its long-term customers except France's TotalEnergies and Japanese trading house Itochu .""The offtakers agreed because the project was very far advanced and was ready to go to FID (financial investment decision) and I think some of those contracts were very low-priced by current standards,"" Feer said.The largest U.S. LNG exporter Cheniere Energy has cut its project financing costs by funding its newest Stage 3 expansion project from its balance sheet.""Increasing our own equity in our projects and thereby reducing the level of debt required us to fund our expansions and is a competitive advantage,"" the company said.Other developers are turning to increased equity investment in new projects to reduce the impact of higher interest rates on finance costs, said Poten's Feer.

Chart 1 shows the relationship between Cultural Resonance Score and customer share.""For over 30 years, TMA has been powering brands' resonance across cultural platforms, using every form of content, experience, and partnership,"" said CEO Trina Roffino. ""Our many subject matter experts have uncovered consistent patterns for growing cultural resonance in their domains. With the Cultural Resonance Score, we've built a complement to our qualitative expertise, so we can now measure and monitor the impact of marketing activities on cultural resonance.""Resonance is built not merely through awareness, but through four pillars:Recognition: Clarity of the brand's role in the consumer's worldAlliance: The consumer's alignment to the brand's perspective on the worldEngagement: Willingness to spend one's most valuable resource—time—with a brandAdvocacy: Active participation within the brand's community, magnifying its message to the worldStory continuesA brand's Cultural Resonance Score is calculated as an average of the four pillars.Among the key findings of this report:1. Amazon, Google and Crayola are the three most resonant brands, followed by Apple and Target, when looking at the total population over age 18 (see Chart 2).""Crayola surprised us, but it makes sense,"" said Kathleen Colditz, EVP of Strategy at TMA, who spearheaded the project. ""They have endured for generations with an evolving product mix that stays true to the brand's purpose; therefore Recognition and Alliance. And they've invested in experience and influencers, which help lift Engagement and Advocacy. Every marketer should want to dominate their category the way Crayola does.""2. The top brands by pillar are as follows. RECOGNITIONDisney, Apple, Google, Nike, Chick-Fil-AALLIANCECrayola, Levi's, Amazon, M&amp;Ms, GoogleENGAGEMENTCrayola, Lego, Amazon, Google, M&amp;MsADVOCACYTarget, Chick-Fil-A, Crayola, Amazon, Campbell'sThe variety indicates that every brand—even those that are already dominant in a pillar or overall—has areas of opportunity.3. YouTube, Apple, Marvel, Target and Google are the 5 most resonant brands to Gen Z (see Chart 3).4. The most resonant brands share a combination of:High recognitionAn ability to build an alliance and engagement that yields distinction among their most loyal consumer baseSuccess in driving engagement beyond shoppingFor example, Amazon has grown Prime Day from a set of discounts to a holiday that has reshaped the shopping calendar. Apple's developer conference has become live info-tainment for fans and media worldwide.5. Chocolate, video games and toys are the top culturally resonant categories, followed closely by e-Commerce retailers (e.g., Amazon, Target) and pet care products. These categories all score in the 90th percentile.6. Cultural Resonance Score yields insights about specific categories. For example:Autos:  Trucks are more culturally resonant than sedans; Toyota is the most culturally resonant auto brand.Beer:  Beer lags tequila and wine; craft beers top traditional brands, with Hop Valley garnering the highest score within the category.DATATo develop the Cultural Resonance Score, TMA worked with BERA.ai, which is powered by the world's largest syndicated brand equity data stream. BERA's Brand Intelligence Software automates the real-time collection, analysis, and measurement of 130+ consumer-based metrics across 4,000+ brands in 200+ sectors globally. The TMA Cultural Resonance Score reflects a brand's ability to capture consumers in a category with 85% accuracy.IMPLICATIONSCultural Resonance is achieved when a) audiences have clarity of the brand's point-of-view in the world; b) the point-of-view is meaningful to the audience; c) the audience is so engaged with the brand that they spend time with it; and d) they become brand advocates.Creating cultural resonance requires commitment, consistency, and empathy. But as the results demonstrate, it's well worth it.TMA plans to publish its Cultural Resonance Score rankings annually and will also provide and track the performance of its clients. By monitoring these scores, brands can:Identify areas of weakness/opportunityImplement strategies and tactics to address those areasMonitor their brand and competitors' progress over timeFor further information and/or to obtain a Cultural Resonance Score, contact Jean Scheidnes at jscheidnes@themarketingarm.com.ABOUT TMA (The Marketing Arm)TMA (https://www.wearetma.agency) pushes past relevance to create true cultural resonance for brands.

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on GuruFocus' valuation method, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is estimated to be significantly undervalued. The stock's fair value is calculated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $207.97 per share, Salesforce stock is estimated to be significantly undervalued.Story continuesBecause Salesforce is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Unveiling Salesforce (CRM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Here's a look at Salesforce's debt and cash over the past years:Unveiling Salesforce (CRM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Over the past 12 months, Salesforce's ROIC was 1.26, while its WACC came in at 11.51.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Salesforce is shown below:Unveiling Salesforce (CRM)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Following this news, shares of the company jumped 5.2% at the close of business on Aug 28.The $5.5 billion funding is expected to be paid in the next five years. 3M has been fighting legal battles related to its earplugs for years. Veterans had claimed that combat earplugs caused them hearing loss, while MMM contended that the earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield.The combat earplugs supplied to the U.S. military were developed by 3M’s subsidiary, Aearo Technologies LLC. In July 2022, MMM put Aearo Technologies into bankruptcy to shield itself from the lawsuits. Per rules, companies that file for bankruptcy usually get some respite from lawsuits. However, the U.S. court denied a preliminary injunction to MMM’s lawsuits.3M Company Price3M Company Price3M Company price | 3M Company QuotePer reports, 3M has lost in 10 of the 16 trials, with about $300 million being awarded to plaintiffs.

If you want to skip our discussion on the luxury goods industry, go to the 5 Best Global Luxury Stocks to Buy.According to JPMorgan, even though the US consumer is reducing expenditure on non-essential items, the demand for luxury goods remains robust. The research by the New York-based diversified financial services firm revealed that the luxury goods industry grew by 7% year-over-year (YoY) during Q4 2022, underscoring the industry's ability to withstand challenges. Consumers have been showing an inclination toward luxury goods by drawing upon their accumulated savings from the COVID-19 pandemic period. JPMorgan’s findings suggest that excess savings in the US peaked at around $2.1 trillion in Q2 2021 and fell to around $800 billion by Q2 2022. These savings are projected to be entirely depleted by the third quarter of 2023.Chinese consumers, similar to their American counterparts, accumulated substantial savings due to the pandemic. JPMorgan estimates that the average savings rate in China rose from 29.9% in 2019 to 33.5% in 2022. The first two months of 2023 witnessed a notable rise in retail sales in China, registering a 17% YoY increase and attaining a four-year peak. Notably, industries such as gold and jewelry, cosmetics, and apparel were the primary drivers behind this retail boom. The Head of European Luxury and Sporting Goods at JPMorgan, Chiara Battistini, believes that if the pent-up demand for luxury goods is addressed completely, it could result in a YoY sales growth of 35% to 40% in the Chinese market. The expanding industry has led to a rising interest amongst investors in luxury brand stocks and luxury stocks ETFs like the Amundi S&amp;P Global Luxury (GLUX.DE), which tracks the performance of the S&amp;P Global Luxury Index.

Despite the global economic uncertainty, there is a widespread belief that there will be an increase in sales and market size of the luxury goods industry in the coming years. The study predicts a significant rise in the total number of luxury goods consumers, forecasting an increase from 400 million consumers presently to 500 million by the end of this decade. India is set to emerge as one of the fastest-growing luxury goods markets in the world, as its industry size is expected to grow 3.5 times by the end of this decade due to the evolving preferences of younger demographics.

The company is evaluating the possibility of spinning off the Italian luxury automotive brand Maserati, which was founded in 1914. However, before taking such an action, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) intends the brand to reach an operating margin of 15% in the next 12 months as opposed to 8.7% in 2022. This is part of a larger plan to achieve a long-term operating margin of 20% by the end of the decade.Miller Value Partners shared its outlook on Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We initiated a starter position in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”6. Ferrari N.V.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) as the top pick at Morgan Stanley in March 2023 as it was termed resistant to the impact of a possible recession.Here's what Ensemble Capital Management said about Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) (+26.48%): The luxury automaker’s long awaited Purosangue, their first four door, four seater vehicle, has proven so popular that the company announced that they have ceased accepting new orders as they are sold out through all of this year and into 2024. The Purosangue is designed not as copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.”In addition to Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE), some of the best global luxury stocks to buy include PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH), Tesla, Inc.

61,e00a1ebf-24b6-3d11-aba8-cca79584cac5,MCO,2023-08-30,"Moody's Insiders Sell US$11m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moodys-insiders-sell-us-11m-130033759.html,1693314033,STORY,['MCO'],"[Over the past year, many Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Moody's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Moody'sOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Raymond McDaniel, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$297 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$335, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 5.1% of Raymond McDaniel's holding.Insiders in Moody's didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Moody's Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Moody's. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Moody's Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Moody's insiders own about US$120m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Moody's Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Moody's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Moody's you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

62,4ec13150-f206-3fae-8c3a-29424c02ec49,PCG,2023-08-30,PG&E (PCG) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-pcg-upgraded-buy-160005130.html,1693324805,STORY,['PCG'],"[Investors might want to bet on PG&amp;E (PCG), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for PG&amp;E basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for PG&amp;E imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PG&amp;EFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this utility holding company is expected to earn $1.21 per share, which is a change of 10% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PG&amp;E. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of PG&amp;E to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

63,f3d4816e-afd4-3966-a3bd-bd6681066569,PCG,2023-08-30,Duke (DUK) Rolls Out North Carolina's EV Subscription Program,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duke-duk-rolls-north-carolinas-135600693.html,1693317360,STORY,"['DUK', 'F', 'GM', 'PCG', 'ETR', 'CMS']","[Duke Energy Corp. DUK recently rolled out an electric vehicle (EV) charging subscription program for its North Carolina customers to promote clean transportation at a cost-effective rate in this state. The company has unveiled this pilot program in collaboration with three vehicle manufacturers namely, General Motors, Ford Motor Company and BMW of North America.Highlights of the PlanPer Duke’s 12-month EV Complete Home Charging Plan, the company will provide its North Carolina residential customers with energy worth 800 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month to charge an EV at home. In return for this, DUK aims to charge a flat monthly rate of $19.99 in its Duke Energy Carolinas service area and $24.99 in its Duke Energy Progress service area.Customers who own an EV can enroll in the program from the beginning of September and enjoy the benefits of the program from Nov 1, 2023 onward.Such plans will assist the company in providing smart energy choices for its customers while ensuring grid stability.DUK’s Take on Electric VehiclesElectrification in the transportation sector has been on the radar of U.S. utilities as decarbonization remains a major target for the majority of industries across the board. To achieve this, utilities have been taking measures to provide customers with upgraded infrastructure for charging their EVs as well as incentives to promote the electrification of vehicles.Duke Energy has more than 600 EVs in its fleet, including more than 220 on-road vehicles. To lower emissions from the transportation sector, the company aims at increasing its EV fleet rapidly over the next few years.By 2030, DUK pledges to convert 100% of its nearly 4,000 light-duty vehicles to electric and 50% of its approximately 6,000 combined fleet of medium-duty, heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to EVs, plug-in hybrids or other zero-carbon alternatives as more of these options become available.With the solid expansion expected in the U.S. EV market in the next few years, such initiatives by Duke Energy, including the latest rollout of the EV subscription program, should strengthen its footprint in this market.Story continuesPeer MovesApart from Duke Energy, utilities that have been expanding their footprint in the EV market are as follows:Entergy Corporation’s ETR eTech program promotes the adoption of electric-powered alternatives to many applications that traditionally require fossil fuels. The program offers customers an incentive for purchasing EV charging infrastructure.Entergy boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ETR’s 2023 earnings suggests a growth rate of 4.5% from the prior-year reported figure.PG&amp;E Corporation PCG has proposed to build California’s EV charging infrastructure. As part of PG&amp;E’s 2030 targets, the company is preparing the grid to quickly and safely power at least three million EVs. In the second quarter of 2023, PCG initiated two pilot programs, Empower EV and Multifamily Business and Small Business EV Charger, both designed to improve access to EV charging infrastructure for customers in underserved communities.The long-term earnings growth rate of PG&amp;E Corp.is 2.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings calls for a growth rate of 10% from the prior-year reported figure.CMS Energy Corporation’s CMS Consumers Energy subsidiary is accelerating Michigan's EV transformation, committing to powering an additional 200 new EV charging stations across the state, including 100 fast chargers by the end of 2023. This is part of Consumers Energy's commitment to powering 1 million EVs in the communities it serves by 2030.CMS Energy’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 7.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMS’ 2023 earnings implies a growth rate of 7.6% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past three months, Duke Energy shares have increased 2.2% against the industry’s 2.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over Motorola Solutions' (NYSE:MSI) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Motorola Solutions is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$12b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Motorola Solutions has an ROCE of 28%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 8.9%. See our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions roceIn the above chart we have measured Motorola Solutions' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Motorola Solutions here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by Motorola Solutions' returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 28% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 42% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Our Take On Motorola Solutions' ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 137% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Motorola Solutions, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

A representative for the startup didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment outside normal business hours.OpenAI is regarded as one of several companies at the forefront of generative AI, which can create content from videos to poetry out of a few simple user commands. Since debuting its bot in November, OpenAI has worked with companies from fledgling firms to major corporations to incorporate the technology in their businesses and products.This month, it launched a corporate version of ChatGPT with added features and privacy safeguards, the startup’s most significant effort yet to attract a broad mix of business customers and boost revenue from its best-known product.The rollout of ChatGPT Enterprise is a move forward in OpenAI’s plans to make money from its ubiquitous chatbot, which is enormously popular but very expensive to operate because robust AI models require lots of computing power. The San Francisco-based startup has already taken steps toward generating revenue from ChatGPT, such as by selling a premium subscription and offering companies paid access to its application programming interface, which developers can use to add the chatbot to other apps.Story continuesRead more: OpenAI Unveils ChatGPT for Businesses, Stepping Up Revenue Push--With assistance from Rachel Metz.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekIs Carlos Alcaraz the Next Billion-Dollar Tennis Player?How a Tiny Mexican Border City Built a Budget Dental EmpireThe Hostile Takeover of Blue Cities by Red StatesNigeria’s Train to Nowhere Shows How Not to Build Public TransitCan You Name These Cities?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 4.3, the question arises, is the stock Fairly Valued? This article will delve into the valuation analysis of Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) to answer this critical question. So, let's get started.A Snapshot of Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)PAYX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PAYXEstablished in 1979, Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) services over 740,000 clients and pays over 1 in 12 U.S. private-sector workers.

With a current stock price of $120.87 and a GF Value of $127.97, Paychex has a market cap of $43.60 billion, indicating that the stock is fairly valued.Unveiling Paychex (PAYX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. As such, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is believed to be fairly valued based on the GF Value calculation.Unveiling Paychex (PAYX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial Strength of PaychexCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, investors must review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Paychex's cash-to-debt ratio of 1.84 ranks better than 59.12% of 1042 companies in the Business Services industry. The overall financial strength of Paychex is 8 out of 10, indicating strong financial health.Story continuesUnveiling Paychex (PAYX)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

(NASDAQ:XEL) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-10-return-equity-xcel-105704641.html,1693393024,STORY,['XEL'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xcel Energy is:10% = US$1.7b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.Does Xcel Energy Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Xcel Energy has a higher ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Xcel Energy by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Xcel Energy's Debt And Its 10% Return On EquityXcel Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.51. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Xcel Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

It envisions healthy demand to continue in most of its end markets in the third quarter of 2023.Demand in non-residential construction, the company’s biggest market, increased in the second quarter. Based on the current customer state and backlogs, the company remains cautiously optimistic that non-residential construction activity in the sectors in which it participates will continue to be healthy in the third quarter.Reliance Steel is also seeing higher demand for toll processing services for the automobile market. Its position in the automotive sector, together with recent advances in car production and the ongoing trend to increased aluminum content, gives the company confidence that demand for its toll processing services will remain strong in the third quarter.Commercial aerospace demand also remained substantial in the second quarter. RS expects commercial aerospace demand to improve further in the third quarter as build rates grow from 2022 levels. Moreover, demand in Reliance Steel's aerospace business's military, defense and space segments remained robust, with substantial backlogs. The trend is projected to continue in the third quarter.The company has been following an aggressive acquisition strategy for a while as part of its core business policy to drive operating results. The acquisitions of Rotax Metals, Admiral Metals and Nu-Tech Precision Metals are in sync with its strategy of investing in high-quality businesses. The acquisition of Southern Steel Supply also expands the company’s reach in the Southern United States and boosts its value-added processing services.Reliance Steel also remains committed to boost returns to shareholders. RS returned $132.5 million to its stockholders during the second quarter of 2023 through dividends and the repurchases.

Hence, this sale is an apt fit considering the current strategic overhaul.GS acquired GreenSky, a pre-eminent fintech platform that offers home-improvement consumer loans, to augment its retail lending footprint. However, this April, the company disclosed its intention to sell GreenSky, with management declaring that the business was not in line with the bank’s “current strategic priorities.”Goldman has various options regarding the sale of its consumer lending unit. This includes selling the entire unit along with the loans originated to a single buyer, or to different buyers. It could also consider retaining the loans and selling GreenSky.Apart from divesting its consumer lending platform, GS is scaling back its ambitions to serve the mass consumers and deciding to focus on serving the ultra-rich. Accordingly, it entered into an agreement to divest its Personal Financial Management unit to Creative Planning, a wealth management and registered investment advisor firm. Though the financial terms were not disclosed, the sale will result in a gain and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.Goldman’s shares have lost 4% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.45%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.85%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.74%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had lost 0.87% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 1.95% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.08% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.77, up 22.22% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.33 billion, up 11.44% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.98 per share and revenue of $32.91 billion. These totals would mark changes of +36.7% and +17.16%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Schlumberger is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesInvestors should also note Schlumberger's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.38. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.03.We can also see that SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Oil and Gas - Field Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.15 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Packaging Corporation of America’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America Is Packaging Corporation of America Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 15.46x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 13.57x, which means if you buy Packaging Corporation of America today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe Packaging Corporation of America should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, it seems like Packaging Corporation of America’s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Packaging Corporation of America look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 2.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PKG’s growth outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at PKG? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PKG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Packaging Corporation of America at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Packaging Corporation of America you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Packaging Corporation of America, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Aptiv is a leading provider of safety, infotainment and electronic control components to the automotive market. Our view was that the company was well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular industry trends—the shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, autonomous driving and increased computing intensity in vehicles. Over our holding period, a volatile macro environment (pandemic, supply chain shortages) steadily weighed on the profit cycle despite the company’s strong new business announcements. Furthermore, we believe the company may be increasingly disadvantaged as leading auto manufacturers work around tier-one suppliers (such as Aptiv) to maximize profits and speed to market. While the profit cycle may ultimately take hold, we concluded that several of our semiconductor holdings (ON Semiconductor, Lattice Semiconductor and Monolithic Power Systems) offer stronger leverage to these important new auto trends and decided to exit the position.""Story continuesTop 5 Cities with the Worst Drivers in the USCopyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoAptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

How the Company Is Now Raking In the Cash,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-become-netflix-subscriber-company-170023807.html,1693328423,STORY,['NFLX'],"[mphillips007 / Getty ImagesAs streaming competition builds and financial pressures intensify, in May, Netflix rolled out strict restrictions on password sharing in the U.S. and other countries. It was a bold move that had many wondering how the change would impact Netflix as the go-to streaming service for TV and films, and what it would mean for the rest of the subscription-based content streaming industry.See: 10 Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonFind Out: What To Do If You Owe Back Taxes to the IRSLet’s find out what experts think — along with why this move has, weirdly, worked in Netflix’s favor and what it could mean for other streaming service providers down the road.Netflix Is Addressing a Long-Term Problem — And It’s WorkingAll streaming services have been dealing with the problem of password sharing, basically since their infancy, and Netflix is no exception, but this is its first real attempt to resolve the issue.“Historically, [Netflix] refused to deal with the problem, and at times, it actively encouraged password sharing, arguing that sharing passwords actually enabled user growth,” said Dan Goman, tech streaming expert and founder and CEO of Ateliere.Interestingly, rather than scaring away prospective subscribers with its strict no password sharing policy, Netflix saw a boom in user growth.“Antenna reported that immediately after the rollout, Netflix had the ‘four single largest days of U.S. user acquisition in the four and a half years that Antenna has been measuring the streaming service’,” Goman said. “On May 26 and 27, Netflix had almost 100,000 daily new sign-ups, and little to no consumer backlash.”Stefan Lederer, the CEO and founder of Bitmovin, a startup that provides video streaming infrastructure, added that “the spike in signups shows that enough consumers were prepared to swipe their card and sign up, demonstrating the perceived strength of Netflix’s brand and content.”I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I’m Never SellingMore Subscribers Are Opting for Netflix’s Ad-Supported PlanThough subscribers are signing up for Netflix in droves, it’s worth noting that they’re still looking to save money by opting into the service’s ad-supported plan.Story continues“Almost a quarter of the new [sign-ups] were for its ad-supported plan, which was the highest portion of signups,” Lederer said. “Therefore, it would seem that the slightly cheaper, ad-supported plan has helped make Netflix more accessible and appealing for viewers who were password-sharing by offering a more cost-effective option.”Why Aren’t Other Streaming Services Doing This?Netflix’s new password-sharing crackdown has driven strong subscriber growth. So why aren’t other streaming services doing the same? The answer points, in part, to their comparative newness in the spacing.“Other competitors are not as mature and are not in a position to risk a subscriber backlash as they attempt to grow their services,” Goman said.In other words, other streaming giants and aspiring giants are still trying to generate enough traction to pull off such severe crackdowns without negative repercussions.“Secondary streaming services like Paramount+ or Disney+ may not be cracking down on password sharing….yet,” said Brian Chevalier-Jordan, CMO at National Business Capital. “They’re attempting to grow the eyeballs on their channels to maximize future advertising revenues.”But that consumers are still willing to pay for Netflix after years of essentially stealing from it could point to weaknesses among other content providers, as it suggests that Netflix is the world’s most valued subscription service.“If people view their primary viewing platform as Netflix and other services as rounding out gaps in their programming, Netflix could easily remain the king of streaming,” Chevalier-Jordan said. “As other streaming services raise their prices (see Disney+ and Amazon Prime), this could exacerbate that impact.”It’s Only a Matter of Time Before Other Streaming Companies Crackdown on Password SharingIt’s likely only a matter of time before other streaming giants embrace the same severe policy of no password sharing that Netflix has rolled out.“They’re likely going to jump on Netflix’s bandwagon in the coming years,” Chevalier-Jordan said. “Given how compliant consumers have been, they’ll want to follow Netflix’s example. The degree to which consumers comply will reveal the strength of those brands and the content it provides.”Netflix Has Ample International Content — And That Helps Amid the StrikesAnother factor playing in the dominance of Netflix right now is its ample international content, which helps it stay mighty amid the stateside strikes. Shows like “Squid Game” and “Money Heist” have been massive international hits that have Americans hooked.“Netflix’s large, growing and popular international content remains unaffected by the U.S-based strikes and will provide it with new content to feed hungry viewers, further cementing Netflix in consumers’ minds as the go-to streaming service,” Chevalier-Jordan said.What Is the Future of Streaming? In Goman’s opinion, the future of streaming mirrors the traditional cable model. This could ultimately be more expensive than the cable model.“I like to think of it as ‘Cable 2.0’,” Goman said. “Streaming services, including Netflix, will continue to increase the unsustainably low subscription prices, and we’re already at a point where subscriptions to the top streaming services cost more than the average cable bill. This leads us to Cable 2.0, where platforms like YouTube and Roku will bundle content and be the next ‘cable companies’ offering cost effective content bundles for consumers.”We’re already seeing rising prices occurring in the streaming and subscription-based space. This could cause consumers to have to choose their streaming darlings more carefully.“The overall cost of paid streaming service subscriptions is rising dramatically as nearly all of the major streaming services have increased prices over the past 18 months — some dramatically,” said Ian Morris, CEO of Likewise, the Bill Gates-backed media and entertainment platform providing personalized content recommendations and discovery for TV, movies and more. “For example, Disney has more than doubled the price of Disney+ since its launch to $13.99/month, while also bumping Hulu to $17.99. With Max and Netflix above $15 each, and newer players such as Peacock and Paramount+ both north of $11/month, it is clear that most consumers will need to make some tough choices about what services they wish to keep.”More From GOBankingRates4 Ways To Become Rich Working Less Than 5 Days a Week9 Middle-Class Money Traps That Keep You From Being Wealthy3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement5 Best Ways To Stay Safer From Identity Theft When You're OnlineThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Did You Have To Become a New Netflix Subscriber?

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings.Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible.""Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month, with ""Dune-- Part Two"" being the latest to push back its release date. Our next guest is warning of a $5 billion-plus hit to the economy as more delays pile up. Kevin Klowden, who is the Milken Institute Chief global strategist joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Kevin, great to have you here with us on this. First, perhaps, we start at the top here. When we think about the economic impact here, what is all being factored into that?Story continuesKEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but we're feeling anywhere that filming is taking place across the country and all the industries, and all the small businesses, and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible. That means trailer rentals, that means dry cleaners, that means restaurants, that means catering companies, that means construction, that means trucking, that means all sorts of different factors, and all of them are being affected right now. And even if the concentration is in LA, it's in New York, it's in Atlanta, it's in Albuquerque, it's in Pittsburgh, it's in Chicago, and in a number of different places where filming actually takes place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So, Kevin, I want to focus on that $5 billion projection. Within that, what industry or company, what will be the biggest laggard in dragging down that projection?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the biggest thing right now is it's no one company. Obviously, the majors factor in more than anything else. So Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity. So anybody who does film and TV, who does a large number of different productions-- so say Disney is a classic example of that, Warner Brothers, Universal, and even at this point, given the role they're playing, Netflix and Amazon increasingly become significant, even Apple-- they're all getting affected, but we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures. And the reason is that they can put off costs right now. The catch is that, as you were mentioning with ""Dune Part-- Two,"" is that as they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're at a time right now, Kevin-- this is Rachelle, by the way-- where obviously 65 years ago when we had a strike like this, you didn't have streaming services, you didn't have as much reality TV. So how does that really change the landscape of what we might see happen next with these negotiations and how far apart they are?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the big thing that you're dealing with right now that's different than 65 years ago is that the cost of living issue in Hollywood was not a problem 65 years ago, it certainly is now, it is in New York, it is everywhere. And that's a major driving factor, just simply being able to maintain the middle class as opposed to the studio system, which paid people a set amount on a regular basis each month. And people knew what was coming next, and they don't know, and that's the pressure everybody is facing. But the big distinction between now and say when the major strike last happened in 1960 is that it's all about where's the revenue coming from next. In 1960, the existential threat had become television, now it's about streaming. What happens next in terms of where is the streaming money coming from? Because streaming doesn't pay as well, not only for the companies but for the people working in it, as what we saw with DVD sales, what we saw with broadcast television, and so on.]"

Adams as Mike Ross and Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane in ""Suits."" (USA Network / NBCU Photo Bank / NBCUniversal )A month ago, Erica Moreali flipped through the channels on her TV and all she saw were repeats.The El Segundo-based HR consultant became hooked on ""Suits,"" a legal drama starring Meghan Markle that first ran on USA Network 12 years ago but became available on Netflix in June. She had heard about the show years ago but hadn't watched it before.""It's just a night where nothing was on TV and I went to Netflix ... and 'Suits' was there — it literally was right in my face,"" the 46-year-old said.Moreali binged several episodes that night. About a week ago, she finished the whole series, devouring all eight seasons that were available on Netflix, plus the final ninth season streaming on Amazon's Prime Video, for a total of roughly 90 hours.""Suits,"" which was produced by NBCUniversal's Universal Cable Productions (now known as Universal Content Productions), has become an unlikely sensation for Netflix. Its first two seasons landed on Netflix's top 10 most watched series in the U.S. for at least nine weeks, according to the Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming service.This summer, ""Suits,"" which is on both Netflix and Peacock (owned by NBCUniversal parent Comcast), has been the most streamed title for six consecutive weeks on U.S. television sets, with more than 20 billion viewing minutes, according to Nielsen. ""Suits"" set a viewership record for a series acquired by a streaming service, Nielsen said in a recent report.Read more: Writers' strike: What happened, how it ended and its impact on Hollywood""Suits,"" which follows a young man (played by Patrick J. Adams) who scores a job at a prestigious New York legal firm despite never attending law school, wasn't the obvious candidate to become a latter-day streaming hit.When the legal drama ran on USA Network, it didn't create the generation-defining buzz of ""Friends"" or the water cooler dominance of ""Game of Thrones."" Though a robust performer for USA, it was hardly a ratings juggernaut. In 2019, the final season averaged an audience of about 2.1 million per episode, including delayed viewing, according to Nielsen.Story continuesRead more: What makes a streaming hit? Desperate fans 'game the system' to save favorite showsBut amid the typical doldrums of the summer TV season, worsened by the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes that have shut down the bulk of production on scripted shows and films, Moreali and other consumers are turning to old hits from basic cable and broadcast television to satisfy their entertainment needs.The strikes by film and TV writers and actors, who are fighting for higher pay from streaming shows, have shut down or delayed work on future seasons of popular series including ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix and ""Severance"" on Apple TV+. New episodes of hit series like ABC's ""Abbott Elementary"" and anticipated films like Warner Bros.' ""Dune: Part Two"" and Sony's “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” have been pushed back due to the work stoppages.People spend about 13 hours consuming media a day across different formats, and ""the attention has to go somewhere,"" said Scott Purdy, U.S. national media industry leader for audit, tax and advisory services firm KPMG.When newer programs aren't available, consumers may revisit or watch older TV shows or movies for the first time.""If you had dropped a new 'Stranger Things' season or if you dropped another 'House of the Dragon,' that would be the most watched on those platforms, so I think this is the archives, the libraries, filling a gap of the new content,"" Purdy said.Other older shows have seen a recent surge in popularity as viewers seek the programming version of comfort food.They include the series ""Ugly Betty,"" which starred America Ferrera and originally aired on ABC and is available on Hulu and Netflix; and ""What Men Want,"" a 2019 romantic comedy film starring Taraji P. Henson that is available in Netflix in certain countries, although not currently in the U.S.Adam Shankman, director of ""What Men Want,"" said he was surprised when he learned how well the movie was doing on Netflix, where it placed in the top 10 English-language films in 60 countries, including Brazil, France and Iceland.""I'm just happy that people are laying eyeballs on it, because it's a silly, fun movie that was designed purely to make people laugh,"" Shankman said.The phenomenon of older, licensed titles being rediscovered by new fans on Netflix is not new. Some have deemed it the ""Netflix effect."" Shows that were once on regular, linear television could find new viewers among younger generations who never subscribed to a traditional pay-TV bundle. This was a key element of Netflix's rise to prominence, in which many viewers discovered shows like ""Breaking Bad,"" which originated on AMC Network.But why ""Suits,"" of all shows?Sometimes titles can gain popularity if there are events that spur interest in certain celebrities, such as Ferrera, who starred in the summer blockbuster “Barbie.”Aaron Korsh, creator of ""Suits,"" credits the popularity boost to interest in Markle (now the duchess of Sussex), Netflix's skill at pushing a show and a ""Suits"" scene that went viral on social media. The scene, in which a hot-shot lawyer takes a chance on a down-on-his-luck young man, has made the rounds on TikTok.""[The show] has an inherent optimism to it, and I think that's a real part of what people respond to,"" Korsh said.""Suits"" has been available on Peacock since July 2020, but demand for the show significantly picked up after it came to Netflix on June 17, according to Parrot Analytics, a data firm that tracks demand for content via consumption data, social video, search traffic, social media mentions and other metrics. Netflix has more than 238 million users compared with Peacock's 24 million paid subscribers in the second quarter, meaning more people suddenly had an opportunity to see it.Netflix put the show right in front of many viewers on their welcome screens, boosting its momentum.Some members of the Writers Guild of America have cited the ""Suits"" phenomenon as an example of why the union is striking for higher pay based on a show's success. Writers earn residuals when a show is licensed to a streaming service like Netflix but do not get more in the event that viewership skyrockets.“It would be better if we got paid more money when our viewership numbers went up,” Korsh said. “I don’t know if that means we’re going to achieve it retroactively, but I do think it is reasonable and achievable to expect residuals to go up, commensurate with increased views.”Netflix declined to comment for this article.Parrot Analytics analyst Wade Payson-Denney said he thinks ""Suits"" would have been popular on Netflix even without the strikes. Other series that started on linear television gained even bigger followings since they came to Netflix include ""You,"" ""Lucifer"" and ""Manifest.""""Netflix has so much more scale and ubiquity in the market than any of its competitors at this point,"" Payson-Denney said. ""I believe it had more to do with Netflix's scale and reach than the strikes themselves.""Part of the appeal of long-running series like ""Suits"" is that they allow viewers to become invested in the characters and story over time but don't require fans to obsessively watch every move on the screen. The enduring CBS procedural ""Criminal Minds"" and the sitcom ""Young Sheldon"" are among the shows people watch after viewing ""Suits,"" the analyst added.""It's that sort of comfort viewing, but put it in the background kind of TV,"" Payson-Denney said.Read more: 'Friends' is the gift that keeps on giving to WarnerMediaStreamers have ponied up hundreds of millions of dollars for older series from the 1990s and 2000s, such as ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld,"" that have found younger audiences online. For example, NBCUniversal paid $500 million to get the streaming rights to ""The Office"" for five years, outbidding Netflix.As the dual Hollywood strikes continue, some industry observers said streaming services with large libraries of content — such as Netflix — will have a competitive advantage compared to those that do not, as production slows down and consumers run out of new movies and TV shows to watch.Read more: The studios went public with their WGA offer. Was it a mistake?But streamers still need to produce quality content to keep drawing new customers and satisfy existing ones. Relying on oldies is not a long-term solution, analysts caution.""If this goes on too long, in a year from now, they don't have the materials to bring in the viewers and add to their subscriptions,"" said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s film school. ""Once people realized I've watched everything there is to watch, then you certainly don't renew your subscription.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

According to the Inflation Reduction Act law, they have about 30 days to provide a counteroffer if they do not agree with that offer or to accept that initial offer.If with the counteroffer that CMS doesn't agree, then we will engage in up to three negotiation meetings for that back and forth, ultimately leading to a final agreed maximum fair price that will be published on September 1, 2024. And we will also then subsequently publish a narrative about that entire negotiation process.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know that some of the companies have already filed suit trying to delay or stop the process altogether. And in their lawsuit, some have said that they're worried about what that maximum fair price is going to be, and that it could, quote, ""be as low as a penny."" And so I wonder what your thoughts are on that and if you could explain how Medicare is going about deciding what the bar is for an appropriate cost.MEENA SESHAMANI: Yes, I think we all have shared goals that we want to improve access and affordability for the innovative therapies that people need. And as we laid out in our negotiation guidance, we want to be able to look at the benefits that a drug brings to populations. Does it address an unmet need? Does it address different populations that have needs?Can we look at things like being able to live at home and not be hospitalized and to be able to incorporate all of that into an agreed upon fair price for the Medicare program for all of the people who rely on these often life-saving medications and for the American taxpayer? And so that is how we will approach this in a true back-and-forth negotiation process.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know some of the drugs that were listed caught some by surprise. Some expected Eliquis but then Stelara. I know a couple of reporters have already asked about the fact that they may be facing generic competition as well as the insulin because of that out-of-pocket cap already in place. Can you explain why some of these drugs made it, and whether or not the list could potentially change before 2026?MEENA SESHAMANI: The list of drugs that have been selected will not change. Those are the selected drugs. How we came to that selection was following the new drug law.What is written in the law, where first, we looked at the 7,500 drugs that are covered in the Part D Medicare program and looked at which ones are what are called in the law ""qualifying single source drugs,"" meaning that they are drugs that have been on the market for seven years for a drug product, 11 years for a biological product, and do not have competition.From there, again, following what is in the law, we excluded drugs with low Medicare spend, plasma-derived products, certain orphan drugs. We also got information from manufacturers for a small biotech exemption-- again, that is laid out in the law-- and then also looked at whether for biosimilar manufacturers, they could submit a request to us for a potential delay if there's a biosimilar coming on the market.Again, that is laid out in the law, and all of this is also put in detail in the guidance that we put out. Once we went through all of these criteria, we ranked and basically have the top 10 drugs in highest gross spend. So all of the drugs that are listed are ones that met all of those criteria.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Now tell me about these companies that were selected. I know that the administration chose to release this list before the opening bell. And it hasn't really seemed to make an impact on the stocks right now. Do you see that as a sign that they are not really going to be impacted negatively by these negotiations?MEENA SESHAMANI: Well, I think we know that the pharmaceutical industry is strong, and thriving, and innovates, and will continue to innovate. And in fact, the way that we have laid out as we were talking about, Anjalee, this negotiation process, it really is with an eye towards, how do we reward the innovations for the cures and therapies that people need?How can we incorporate real-world evidence for these drugs that have been out there being utilized to understand what impact they have in the real world for real people so that we can take that into consideration as we look at what a price should be for these kinds of medications? And I think that's what you're seeing.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And I know that the fines are going to be put in place for those companies that decide not to participate or who don't want to participate in the negotiation process. What then happens with this list? And what happens to those companies? Is it a fine in perpetuity, or is there an end point?MEENA SESHAMANI: Yeah, so there is an excise tax that is operated by the Treasury Department, by the IRS if a company decides not to participate in the negotiation process as you described.We laid out in the guidance where if there are ways that a company cannot have that excise tax, where they can negotiate and come to an agreed upon maximum fair price, or they can exit the Medicare and Medicaid market. And the details of that are in the guidance.In terms of the drugs, if a company does decide to come back and participate in the negotiation process, we have laid out in our guidance that we will engage. We will use the same process that we are laying out now if a company comes back at a later point.And also in the guidance, we lay out that we will continue to monitor for competition for these drugs. There are ways in which, again, laid out in the law and in our guidance where a drug that is selected may not have the negotiation if they meet certain criteria that have been laid out.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, certainly leaving that open door policy as companies are familiar with. So we'll have to leave it there, but certainly, a lot more work for you yet to do. Dr. Meena Seshamani, head of Medicare, thank you so much for joining us today.MEENA SESHAMANI: And thank you for having me.]"

The Biden administration has shared its list of ten prescription drugs that will be subject to pricing negotiations between manufacturers and Medicare. Tropical Storm Idalia has officially been upgraded to a hurricane. It's expected to make landfall on Florida's west coast on Wednesday.Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith highlights three of this morning's biggest stories.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Here are three things that you need to start your morning. Not a great quarter for Best Buy despite beating the Street. The retailer lowering its sales outlook for the year after notable declines in mobile phones, consumer electronics, and appliances. Its revenue target now stands between $43.8 billion and $44.5 billion. It also foresees a further drop in comparable sales between 4.5% and 6%. So could this be the bottom, however? That's the big question. CEO Corey Barry saying that she expects this year will be the low point in tech demand.Let the negotiations begin. The Biden administration has unveiled the list of 10 prescription drugs that will be up for price haggling between drug makers and Medicare. The list included Johnson &amp; Johnson's Xarelto used to prevent blood clotting, Merck's Januvia which is used to lower blood sugar for those with type 2 diabetes, and Amgen's Enbrel which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Now, plans are controversial with drug makers, but are a key tenet of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.And tropical storm Idalia has strengthened into a hurricane as it turns towards Florida's Gulf Coast. It is set to make landfall in the Big Bend region, bringing with it 75 mile an hour winds and the threat of flash floods as well. So around 14 million Florida residents are currently under hurricane and tropical storm warnings. And it comes as FEMA announced nearly $3 billion in funding for communities to build resiliency against extreme weather fueled by climate change.]"

(NYSE:M) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-12-26-time-put-105905427.html,1693393145,STORY,['M'],"[Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$16.59 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$12.08. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Macy's' current trading price of US$12.26 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Macy's’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's What's The Opportunity In Macy's?Great news for investors – Macy's is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 4.48x is currently well-below the industry average of 24.36x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Macy's’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Macy's?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Macy's' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 36%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since M is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on M for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy M. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Macy's, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Macy's, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide design, development, build, and integration of equipment for missile flight test demonstrations and fielding.Majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Littleton, CO.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Notably, Lockheed’s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation system, also builds strike missile as well as missile defense systems. Its major programs include Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States. The unit also designs Next Generation Interceptor, a program with the Missile Defense Agency, utilizing next generation propulsion and sensors to provide homeland missile defense.As one of the major missile makers in the United States and with such remarkable missile systems in its product portfolio, Lockheed enjoys a strong demand base in the missile defense market.

One such stock that merits attention is NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG). The stock, which is currently priced at 37.12, recorded a loss of 1.28% in a day and a 3-month increase of 10.46%. The stock's fair valuation is $57.16, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NRG. Click here to check it out. NRG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NRGThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.NRG Energy (NRG) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsThe Potential Risks of NRG EnergyHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with NRG Energy should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 1, Altman Z-score of 1.04, and a Beneish M-Score of 59.36 that exceeds -1.78, the threshold for potential earnings manipulation. These indicators suggest that NRG Energy, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. NRG Energy's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Developed by Professor Messod Beneish, the Beneish M-Score is based on eight financial variables that reflect different aspects of a company's financial performance and position. These are Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Gross Margin (GM), Total Long-term Assets Less Property, Plant and Equipment over Total Assets (TATA), change in Revenue (?REV), change in Depreciation and Amortization (?DA), change in Selling, General and Admin expenses (?SGA), change in Debt-to-Asset Ratio (?LVG), and Net Income Less Non-Operating Income and Cash Flow from Operations over Total Assets (?NOATA).NRG Energy: A Comprehensive OverviewNRG Energy is one of the largest retail energy providers in the U.S., with 5.5 million customers. Its 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home adds 1.9 million home services customers. NRG also is one of the largest U.S. independent power producers, with 13 gigawatts of coal, gas, and oil power generation capacity primarily in Texas. NRG exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity in December 2003.NRG Energy (NRG) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsAnalysis of NRG Energy's ProfitabilityFirstly, let's address profitability. One significant component of the F-Score is a positive return on assets (ROA). A closer look at NRG Energy's ROA reveals a worrying trend of negative returns. This indicates the company's inability to generate profit from its assets - a fundamental concern for any investor.Let's delve deeper into NRG Energy's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 6.67; 2022: 12.59; 2023: -6.65, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in NRG Energy.Observing the financials of NRG Energy, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-3857 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $-2055 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendNRG Energy (NRG) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsExamining NRG Energy's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.24; 2022: 1.29; 2023: 1.02, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that NRG Energy's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, NRG Energy follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 25.95; 2022: 25.45; 2023: 0.22 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that NRG Energy is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for NRG Energy, its current score suggests potential troubles.NRG Energy's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of NRG Energy's Altman Z-score reveals NRG Energy's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for NRG Energy is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in NRG Energy's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.The days sales outstanding (DSO) is an important financial metric that denotes the average time a company takes to collect payment after a sale is completed. Looking at the historical data from the past three years (2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99), there appears to be a rising trend in NRG Energy's DSO.An uptick in DSO might indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices, and in some cases, potential earnings manipulation. To explain, when DSO increases, it means the company's receivables are growing. This could be a result of sales being recorded before customers have paid, which inflates the revenue figures. In extreme cases, a company may even recognize revenue from sales that may never be collected, an action that is considered earnings manipulation. A rising DSO figure warrants scrutiny as it can signal financial distress or questionable accounting practices within the company. Therefore, investors should closely monitor such trends for early detection of any potential financial risks.The Gross Margin index tracks the evolution of a company's gross profit as a proportion of its revenue. A downward trend could indicate issues such as overproduction or more generous credit terms, both of which are potential red flags for earnings manipulation. By examining the past three years of NRG Energy's historical data (2021: 25.95; 2022: 25.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NRG Energy in FocusNRG Energy (NRG) is headquartered in Houston, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 18.17% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.38 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 4.02%. In comparison, the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield is 3.73%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.66%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 88.27%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 39%. This means it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, NRG expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.55 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 73.66%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Intel Corporation (INTC).

The company’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.In Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook. The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the Permian Basin, the most prolific resource in the United States.However, the firm’s dividend yield is lower than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Moreover, weak industry margins and lower sales from the Chemical Products business especially in the United States, are hurting the energy firm’s operations.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Home Depot have modestly outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past six months (+13.7% vs. +13.3%).

Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions, increased 2.8 percent over the prior year period.Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $31.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $24.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization, totaled $38.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $31.7 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The year-over-year increase in reported and adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to sales execution and operating margin expansion within both business segments.""Patterson had a strong start to fiscal 2024, delivering internal sales growth and enhanced profitability in the first quarter,"" said Don Zurbay, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. ""Our initiatives to drive margin improvement were successful in helping us achieve adjusted operating margin expansion across the company and the Dental and Animal Health segments. Continued execution of our proven strategy and the resilient end markets in which we operate make us well positioned to drive improved performance over the long term.""Story continuesPatterson DentalReported net sales in the Dental segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $567.3 million. Internal sales increased 2.1 percent compared to the fiscal 2023 first quarter. Internal sales of consumables increased 4.6 percent year-over-year. Excluding the deflationary impact of certain infection control products, internal sales of consumables increased 6.9 percent year-over-year. Compared to the prior year period, internal sales of equipment decreased 5.7 percent and internal sales of value-added services increased 5.8 percent.Patterson Animal HealthReported net sales in the Animal Health segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $1.01 billion. Internal sales growth of 4.0 percent year-over-year was driven by growth in both the companion animal and production animal businesses. Within the Animal Health segment, internal sales of consumables grew 3.5 percent, equipment and software decreased 3.7 percent and value-added services increased 72.3 percent.Balance Sheet and Capital AllocationDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Patterson Companies used $253.4 million of cash from operating activities and collected deferred purchase price receivables of $242.0 million, using $11.4 million in cash, compared to using $49.6 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 (see definition below and attached free cash flow table) during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 improved by $35.7 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to a decreased level of working capital during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Patterson Companies declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share and returned $25.4 million in cash dividends to shareholders. Also, under an existing share repurchase authorization, the company repurchased approximately $29.5 million of shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Patterson had approximately $380 million of share repurchase authority remaining on its current share repurchase authorization.Fiscal 2024 GuidancePatterson Companies today reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 earnings guidance, which is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted1 basis:GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.24 per diluted share.Non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share.Our non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 guidance excludes the after-tax impact of:Deal amortization expenses of approximately $29.3 million ($0.31 per diluted share).Our guidance reflects the strength of our business and competitive positioning, as well as our expectations for the North American and international end markets in which we operate, which we expect to be affected by the ongoing challenges of inflationary trends and higher interest rates as well as a potential slow-down in the broader economy. Beyond macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our guidance further assumes that there are no material adverse developments associated with wide-spread public health concerns.1Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, other income (expense), net income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization along with the related tax effect of this item.The term ""free cash flow"" used in this release is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus the collection of deferred purchase price receivables.In addition, the term ""internal sales"" used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency and the impact from recent acquisitions. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in currency rates.Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company's performance and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.First Quarter Conference Call and ReplayPatterson Companies’ fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call will start at 8:30 a.m. Eastern today.

PDCO may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Patterson Companies is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PDCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 42 cents per share for PDCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PDCO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.66% heading into earnings season.Patterson Companies, Inc.

The news was first reported by Reuters.U.S. District Judge, George Daniels, in Manhattan dismissed most of the lawsuit filed by Commerzbank, alleging that BNY Mellon was responsible for more than $1 billion in losses on toxic mortgages purchased before the 2008 global financial crisis.The judge dismissed Commerzbank’s claims on all but 13 of the 100 certificates and notes it bought. He also rejected all negligence claims against BNY Mellon, which had served as trustee.Commerzbank, in its December 2015 complaint, alleged that BNY Mellon was sitting idle even when losses piled up. Per Commerzbank, BNY Mellon should have forced lenders to buy back and servicers to address troubled loans.The securities had been issued from 72 RMBS trusts and a collateralized debt obligation backed by home loans from Countrywide, NovaStar and other lenders.While dismissing most of the lawsuit, Judge Daniels said that Commerzbank lacked standing to sue more than 76 securities because it sold them before taking legal action. Also, the company waited too long under German law to sue more than 11 other certificates.The Judge also said that recent rulings, which include a decision by New York state’s Court of Appeals, required the rejection of Commerzbank’s negligence claims because they duplicated its breach-of-contract claims.Over the past three months, shares of BNY Mellon have gained 8.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before and after the 2008 financial crisis, investors suffered huge losses on the RMBS they once considered safe. Thus, for more than a decade, various lawsuits have been filed against lenders, servicers and trustees.Notably, the trustees handle back-office work after securities are sold and ensure that investors get their payments.Trustees have been saying that their contracts safeguarded them from liability for RMBS losses and that sophisticated investors should have been aware of the risks.Nomura Holdings, Inc. NMR agreed to pay $35 million as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the federal government over criminal fraud relating to the trading of RMBS.The traders at Nomura had been accused of overstating prices of MBS, which were demanded by sellers from 2009 to 2013, and keeping the difference.Further, the traders had been held responsible for charging extra unearned commissions from their customers by negotiating prices for the bonds that NMR had already purchased.UBS Group AG UBS arrived at a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to pay $1.44 billion as a penalty to resolve a long-running civil case. The civil action against UBS was filed in 2018, alleging misconduct with regard to the underwriting, issuance and sale of RMBS that were issued in 2006-2007.UBS said that the entire settlement was provisioned in the prior periods.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data released today for June 2023 show all 20 major metro markets reported month-over-month price increases for the fourth straight month. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported 0.0% annual change in June, up from a loss of -0.4% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed a decrease of -0.5%, which is an improvement on the -1.1% decrease in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year loss of -1.2%, up from -1.7% in the previous month.Chicago, Cleveland, and New York again led the way reporting the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in June. Chicago remained in the top spot with a 4.2% year-over-year price increase, with Cleveland in at number two with a 4.1% increase, and New York held down the third spot with a 3.4% increase. There again was an even split of 10 cities reporting lower prices and those reporting higher prices in the year ending June 2023 versus the year ending May 2023; 13 cities showed price acceleration relative to the previous month.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a 0.9% month-over-month increase in June, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites also posted like increases of 0.9%.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month increase of 0.7%, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted increases of 0.9%.ANALYSIS""U.S. home prices continued to increase in June 2023,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI.  ""Our National Composite rose by 0.9% in June, and it now stands only -0.02% below its all-time peak from exactly one year ago.  Our 10- and 20-City Composites likewise each gained 0.9% in June 2023, and stand -0.5% and -1.2%, respectively, below their June 2022 peaks.Story continues""As we've noted previously, the recovery in home prices is broadly based.  Prices rose in all 20 cities in June, both before and after seasonal adjustment.  Over the last 12 months, 10 cities show positive returns.  Otherwise said, half the cities in our sample now sit at all-time high prices.""Regional differences continue to be striking.  On a year-over-year basis, June's three best-performing cities were Chicago (+4.2%), Cleveland (+4.1%), and New York (+3.4%) – the same three that had topped our May leader board.  At the other end of the scale, the worst performers continue to be in the Pacific and Mountain time zones, with San Francisco (-9.7%) and Seattle (-8.8%) at the bottom.  The Midwest (+2.8%) continues as the nation's strongest region, followed this month by the Northeast (+1.6%).  The West (-5.9%) remains the weakest region.""June is the fifth consecutive month in which home prices have increased across the U.S.  With 2023 half over, the National Composite has risen 4.7%, which is slightly above the median full calendar year increase in more than 35 years of data.  We recognize that the market's gains could be truncated by increases in mortgage rates or by general economic weakness, but the breadth and strength of this month's report are consistent with an optimistic view of future results.""Table 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak (%)LevelFrom Trough (%)From Peak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %308.25130.0 %67.0 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %314.86134.8 %52.5 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %328.63124.4 %45.2 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for June 2023.

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide design, development, build, and integration of equipment for missile flight test demonstrations and fielding.Majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Littleton, CO.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Notably, Lockheed’s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation system, also builds strike missile as well as missile defense systems. Its major programs include Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.

Click here to check it out. LMT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LMTLockheed Martin is the world's largest defense contractor, dominating the Western market for high-end fighter aircraft since it won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in 2001. The company's largest segment, aeronautics, generates over two-thirds of its revenue from the F-35. The remaining segments include the rotary and mission systems (mainly the Sikorsky helicopter business), missiles and fire control (missiles and missile defense systems), and space systems (satellites and equity income from the United Launch Alliance joint venture).Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT): A Detailed Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from our unique valuation method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at, considering historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Our analysis indicates that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's fair value, as estimated by the GF Value, is based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. At its current price of $445.65 per share, Lockheed Martin has a market cap of $112.20 billion, and the stock seems to be fairly valued.Story continuesSince Lockheed Martin is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT): A Detailed Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Lockheed Martin has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.21, which ranks worse than 70.93% of 289 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Lockheed Martin's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT): A Detailed Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Lockheed Martin has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $67.40 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $27.35. Its operating margin is 12.86%, which ranks better than 78.09% of 283 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Lockheed Martin at 9 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Lockheed Martin is 5.8%, which ranks better than 62.84% of 261 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 0.9%, which ranks worse than 50.66% of 227 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Lockheed Martin's ROIC was 16.26, while its WACC came in at 6.04.Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT): A Detailed Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 50.66% of 227 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.

140,6399f50a-e496-3ce4-b9c5-9bb0a1cee024,PHM,2023-08-30,5 Top-Ranked Stocks to Buy From the Buoyant Homebuilding Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-ranked-stocks-buy-134500059.html,1693316700,STORY,"['MDC', 'TOL', 'MTH', 'PHM', '^GSPC', 'TMHC']","[The U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, rising raw material and labor costs. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, Meritage Homes Corporation MTH and M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities. The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties, residential real estate, and oil and gas assets.4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureLack of Supply, Suburban Shift: There is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders.Meanwhile, the changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence. Demand for new homes is improving in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which, in turn, is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues and profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. On Jul 26, 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% while leaving its options open on future rate hikes. The central bank's move pushed its benchmark policy rate, the Fed funds rate, to a new range of 5.25%-5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Notably, as part of the Fed’s rate hiking drive since the 1980s, the U.S. central bank has lifted the range for its benchmark interest rate by 5.25 percentage points since March 2022. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Story continues Tight Labor &amp; Credit Markets: Although there has been a modest improvement in the supply chain and some easing in labor constraints, supply-chain challenges are still expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times to some extent in the near term. Continuous supply-chain issues in various countries have been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time. Again, the shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America’s economy. Meanwhile, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #4, which places it in the top 2% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since May 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased 20% and 20.1%, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader Zacks Construction sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has gained 60% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s rise of 10.5%. The broader sector has gained 30.7% over the time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is commonly used for valuing homebuilding stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.3 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.1 and the sector’s 14.5.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 11.6X and as low as 4.2X, with a median of 8.8X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5005 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy NowWe have selected five stocks from the Zacks homebuilding space that currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are expected to register growth.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Toll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, Toll Brothers is a leading builder of luxury homes. The company has been benefiting from its strategy of broadening its product lines, price points and geographies. Also, it has been gaining from the lack of competition in the luxury new home market, its build-to-order approach and solid backlog level. This, combined with its focus on operational efficiency, has been helping TOL to drive growth. Meanwhile, the company has been strategically adding more affordable luxury communities because of the current demographic trends and expanding footprint and customer base. These communities are expected to be more capital efficient.Toll Brothers stock gained 54.4% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s 38.6% rise. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have increased to $11.59 per share from $10.61 over the past seven days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 31.4%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A. This helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.Price and Consensus: TOLPulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, this homebuilder has been benefiting from a prudent land investment strategy, focus on entry-level buyers and return of more free cash flow to shareholders. PulteGroup’s annual land acquisition strategies have been resulting in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. Its solid operating model, which strategically aligns the production of build-to-order and quick-move-in homes with applicable demand across consumer groups, has been a major tailwind.PulteGroup stock has jumped 90.4% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 and 2024 earnings has been upwardly revised by 12.3% and 9%, respectively, over the past 30 days. Its earnings topped consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, with the average surprise being 19.5%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A.Price and Consensus: PHMMeritage Homes: Based in Scottsdale, AZ, Meritage Homes is one of the leading designers and builders of single-family homes. Its focus on entry-level LiVE.NOW homes has been a major driving factor. Although the combined effect of greater sales incentives and continued elevated direct costs has been impacting the company’s gross margins, MTH is particularly focused on increasing gross margins and maximizing profits on every sale. To this end, it is making homes out of speculations that promise faster delivery at a lower cost. Meritage Homes’ strategic shift to a pure-play entry-level and first-move-up builder is expected to yield higher absorptions, aided by an improving community count growth trajectory.Meritage Homes’ shares gained 65.5% so far this year. MTH has seen an upward estimate revision for 2023 and 2024 earnings by 25.2% and 22.6% over the past 30 days, respectively. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 24.1%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of B.Price and Consensus: MTH M.D.C. Holdings: Headquartered in Denver, CO, this company’s homebuilding operations include purchasing finished lots or developing lots for the construction and sale of primarily single-family detached homes to first-time and first-time move-up homebuyers under the Richmond American Homes name. In a bid to stay competitive in the current market condition, MDC is offering great opportunities for build-to-order buyers, such as long-term interest rate lock programs and other special incentives. The company’s land acquisition strategies and high liquidity add to its growth.MDC — a Zacks Rank #1 stock — has jumped 40.4% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 and 2024 earnings has been upwardly revised by 33.4% and 30.4%, respectively, over the past 30 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on other two occasions, the average surprise being 46%. Again, it carries an impressive VGM Score of A.Price and Consensus: MDCTaylor Morrison Home: This Scottsdale, AZ-based homebuilder and land developer is engaged in building single-family detached and attached homes for first-time buyers, move-up families to luxury and active adult customers. The company has been benefiting from critical advantages by achieving greater scale, simplifying its operations and embracing innovation to drive both growth opportunities and enhance bottom-line growth. Focus on the operational efficiencies and solid liquidity level are tailwinds.TMHC shares gained 72.4% so far this year.

Additionally, Johnson &amp; Johnson maintains a 9.5% stake in Kenvue common stock, which provides the Company the opportunity to monetize the retained stake in a tax efficient manner in the next year, subject to a current 90-day lockup agreement. Johnson &amp; Johnson is under no obligation to do so if market conditions are not supportive.The Company will maintain its quarterly dividend of $1.19 per share.WEBINAR INFORMATION:Johnson &amp; Johnson has published a recorded webinar for investors to provide additional context behind the updated financials and 2023 guidance found in this release.

(NYSE:RSG) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 13th of October to $0.535. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.5%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Republic Services Republic Services' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, prior to this announcement, Republic Services' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 31.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendRepublic Services Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.94 total annually to $2.14. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.6% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 4.0% per year. If Republic Services is struggling to find viable investments, it always has the option to increase its payout ratio to pay more to shareholders.We Really Like Republic Services' DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Republic Services is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Republic Services that investors should take into consideration.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.Global equities were poised to conclude August with their poorest monthly performance in 2023 thus far, reported Reuters. The MSCI's broad index of worldwide shares, represented by (.MIWD00000PUS), increased by 0.2%. This positive trend aligned with Asia's markets benefiting from China's efforts to boost its struggling stock market and weak U.S. job data released on Tuesday, which suggested that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. European shares (.STOXX) also gained modestly on Wednesday, and the measure of Asian shares (.MIAPJ0000PUS) went up by 0.35%. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei (.N225), reached its highest point in over two weeks. Wall Street also joined the optimistic trend, as all three major stock indexes surged on Tuesday. Notably, the data on U.S. job openings for July showed the lowest level in almost two and a half years. This drop indicated that the tight job market was easing inflation pressures and that companies were adjusting their strategies ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting scheduled for September 19.European bond markets experienced a decline in response to recent German inflation data, contributing to a fluctuating market environment on August 30. Alongside this, stocks and US equity futures faced challenges, and Treasury yields underwent a minor dip. The release of economic data from the US led to a reduction in expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in 2023. Notably, European bonds showed a slip in value, indicating that inflation might not fully retreat in the eurozone. The 10-year yield in Germany surged by as much as five basis points, reaching 2.56%, prompted by the consumer price index's rise in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant indicator. Further reports unveiled an uptick in prices in two other states, even as inflation subsided in two regions. This trend also extended to Spain, where inflation also accelerated. The interconnectedness of these factors underscores the intricate dynamics at play in the global economic landscape, affecting various financial instruments and markets.Story continuesOil prices have slightly increased on August 30, reaching their highest point in over a week, as traders anticipate forthcoming data that could reveal a significant reduction in US oil inventories. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has experienced a fifth consecutive day of gains, nearing the $82 per barrel mark. This streak of gains is the longest since March. Notably, commercial inventories in the US declined by a substantial 11.5 million barrels, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry-funded organization. If this reduction is confirmed by official data expected later on August 30, it would mark the sixth decrease in inventories over the past seven weeks. These developments underscore the ongoing market focus on inventory levels, which can have notable implications for oil prices and market sentiment.Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), and NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street analysts.

In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”06.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Verizon gains on Citi upgradeVerizon Communications (NYSE: NYSE:VZ) shares rose more than 3% yesterday after Citi upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $40.00 from $39.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.The bank noted that the competitive environment in the wireless industry is showing signs of stabilization, which should contribute to improved operational performance.“We see a few factors that point towards a stabilizing wireless competitive landscape. Cable share gains have not been a zero-sum game,” stated Citi, highlighting the recent targeted pricing increases and longer device holding periods, which contribute to reducing upgrade costs and stabilizing churn.According to Citi, better forward FCF is expected to help lower net debt leverage and support high dividend yields.NextEra Energy surges following Raymond James upgradeNextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) shares surged more than 4% yesterday after Raymond James upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $60.00.The key driver behind the upgrade is the company's current dividend yield of 7.0%, which is notably higher than the 10-year Treasury yield by 290 basis points. This substantial spread is wider than the long-term median of 170 basis points.""Only once during NEP’s decade-long history as a public company did this spread ever surpass 300 bp, and only briefly – this was, in fact, during the initial COVID crisis. We are mindful that the macro interest rate environment may continue to pressure all rate-sensitive equities, but this stock is not priced for perfection.""Two more upgradesWells Fargo upgraded Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) to Equal Weight from Underweight and raised its price target to $317.00 from $290.00.Story continuesDA Davidson upgraded The First Bancshares (NASDAQ:FBMS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $34.00.""The bank boasts solid defensive characteristics, including favorable comps vs. peers on funding and liquidity, while capital and credit quality remain solid.

The upsurge in passenger volumes makes the UAL stock an attractive investment opportunity currently.Let’s delve deep to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has been revised 14.5% and 16.5% upward over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.Given the wealth of information at brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.Buoyant Air-Travel Demand &amp; Other Tailwinds: Improvement in air-travel demand bodes well for UAL. Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, have been very strong with people taking to the skies again. Recently, management lifted earnings per share forecast for 2023, primarily driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario. UAL's efforts to upgrade its fleet are commendable as well. In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing in December 2022. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more.The new jets are expected to result in 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be replaced. As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians among others are also likely to be created.In response to the improved demand, United Airlines widened the scope of its code-sharing partnership with Azul AZUL. Under the expanded deal, passengers can fly to six new destinations after connecting from the designated Brazilian airports to Orlando or Fort Lauderdale on UAL flights. The six new destinations are Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. The customer-friendly move will allow them to travel using a single ticket for both UAL and Azul-operated flights. The expanded partnership between the two airline companies was built on their existing codeshare routes from Houston and Newark.Story continuesImpressive Price Performance: Driven by the uptick in demand, shares of UAL have gained 30.5% year to date compared with its industry’s growth of 12.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which UAL belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the company in the top 30% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.In fact, an ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY and SkyWest SKYW. While Ryanair sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present, SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ryanair Holdings’ growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat in air-travel-demand scenario. An uptick in passenger volumes is leading the company to post impressive traffic numbers over the past few months.Measures for expanding its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant air-traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 31.7% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%.SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. A fall in operating expenses due to a decline in fuel costs is another tailwind for the company.SkyWest’s environment-friendly approach also bodes well. SKYW shares have surged 154% year to date. SKYW surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters (missing once). The average beat is 31.5%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, per reports, Boeing is resuming sales of its 737 Max to China, with China Southern Airlines Co., the country’s largest carrier, poised to take the first aircraft soon.In June 2023, Boeing and China Airlines had also finalized an order for eight 787-9 Dreamliners at the Paris Air Show. The Taiwan-based China Airlines became the newest 787-10 customer, as it intended to convert six 787-9s to the 787-10, the largest member of the 787 family. Boeing has been making rapid strides in the region.These developments have followed the significant lifting of a ban on the 737 Max by Chinese officials earlier this year. The ban was in place since March 2019 following a couple of fatal Max crashes. However, it now seems China and its neighborhood is a reinvigorated market, if not new, for the planemaking major to operate in.Boeing has very recently appointed Alvin Liu as its China head of operations. “I am honored and excited for the opportunity to help expand on the incredible, 50-plus-year foundation of success and partnership that Boeing has built in China,” Liu said in a release. “Nearly 8,500 new airplanes, and $550 billion in commercial services, will be needed over the next 20 years in China and I am committed to making sure our team is ready to support our customers and meet that demand.”Boeing is part of the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry. Since the beginning of the year, this planemaker’s stock has gained 19.2% compared to the industry’s 10.4% decline. However, the price has been on a steady fall since July after the issues with its supplier and the manufacturing defect on the 737 Max came to light. Prices shot up again once the developments from China were reported.Story continuesFor the current year, its estimated earnings growth is 82.1%. For 2024, it is projected at 350.7%. Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing has been having a steady year with China opening up and international travel picking up.

Along the way, you’ll pick up some passive income, basically enabling you to have your cake and eat it, too. If you’re ready to gamble the responsible way, below are oversold high-yield stocks to add to your portfolio.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) draws my interest because of its acquisition of Allergan. With the buyout, AbbVie now controls Botox, which is an injection that purportedly improves appearance by relaxing the muscles that cause wrinkles. Fundamentally, as Millennials and Generation Z age and get their wrinkles, the social-media-crazed demographics should bolster demand for Botox. I see it as a long-term win-win.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRight now, though, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. Instead, ABBV slipped nearly 9%. However, it’s up about 7% in the trailing year. Thus, it demonstrates the potential for recovering against red ink. Still, the near-term choppiness has presented a discounted opportunity for those seeking oversold high-yield stocks.Specifically, AbbVie features a forward yield of 3.99%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, the payout ratio comes in at 53.46%, which while somewhat elevated is well within reason considering the passive income. Finally, AbbVie commands 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it an attractive idea.Story continuesMorgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWith so much attention paid to the financial sector – and not in a particularly encouraging way – targeting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as one of the oversold high-yield stocks to buy might initially seem excessively risky. Even with the major indices gaining relatively robustly this year, MS finds itself below parity by over 3%. Worse yet, over the trailing one-year period, shares slipped 6%.However, Morgan Stanley might be worth a look because it’s one of the biggest financial institutions. At the time of writing, the company carries a market capitalization of $137.5 billion. More importantly, Morgan Stanley posted holistic revenue growth in its second quarter. In other words, the firm posted year-over-year increases in interest and non-interest income.Regarding passive income, the financial giant carries a forward yield of 4.1%. That’s noticeably higher than the financial sector’s average yield of 3.18%. Also, the payout ratio sits around the sweet spot at 46.34%, meaning investors should have confidence in yield sustainability.Southern Company (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is a gas and electric utility holding firm. One of the main reasons why I like Southern, and enterprises in its field, is the natural monopoly concept. Basically, would-be competitors don’t even bother displacing utility giants because of the gargantuan barriers to entry. It’s a cynical idea, but that’s what drives SO as one of the top high-yield stocks.Despite its practically permanent relevance, Southern hasn’t attracted much positive attention recently. Since the Jan. opener, SO is down nearly 6%. And over the trailing 365 days, shares slipped slightly over 14%. However, this is probably a blip on the radar, again because of the extraordinary relevance. Plus, you’re dealing with a market cap of nearly $74 billion.While you’re waiting for the narrative to shift, Southern provides a forward yield of 4.13%. This comes in higher than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. To be fair, the payout ratio is a bit toasty at 69.54%. Still, with 22 consecutive years of dividend increases, it’s a status management won’t want to give up on.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comEasily ranking among the most controversial ideas for high-yield stocks to buy, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) isn’t exactly having a great time right now. Earlier, the company helped normalize social trends by forwarding a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Today, it’s basically persona non grata, especially with fears of Covid-19 falling into the toilet. Subsequently, PFE shares fell a worrying 28% since the Jan. opener.Now, I suppose that contrarians could view PFE as a discount. On paper, PFE trades at 9.8x trailing earnings. Granted, critics may state that Pfizer may be a value trap. However, over the long run, I believe the company can leverage the lessons learned from the virus to forward advanced therapeutics for a myriad of other diseases.In the meantime, investors can bank on the passive income. Currently, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.45%, well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, PFE’s payout ratio comes in at 49.14%, within an acceptable range. Also, with 12 years of consecutive dividend increases, management will want to keep the trend going.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVA classic example of oversold high-yield stocks to buy in my opinion, legacy technology stalwart IBM (NYSE:IBM) deserves a closer look. Yes, I get it. For all the underlying relevancies, IBM has shown little promise in the charts. Since the start of the year, shares sit at a hair below parity. Granted, it’s not a horrific decline by any stretch of the imagination. Still, it’s awfully disappointing compared to Big Blue’s tech peers.However, IBM offers a legitimate discount. Priced at 14.89x forward earnings, this stat compares favorably to the sector median of 25.77x. Also, IBM doesn’t get the attention it deserves, not only for its development of artificial intelligence but also for leveraging said AI for practical applications. It’s up 5% in the trailing year but it could go so much higher.Still, that only means a great discount for those seeking high-yield stocks. Right now, IBM carries a forward yield of 4.69%, well above the sector average of 1.37%. While the payout ratio is a bit lofty at 65.88%, it also commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Philip Morris (PM)Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockA controversial idea for oversold high-yield stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of the world’s biggest tobacco firms. Of course, the underlying business may offend certain sensibilities. And on the surface level, PM doesn’t seem a bright idea. After all, research points to a global decline in smoking prevalence for both men and women. So, PM losing 7% of market value since the Jan. opener seems understandable.However, available data indicates that these smokers didn’t just go cold turkey. Instead, sales of vaporizers or e-cigarettes (for you vaping aficionados, I don’t want to get into the whole sub-ohm versus above-ohm distinction) have increased. Thus, Philip Morris enjoys a large addressable market with its alternative smoking products, making its 7% year-to-date loss palatable.Even better, those who aren’t put off by the underlying business can enjoy a forward yield of 5.4%. While the payout ratio is high at 73.89%, the company commands 14 years of consecutive dividend increases.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comWhile the hydrocarbon energy sector suffered amid the Federal Reserve’s hawkish efforts to curb inflation, the sector has made a comeback in recent sessions. However, the combination of social normalization trends and supply constraint concerns haven’t exactly helped Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI). As a midstream specialist focusing on energy storage and transportation, Kinder presently doesn’t enjoy downwind benefits. Over time, I believe it will.Essentially, the company represents a critical cog in the broader energy infrastructure network. Further, as people and enterprises make their way out of the pandemic-fueled norms, we may see an increase in consumption. Plus, because consumers are holding onto their combustion vehicles for longer than ever, this framework spells good tidings for KMI.Looking to the passive income category, Kinder features a forward yield of 6.55%. That’s significantly higher than the energy sector’s average yield of 4.24%. Still, it’s a risky idea among oversold high-yield stocks in that the payout ratio is 95.83%. if you’re willing to accept it, KMI could be fundamentally intriguing.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

174,216684e0-9238-3ba9-94ee-031bdbb8710b,CI,2023-08-30,5 HMO Stocks to Watch Amid Growing Premiums & Membership,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hmo-stocks-watch-amid-150600746.html,1693321560,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CI', 'UNH', 'MOH', 'HUM', 'CNC']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly called Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to benefit from growing membership that gives rise to a steady flow of premiums. Contract wins from federal or state authorities expand geographic presence and fetch premiums to the industry participants. An aging population may sustain solid demand for health insurers’ Medicare plans. An active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy enables them to bolster capabilities. Technology advancements are meant to boost operational efficiencies. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Influencing the HMO Industry's Fate Expanding Customer Base: Industry players distribute cost-effective health insurance plans across different U.S. communities and make efforts to upgrade such plan offerings from time to time. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. This, in turn, results in growing membership, and the resultant benefit emerges in the form of improved premiums, the most significant contributor to a health insurer’s top line. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to millions of elective procedures being deferred. UnitedHealth Group official's announcement of their expected resumption is a cause of concern for health insurers. An increase in elective surgeries implies elevated medical costs for health insurers, which they must bear by exhausting premiums. However, the solid financial position and diversified operations empower industry participants to counter such headwinds.Story continuesAn Aging U.S. Population: The Medicare plans, primarily intended for people aged 65 or above, are administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The demand for such plans is expected to remain solid in the days ahead, considering the rising aging population throughout the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the period between 2010 and 2020 registered the fastest population growth in the age group of 65 years and above since 1880-1890. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. The industry participants can capitalize on the diversified health needs of a medically vulnerable population through their vast array of Medicare plans or even opening senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services.Pursuit of M&amp;A Strategy: Players in the HMO industry resort to an M&amp;A strategy that aims to enhance capabilities, expand their global presence and widen their customer base. The primary aim behind these deals is to enhance the quality of care and bring diversification benefits, enabling it to attain a competitive edge over industry peers. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation suggest higher borrowing costs, creating a headwind for the industry participants to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals.Technological Advancements: Health insurers pursue significant technology investments to stay up-to-date with the ongoing trend to go digital, showing no mood for slowing down. One such investment relates to devising virtual healthcare solutions, more commonly referred to as telehealth services that individuals can opt for within the comfort of their homes. These services render seamless delivery of healthcare services and are cost-effective. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, the telehealth services continue to fetch a steady revenue stream, boost operational efficiencies and drive margins in the long term.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #48, which places it at the top 20% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Before we present a few stocks you may want to buy or retain in your portfolio, let’s look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but fell short of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past six months.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 2.8% compared with the Medical sector’s rally of 1.4%.

Molina Healthcare: This California-based health insurer gains on improved premium revenues and a growing customer base, resulting from well-devised Medicare and Medicaid plans.

This August, the Zacks Rank #2 company received a Medicaid contract from the New Mexico Human Services Department. MOH also resorts to acquisitions to solidify and expand the geographical presence of the business. Contract wins and numerous acquisitions make management optimistic about achieving long-term premium revenue growth in the 13-15% range.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molina Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $20.66 per share, indicating a 15.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $33.1 billion, which hints at a 3.4% improvement from the year-ago actual.

This Zacks Rank #3 health insurer continues to benefit from a well-performing Government business, which is driven by continuous product expansions, rising membership and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. CI places intensified focus on launching cost-effective Medicare Advantage plans, which come with several bundled benefits and improved care coordination. The financial strength can be leveraged to undertake uninterrupted growth-related initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.80 per share, implying 6.6% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $191.6 billion, suggesting a 6.1% improvement from the year-ago actual.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, OSI Systems is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that OSIS likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TEL has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.OSIS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.19, while TEL has a forward P/E of 19.38. We also note that OSIS has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TEL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for OSIS is its P/B ratio of 3.09. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TEL has a P/B of 3.59.Based on these metrics and many more, OSIS holds a Value grade of B, while TEL has a Value grade of C.Story continuesOSIS sticks out from TEL in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that OSIS is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide design, development, build, and integration of equipment for missile flight test demonstrations and fielding.Majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Littleton, CO.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Notably, Lockheed’s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation system, also builds strike missile as well as missile defense systems.

The Center for Medicare Director Dr. Meena Seshamani tells Yahoo Finance Live that they are looking at ""the benefits that a drug brings to populations. Does it address an unmet need? Does it address different populations that have needs?"" When it comes to why some drugs were chosen Dr. Seshamani says the organization followed the criteria written in the Inflation Reduction Act, adding that the list will not change.These are the ten drugs Medicare will be negotiating the prices of:Eliquis- Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Pfizer (PFE)Jardiance- Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly (LLY)Xarelto- Bayer (BAYRY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Januvia- Merck (MRK)Farxiga- AstraZeneca (AZN)Entresto- Novartis (NVS)Enbrel- Amgen (AMGN)Imbruvica- Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV)Stelara- Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Fiasp, NovoLog- Novo Nordisk (NVO)Video TranscriptANJALEE KHEMLANI: And here to discuss all of it with me is Dr. Meena Seshamani, head of Medicare. Dr. Seshamani, a really active morning for you, I'm sure, a lot going on in the discussions around what happens next and the drugs that were, in fact, selected. So let's start off with the what happens next. You have a little bit of a breather between now and when negotiations start. Talk to us about what's going to happen. What are the next steps?MEENA SESHAMANI: Absolutely. And thanks for having me, Anjalee. So today, we released the 10 drugs that have been selected for negotiation. The next step is on October 1. The manufacturers can decide whether they want to participate in the negotiation process. October 2 is when we will get data that we will use for this negotiation.We will then engage, have patient-focused listening sessions for each of the 10 drugs, meet with each of the manufacturers, and then enter the negotiation process with an initial offer. All of this is laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act law and in the guidance that we put out.Story continuesSo on February 1, we will put out our initial offer to the manufacturers. According to the Inflation Reduction Act law, they have about 30 days to provide a counteroffer if they do not agree with that offer or to accept that initial offer.If with the counteroffer that CMS doesn't agree, then we will engage in up to three negotiation meetings for that back and forth, ultimately leading to a final agreed maximum fair price that will be published on September 1, 2024. And we will also then subsequently publish a narrative about that entire negotiation process.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know that some of the companies have already filed suit trying to delay or stop the process altogether. And in their lawsuit, some have said that they're worried about what that maximum fair price is going to be, and that it could, quote, ""be as low as a penny."" And so I wonder what your thoughts are on that and if you could explain how Medicare is going about deciding what the bar is for an appropriate cost.MEENA SESHAMANI: Yes, I think we all have shared goals that we want to improve access and affordability for the innovative therapies that people need. And as we laid out in our negotiation guidance, we want to be able to look at the benefits that a drug brings to populations. Does it address an unmet need? Does it address different populations that have needs?Can we look at things like being able to live at home and not be hospitalized and to be able to incorporate all of that into an agreed upon fair price for the Medicare program for all of the people who rely on these often life-saving medications and for the American taxpayer? And so that is how we will approach this in a true back-and-forth negotiation process.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: I know some of the drugs that were listed caught some by surprise. Some expected Eliquis but then Stelara. I know a couple of reporters have already asked about the fact that they may be facing generic competition as well as the insulin because of that out-of-pocket cap already in place. Can you explain why some of these drugs made it, and whether or not the list could potentially change before 2026?MEENA SESHAMANI: The list of drugs that have been selected will not change. Those are the selected drugs. How we came to that selection was following the new drug law.What is written in the law, where first, we looked at the 7,500 drugs that are covered in the Part D Medicare program and looked at which ones are what are called in the law ""qualifying single source drugs,"" meaning that they are drugs that have been on the market for seven years for a drug product, 11 years for a biological product, and do not have competition.From there, again, following what is in the law, we excluded drugs with low Medicare spend, plasma-derived products, certain orphan drugs. We also got information from manufacturers for a small biotech exemption-- again, that is laid out in the law-- and then also looked at whether for biosimilar manufacturers, they could submit a request to us for a potential delay if there's a biosimilar coming on the market.Again, that is laid out in the law, and all of this is also put in detail in the guidance that we put out. Once we went through all of these criteria, we ranked and basically have the top 10 drugs in highest gross spend. So all of the drugs that are listed are ones that met all of those criteria.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Now tell me about these companies that were selected. I know that the administration chose to release this list before the opening bell. And it hasn't really seemed to make an impact on the stocks right now. Do you see that as a sign that they are not really going to be impacted negatively by these negotiations?MEENA SESHAMANI: Well, I think we know that the pharmaceutical industry is strong, and thriving, and innovates, and will continue to innovate. And in fact, the way that we have laid out as we were talking about, Anjalee, this negotiation process, it really is with an eye towards, how do we reward the innovations for the cures and therapies that people need?How can we incorporate real-world evidence for these drugs that have been out there being utilized to understand what impact they have in the real world for real people so that we can take that into consideration as we look at what a price should be for these kinds of medications? And I think that's what you're seeing.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And I know that the fines are going to be put in place for those companies that decide not to participate or who don't want to participate in the negotiation process. What then happens with this list? And what happens to those companies? Is it a fine in perpetuity, or is there an end point?MEENA SESHAMANI: Yeah, so there is an excise tax that is operated by the Treasury Department, by the IRS if a company decides not to participate in the negotiation process as you described.We laid out in the guidance where if there are ways that a company cannot have that excise tax, where they can negotiate and come to an agreed upon maximum fair price, or they can exit the Medicare and Medicaid market. And the details of that are in the guidance.In terms of the drugs, if a company does decide to come back and participate in the negotiation process, we have laid out in our guidance that we will engage. We will use the same process that we are laying out now if a company comes back at a later point.And also in the guidance, we lay out that we will continue to monitor for competition for these drugs. There are ways in which, again, laid out in the law and in our guidance where a drug that is selected may not have the negotiation if they meet certain criteria that have been laid out.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, certainly leaving that open door policy as companies are familiar with. So we'll have to leave it there, but certainly, a lot more work for you yet to do. Dr. Meena Seshamani, head of Medicare, thank you so much for joining us today.MEENA SESHAMANI: And thank you for having me.]"

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings.Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible.""Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month, with ""Dune-- Part Two"" being the latest to push back its release date. Our next guest is warning of a $5 billion-plus hit to the economy as more delays pile up. Kevin Klowden, who is the Milken Institute Chief global strategist joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Kevin, great to have you here with us on this. First, perhaps, we start at the top here. When we think about the economic impact here, what is all being factored into that?Story continuesKEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but we're feeling anywhere that filming is taking place across the country and all the industries, and all the small businesses, and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible. That means trailer rentals, that means dry cleaners, that means restaurants, that means catering companies, that means construction, that means trucking, that means all sorts of different factors, and all of them are being affected right now. And even if the concentration is in LA, it's in New York, it's in Atlanta, it's in Albuquerque, it's in Pittsburgh, it's in Chicago, and in a number of different places where filming actually takes place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So, Kevin, I want to focus on that $5 billion projection. Within that, what industry or company, what will be the biggest laggard in dragging down that projection?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the biggest thing right now is it's no one company. Obviously, the majors factor in more than anything else. So Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity. So anybody who does film and TV, who does a large number of different productions-- so say Disney is a classic example of that, Warner Brothers, Universal, and even at this point, given the role they're playing, Netflix and Amazon increasingly become significant, even Apple-- they're all getting affected, but we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures. And the reason is that they can put off costs right now. The catch is that, as you were mentioning with ""Dune Part-- Two,"" is that as they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're at a time right now, Kevin-- this is Rachelle, by the way-- where obviously 65 years ago when we had a strike like this, you didn't have streaming services, you didn't have as much reality TV. So how does that really change the landscape of what we might see happen next with these negotiations and how far apart they are?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the big thing that you're dealing with right now that's different than 65 years ago is that the cost of living issue in Hollywood was not a problem 65 years ago, it certainly is now, it is in New York, it is everywhere. And that's a major driving factor, just simply being able to maintain the middle class as opposed to the studio system, which paid people a set amount on a regular basis each month. And people knew what was coming next, and they don't know, and that's the pressure everybody is facing. But the big distinction between now and say when the major strike last happened in 1960 is that it's all about where's the revenue coming from next. In 1960, the existential threat had become television, now it's about streaming. What happens next in terms of where is the streaming money coming from? Because streaming doesn't pay as well, not only for the companies but for the people working in it, as what we saw with DVD sales, what we saw with broadcast television, and so on.]"

This space is likely to remain rangebound in the near future. At present, cryptocurrencies are suffering from both positive and negative factors of equal weight. These factors are unlikely to allow this space to tilt toward any specific direction.Positive FactorsThe largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)-led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies.The latest addition to this league is PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), which has become the first major U.S. fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin known as PayPal USD.U.S. banks are currently under rating watch. Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Fitch Ratings warned that it might downgrade the ratings of more than a dozen U.S. heavyweight banks in the near future.Moreover, S&amp;P Global cut credit ratings on some regional lenders with high commercial real estate exposure. Cryptocurrencies are generally recognized as an alternative to the banking sector. Therefore, the banking sector turmoil is likely to boost cryptocurrencies.Finally, the blockbuster second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results of NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) — the leading generative AI-based chipset developer — has provided a boost to the crypto space. This is because its graphic processing units are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.Negative FactorsOn Aug 25, at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the inflation rate remains highly elevated despite steady progress in the past year. Consequently, the central bank is open for more hikes in the interest rate in the near future.Story continuesAccording to Powell, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”Higher interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The debacle of the crypto market in 2022 was the result of the central bank’s aggressive rate hike and tight monetary control policies.Moreover, yields on U.S. sovereign bonds remain highly elevated. The yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note climbed to 5.076%. This yield is closely linked to the movement of the Fed fund rate. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note is currently at 4.23%. This yield touched 4.35% on Aug 21, its highest since November 2007.Finally, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX, the space travel company promoted by Elon Musk, wrote down the value of its bitcoin holdings by a total of $373 million in 2022 and 2021, and sold the crypto currency.Stocks to WatchNVIDIA Corp. NVDA reported second-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.70 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.

187,f83b39a6-465e-346d-b1c3-f5392ea89fe6,IBM,2023-08-30,15 Highest Paying Countries for Economists,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-highest-paying-countries-economists-113034953.html,1693395034,STORY,"['AMZN', 'IBM', 'UBER', 'GOOGL', 'AAPL']","[In this article, we will look at the 15 Highest Paying Countries for Economists. We have also covered key trends and companies for economists with an in depth analysis. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Economists. Why are Economists Important?In the intricate dance of world economies, economists serve as the choreographers, the maestros who orchestrate the symphony of fiscal policies, trade dynamics, and financial systems. Their profound impact on shaping the economic destinies of countries and guiding economic growth renders them indispensable figures on the global stage. While their roles in shaping economic policies is pertinent, universities and research groups are the largest employers of economists followed by the government. To read more about the impact economists have, do check out our article about the most influential economists in the world.Economists are also the architects of economic blueprints that steer corporations toward prosperity. They analyze data, predict trends, and devise strategies to mitigate crises and hence, foster stability and growth. For instance, when Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched the iPhone X in 2017 with a price tag of $999, economists likely conducted extensive market research to assess consumer demand at that price point. By analyzing factors like income distribution, consumer preferences, and price elasticity of demand, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) could gauge how the market would respond to the premium pricing. This helped Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) maximize profits without alienating its customer base.The complexity of the jobs of economists is matched only by the impact of their decisions. It's no wonder that their high salaries reflect their mastery of numbers. Speaking of high salaries, financial economics is one of the highest paying fields in economics but as far as highest paying jobs in economics are concerned, chief economists are economists with the highest salaries in the world. While economists usually love their jobs, some may consider it to be one of the most boring jobs that pay $100,000 or more. Story continuesOccupational OutlookSpeaking of numbers, the figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics provide a solid grounding for understanding the occupational outlook of economists. As of 2021, the median annual salary for economists was $105,630. Moreover, to pursue a job as an economist, a master's degree is usually mandatory. What's remarkable is that, unlike some professions, economists don't necessarily require prior work experience in a related occupation which make it accessible to fresh minds brimming with economic acumen. With a projected job growth of 6% between 2021 and 2031, the US predicts addition of 1,000 new jobs during this period.Emerging Trends Economists Must NoteThe world of economics is in a state of constant evolution, deeply influenced by technological advancements, globalization, and shifting socio-political dynamics. The rise of behavioral economics that studies the psychological factors driving economic decisions, has injected a human-centric dimension into the field for businesses.A small example of behavioral economics is the idea of ""girl math”, as highlighted by the viral Tiktok trend. This concept underscores how people find clever ways to make expensive buys seem reasonable. In their heads, consumers use discounts or other tricks to make spending on luxury items make more sense. This trend clearly highlights how behavioral economics is getting more influential. While our life is constantly changing because of technology, globalization, and other factors, ""girl math"" shows how consumer psychology plays a far bigger role in how they spend money than they anticipate.The OECD Economic Outlook, June 2023 has highlighted key insights for economists. Global GDP growth is projected to be 2.7% in 2023, rising modestly to 2.9% in 2024 which reflects a fragile improvement and below-trend performance. Despite a decline in headline inflation due to the energy price downturn, core inflation remains high, with OECD projecting a shift from 6.6% in 2023 to 4.3% in 2024. The report underscores the impact of high inflation and modest wage increases on falling real wages in 2022 and prompts governments to provide extensive support to mitigate cost-of-living pressures. Additionally, governments are advised to maintain restrictive monetary policies to combat inflation and phase out fiscal support while targeting vulnerable households. Emphasis is placed on pro-growth spending and structural reforms to address high public debt levels, budget deficits, and pressing future challenges. The Impact Economists Create for CorporationsAmazon.com,  Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s incorporation of over 150 PhD economists into its workforce revolutionized its decision-making processes. These economists play a pivotal role in the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s operations, influencing choices with data-driven insights. For instance, economists shape pricing strategies and leverage advanced algorithms to determine optimal price points. Additionally, their contribution to inventory management has led to impressive improvements which has reduced fulfillment costs by 5% in a year for Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Economists also played a key role in Amazon's Prime offering, determining which benefits most attract customers. Such data-backed decisions have significantly contributed to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s unparalleled growth, with revenue reaching $386 billion in 2020—a stark increase from $61 billion in 2012, largely attributed to their economist-guided strategies.Similarly, economists have also proven to be indispensable assets to Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)'s strategic evolution. The company has recognized the value of economic research in shaping its policies and decisions. With the addition of five full-time staff economists, these economists have played a pivotal role in quantifying and analyzing aspects like business optimization, marketplace dynamics, and policy impact. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)’s move towards economic rigor is evident in its exponential growth, with a valuation soaring to $120 billion in 2020 from $70 billion in 2017. By employing economists to inform business directions and policymaking, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) also demonstrated a shift towards a more transparent and informed approach.Economists have also wielded significant influence in shaping the trajectories of technology giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and International Business Machine Corp (NYSE:IBM).For instance, at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Chief Economist Hal Varian played a pivotal role in designing the auction model for the company's initial public offering (IPO) and navigating antitrust challenges. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s inclination to utilizing  economics in its decision-making is evident in its employment of approximately 300 economists and statisticians who empower data-driven decisions. Furthermore, their economic insights have enabled Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s continued dominance in the digital advertising sector, contributing to the company's impressive annual revenue of over $279 billion.Similarly, at International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), economists have been instrumental in revolutionizing business strategies. Martin Fleming, Chief Economist at International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), highlighted the transformative power of data analysis and artificial intelligence in achieving a forecast accuracy of up to 90% in predicting retail performance. This economic rigor has enabled International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) to optimize resource allocation, refine pricing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.Highest Paying Countries for EconomistsPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo list the highest paying countries for economists, we identified the countries with the highest demand for economists and then made a list for 27 countries with the average salaries for economists.

188,98057ecb-fa4a-3574-b731-c4f10779d645,IBM,2023-08-30,"Fujifilm and IBM Develop 50TB Native Tape Storage System, Featuring World's Highest Data Storage Tape Capacity(1)",PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fujifilm-ibm-develop-50tb-native-210000029.html,1693342800,STORY,"['4901.T', 'IBM']","[TOKYO and ARMONK, N.Y., Aug. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- FUJIFILM Corporation (President and CEO, Representative Director: Teiichi Goto) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the development of a 50TB native tape storage system, featuring the world's highest native data tape cartridge capacity1. Fujifilm has commenced production of a high-density tape cartridge for use with IBM's newest enterprise tape drive, the TS1170. The sixth-generation IBM 3592 JF tape cartridge incorporates a newly developed technology featuring fine hybrid magnetic particles to enable higher data storage capacity.IBM 3592 JFInnovations in achieving 50TB Native CapacityFujifilm has succeeded in achieving this innovative cartridge capacity by evolving the technologies developed in previous tape generations. This involved enhancing both the areal recording density (the amount of data that can be recorded per square inch) and the overall recording area (the surface area capable of recording data).Nanoparticle Design Technology: Fine hybrid magnetic particles have been newly developed by combining the technologies used in the next-generation Strontium Ferrite (SrFe) magnetic particles and the Barium Ferrite (BaFe) particles that are currently used in high-capacity data storage tapes. Reduction in the size of the magnetic particles and enhancement in their magnetic properties significantly improves the areal recording density.High-dispersion technology for magnetic particles prevents the aggregation of individual ultrafine magnetic particles and allows for a more even dispersion of the particles.Improved thin layer coating technology achieves a more uniform and smoother tape surface, resulting in improved signal-to-noise ratio.A 15% longer tape per data cartridge compared to the previous fifth generation2 is realized by using a thinner and stronger base film, which is for the support of the magnetic layer.AI enhanced analytics are helping organizations derive value from exponentially increasing volumes of ""big data"" and prompting the need for long term, cost-effective, high-capacity data storage. With the TS1170 drive and 3592 JF tape cartridge, data-intensive organizations including growing cloud service providers can take advantage of the increased capacity of 3592 JF for long-term retention and security of these massive data sets.Story continuesKei Nagata, Deputy General Manager of the Industrial Products Division at Fujifilm, says:""With 50TB native capacity, 2.5 times the capacity of the previous highest-capacity tape cartridges2, Fujifilm believes this breakthrough demonstrates the future potential of tape technology. The IBM 3592 JF tape cartridge is yet another milestone in many years of joint research and development with IBM, and we are honored to be the manufacturer of this product.""Alistair Symon, Vice President of Storage Systems Development at IBM, says:""The advanced technology in the IBM 3592 JF tape cartridge will enable customers to realize high densities, which facilitates storage cost optimization while maintaining performance and time to data. This is the first tape storage medium with 50TB native capacity, and it demonstrates tape's viability as an optimal choice for data protection, active archives and long-term retention in scientific data, industrial data collection and cloud service provider environments.""The innovation of the IBM 3592 JF tape cartridge, only available on the new IBM TS1170 Tape Drive, provides the ability to store up to 150TB of data on a single tape cartridge with a 3:1 compression ratio, enabling clients to achieve ultra-high data storage on the TS1170.About FujifilmFUJIFILM Corporation, Tokyo, is an operating company of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation along with FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corporation.

191,9fa47ca3-bc20-34b1-812d-773ed3bc07b0,MPC,2023-08-30,Marathon (MPC) Restarts Operation After Fire Incident,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-mpc-restarts-operation-fire-170700948.html,1693328820,STORY,"['MPC', 'NG=F', 'AROC']","[Marathon Petroleum MPC announced the operational status of its Garyville refinery, located in Louisiana. The refinery is currently operating at reduced capacity due to a recent fire incident that occurred. MPC is actively working on developing a plan to bring the refinery's operations back to normal levels. This decision follows the closure of specific units at the refinery, which was initiated three days prior due to a fire outbreak. Let’s delve into the details of the situation, the measures taken, and the potential implications for both the industry and the market.The Incident and Immediate ResponseOn a fateful day, the Garyville refinery faced a fire outbreak that prompted Marathon to shut down specific units as a precautionary measure. These units were near large storage tanks containing volatile naphtha, which ignited following a chemical leak. The refinery was not entirely shut down, demonstrating the company's commitment to maintaining its operational integrity.Environmental Impact and MonitoringIn the wake of the incident, environmental agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, along with Marathon's local team, promptly initiated air monitoring efforts. Reassuringly, the results of these diligent monitoring endeavors consistently indicated that there was no adverse impact on the surrounding areas. Marathon's proactive approach to environmental concerns underscores its dedication to responsible operations.Human Safety and WellbeingThe incident also had implications for the safety of the personnel involved. Two minor injuries were reported, emphasizing the challenging nature of managing such situations. Moreover, the firefighters who battled the blaze amid high temperatures along the U.S. Gulf Coast received the necessary treatment for heat-related stress. This serves as a reminder of the risks that the industry's dedicated professionals willingly undertake to ensure the safety of communities and operations.Story continuesMarket Dynamics and ImplicationsThe incident inevitably had an impact on the energy market dynamics, particularly concerning distillates, gasoline and blendstock. Argus, a reputable source of energy market information, reported a mixed performance in these markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast, following the incident. Notably, the price for ultra-low sulfur diesel increased to $3.24 per gallon — an achievement not seen since January. However, the price seemed to stabilize and displayed minimal change in the subsequent days.Global Reach and Supply-Chain ConsiderationsThe Garyville refinery plays a pivotal role in supplying diesel to European markets. This facet is crucial as it influences the intricate web of global energy supply chains. The recent disruption caused by the incident accentuates the potential vulnerabilities within these networks. Extended downtime could potentially lead to disruptions in these international markets, underlining the refinery's significance in the global energy landscape.Refinery Overview and Production CapacitySituated strategically along the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the Garyville refinery ranks among the three largest refineries in the United States. Its noteworthy production capacity of 596,000 barrels per day places it prominently within the industry's upper echelons. This expansive capacity is a testament to Marathon's commitment to meeting energy demands while adhering to rigorous operational standards.Operational Resilience and Future PreparednessMarathon's response to the Garyville refinery incident exemplifies its commitment to operational resilience and preparedness. The strategic shutdown of specific units and subsequent monitoring measures underscores the company's dedication to maintaining safety and minimizing environmental impact.ConclusionThe recent incident at Marathon's Garyville refinery has shed light on the multifaceted challenges and considerations faced by the energy industry. As the industry evolves, these events underscore the necessity for vigilance, preparedness and a relentless pursuit of safety. The incident's impact on markets and global supply chains serves as a reminder of the intricate interplay between operational facilities and the broader energy ecosystem. Marathon's commitment to restoring normal operations and enhancing future resilience is a commendable stride toward a sustainable and robust energy future.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, MPC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Evolution Petroleum EPM and Archrock AROC, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

192,45dcd6bb-08f6-3c35-b0c8-500ed956136c,MPC,2023-08-30,Oil: First real uptick in 2 weeks from Hurricane Idalia threat,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-dip-econ-data-210850089.html,1693321446,STORY,"['SCO', 'CL', 'NYF', 'MPC', 'HO=F', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- Crude prices rose more than 1% Tuesday for their first meaningful rally in two weeks as Hurricane Idalia threatened to strike at the heart of oil production and power generation in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Idalia skirted past its originally-thought destination Cuba and headed towards Florida's Gulf Coast, where it was expected to slam ashore on Wednesday, disrupting crude output and causing electricity outages. More than 20 counties in western and Central Florida have already issued evacuation orders.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled up $1.06, or 1.3%, at $81.16. The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 1.8%, after shedding 2.3% the week prior. Before that, it rose for seven weeks in a row in a rally inspired by Saudi-Russian production cuts that lifted WTI by nearly 20%.London-traded Brent settled up $1.07, or 1.3%, at $85.49 per barrel. Brent fell 0.4% last week, adding to the previous week’s 2.3% drop. Before that, the global crude benchmark also rose for seven weeks in a row, rising by a total of 18%.Concerns over slowing growth in China, the world’s largest buyer, have kept crude prices boxed at between $80 and $85 over the past month.Idalia threatens supply disruptionsBut the risk of storms hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast of Mexico could change that, analysts said.“The market is now vulnerable to spikes on the back of surprise outages and hurricane-related issues in the US,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“On the supply side, major producers appear committed to ensuring the market remains tight and prices higher. They had little success earlier in the summer but that is no longer the case.”U.S. oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) evacuated staff from three Gulf of Mexico oil production platforms ahead of the hurricane, wire reports said.Supply concerns were also heightened by a fire at a Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) refinery last week after a chemical leak ignited two giant storage tanks filled with naphtha.Story continuesOn Monday, Marathon said it planned to restart units at the 596,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, the third-largest in the United States.U.S. oil drillers were also cutting the number of rigs actively pulling crude out of the ground, indicating that production could further slow in coming months as the “supply squeeze is becoming more painfully obvious"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.But John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital pointed to the three-year highs in crude production estimated back-to-back over the past three weeks by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“The missing words here are ‘production efficiency’, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the U.S. oil industry,” said Kilduff. “This industry is pretty dexterous when it comes to meeting demand. We will have adequate oil, I believe, despite the storms and that should prevent prices from getting out of hand because of the storms.”U.S. data deluge throughout weekSome traders maintain a somewhat outlook for oil this week ahead of an abundance of economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve at its next decision on U.S. interest rates on Sept. 20.U.S. job openings slowed their most in 2-½ years and consumer confidence plunged as well.A second reading on second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth is due on Wednesday, while readings on personal consumption expenditures inflation - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - are due on Thursday, and August nonfarm payrolls data are expected on Friday.FedChair Jerome Powell on Friday said a week ago that the U.S. central bank may need to raise rates further to cool stubborn inflation, which would potentially hit economic activity in the world’s largest economy, weighing on demand for crude.U.S. oil inventories awaitedMarket participants were also on the lookout Tuesday for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Aug. 25. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.921 million barrels, versus the 6.135M-barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug. 18.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus was for a build of 1.234M over the 1.467M increase in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a climb of 0.045M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.945M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesOil: First real uptick in 2 weeks from Hurricane Idalia threatOil rises 1% on softer dollar, US braces for hurricane hitTexas power grid operator issues energy conservation appeal for Tuesday]"

The impacts of these initiatives were seen in the second quarter of 2023, wherein revenues and earnings increased year over year, and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from the strong performance across its portfolio and both business units.The company’s adjusted earnings improved 50% year over year, while net sales grew 12%. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 12.1%, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, and higher financial volume. Net sales per hectoliter increased 8.7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from the premiumization and geographic mix.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 20.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 0.7%. The stock also fared better than the sector’s fall of 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 10.5% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TAP’s 2023 sales and earnings suggests growth of 9.1% and 23.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s Delve DeeperMolson Coors, one of the largest brewers in the world, is on track with its revitalization plan. The plan is focused on achieving sustainable top and bottom-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities.The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space. It also plans to develop digital competencies for employees, supply-chain-related system capabilities and commercial functions. As part of the plan, the company has been expanding in adjacencies and beyond beer without hampering the support for its existing large brands.To facilitate these investments, Molson Coors plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure. The company is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, its cost-saving program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Additionally, Molson Coors is committed to growing its market shares through innovation and premiumization. The company has been rapidly expanding its above-premium portfolio over the past few years to accelerate portfolio premiumization.The company has emphasized that it has been working to reshape its product portfolio and grow in emerging markets. Sales of its U.S. above-premium portfolio have been outperforming those of its U.S. economy portfolio on strength in core brands.Management raised its 2023 view. Net sales, on a constant-currency basis, are projected to grow year over year in the high-single digits, up from low-single-digit growth mentioned earlier. Constant-currency underlying EBT is likely to grow 23-26% year over year compared with earlier stated low-single-digit growth.The company plans to increase investment in C-store shopper marketing in the second half of 2023. Also, favorable volume leverage is expected to partly offset cost increases. This, along with premiumization and lower contract brewing volumes, is anticipated to drive gross margin expansion for 2023.Story continuesWhat Holds Molson Coors Back?Molson Coors has been witnessing cost inflation, with respect to materials and manufacturing expenses, and an unfavorable mix. The cost inflation resulted in about 80% of the rise in COGS in the second quarter, driven by higher materials and manufacturing costs.Management continues to anticipate the inflation impacts on COGS for 2023. However, it is likely to moderate in the second half. Underlying MG&amp;A expenses are projected to be $100 million higher in the second half than the first half and rise 15% year over year. This will be driven by elevated marketing spend, which is likely to increase $100 million, coupled with increased people-related costs.Also, TAP has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions. On its second-quarter earnings call, management highlighted the softness in the beer industry. This is likely to affect the company’s performance in the near term. The company’s business in EMEA and APAC is likely to continue witnessing relatively high inflationary pressures.Management further expected a headwind in relation to the large U.S. contract brewing agreement. The agreement has started to wind down ahead of its termination at the end of 2024. Hence, it anticipates volume declines under this contract to be higher in the fourth quarter, with an impact of 2-3% of America's financial volume.Key PicksWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, Ambev ABEV and PepsiCo Inc.

CRBG, General Motors Co. GM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and EnerSys ENS.Add Value to Your Portfolio with These 4 P/CF StocksWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Corebridge Financial, Inc., General Motors Co., StoneCo Ltd. and EnerSys boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company's liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat's the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening.Corebridge Financial, which provides retirement solutions and insurance products, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 21.1% for three to five years.

GM has been utilizing Google’s (GOOGL) Dialougeflow AI software to power OnStar customer service for non-urgent requests. Yahoo Finance Reporter Pras Subramanian explains the implications of this latest AI push.Video Transcript- You guys. If we're talking trendy, we've got to go artificial intelligence, right? So I want to start there. Pras, the story on your beat in auto land coming out from GM saying that they've been using Google-powered AI chatbots with their OnStar service. And they said they've actually been using it for a little bit over a year now. But sort of giving more details today, it seems like, on what exactly has been going on.I personally viewed it as maybe just a shout out to make sure people realize they've been using AI, because I made that joke at the top that seems to help your stock recently. But you told me there's a little bit more going on here, and I should be impressed with it. So tell me what the big deal is.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, you're not wrong in the fact that this has been happening. They've been using AI chatbots with their OnStar, little button you push that asks for help.In the past year or so, they've been working with Google's AI as a dialogue software. I believe it's called Dialogflow software. Essentially, it's allowing users to tap in, say, hey, I need help with something that's not urgent like directions. And it'll actually say, hey, this is OnStar. Where do you want to go? And it'll actually talk to you in a conversational flow, as they call it. And then, people have been pretty happy because they don't have to wait for the operator to pick up and things like that.So they've been something like a million calls a month, something like that. It's taken away from their operators' workflow. So it's easier for them, better for them. But yeah, you're absolutely right.Story continuesIt's more AI hype. Look at us. We're doing AI. It also coincides with Google's-- they have their Cloud Next conference happening right now in San Francisco. So they kind of put that out there while this is happening.- This is exactly like the DoorDash AI story we were talking about yesterday.- You've got to make sure people know you're using it.- Using AI. And also-- oh, we're freeing up some of our workers to do other things. That way, we can have technology do this.It's funny because OnStar-- I guess they just stopped running those commercials. I just remember the OnStar commercials, like you got on a little accident. And like, oh, they're there for you. I didn't even know OnStar was still a thing.]"
197,655e30e1-5d8b-3d94-90e7-8bd928fdf69f,GM,2023-08-30,20 Countries with the Most Electric Vehicles in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-most-electric-vehicles-203245299.html,1693341165,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[In this article, we explore the top 20 Countries with the Most Electric Vehicles in 2023. If you wish to bypass the comprehensive examination of the EV industry, you can directly proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Countries with the Most Electric Vehicles in 2023.Over recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the presence of electric vehicles on the streets. As governments around the globe commit to environmental pledges, it's anticipated that electric vehicles, once considered rare, will become a common sight on roads everywhere.While the positive environmental impact of electric cars is unquestionable, they also offer various advantages to diverse industries, leading to heightened profits and productivity. This growth can lead to investment opportunities as the market expands. For investors seeking high-potential, growth-oriented sectors, small-cap electric vehicle stocks might be the gold mine they're looking for. To check out some EV stocks that you can add to your portfolio, check out 10 Best Small Cap Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy.The EV IndustryDespite Covid-19 and supply chain issues since 2020, both the EV and battery indices have outperformed the top-ten automakers and the broader market benchmark. In the first half of 2020, EV and battery indices recorded substantial growth by 70% and 40% respectively. This growth coincided with announcements of green recovery packages, net zero pledges, and increasing acceptance of EVs as the future of transportation, particularly in Europe, Japan, Korea, and the Scandinavian countries.It is evident that for automobile producers who have already dedicated resources to develop environmentally-conscious vehicles, the surge in enthusiasm and utilization of electric cars will undoubtedly yield favorable outcomes. Major names such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI) grew by 134% and 92% respectively at the time of market close on June 11. Companies are leading the way with state-of-the-art electric vehicles. At its Q2 earnings call, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)’s CEO and product architect Elon Musk said:Story continues“In Q2 we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So, it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support. This came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, we managed to achieve an operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year.”Almost all of the major vehicle manufacturers including Ford Motors Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE: GM) now offer an electric alternative in the automotive industry. Ford aims for 50% sales from EVs by 2030, investing $50 billion through 2026 in plants and software. EV versions of popular models like the F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E SUV, and E-Transit commercial van are already on sale. Similarly, General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM) targets 100% global EV sales by 2035, GM will launch 30 new EVs with an investment of $35 billion by 2025. Emphasizing fresh models, current offerings include Cadillac Lyriq, GMC Hummer; Hummer SUV, and Chevy Silverado in 2023.Electric vehicles also transform the transportation sector. Over the last decade, app-driven transportation services like Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) have emerged, which offers a ridesharing app and more. Its stock surged 89% this year, with analysts predicting a further 9% increase based on the average price target. Moreover, companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) are converting large portions of their delivery trucks and vans to EVs. These moves will increase the demand for commercial EVs and Amazon alone will invest $970 million in electric vehicles for its European fleet. These companies represent only a few of the companies currently in the process of shifting to electric vehicle fleets, and an increasing number are adopting this transition daily. In reaction to this trend, automobile manufacturers are also intensifying their efforts in the development of commercial electric vehicles.The EV sector could offer tremendous upside potential for investors ready to explore this high-reward market. Bloomberg predicts the EV market to grow to $8.8 trillion by 2030 and $56.7 trillion by 2050, mainly driven by passenger EVs. If the sales of electric vehicles continue to progress at the estimated rate then around $60 billion worth of electric batteries will be needed to meet demand. In the pursuit of advancing electric vehicle (EV) technology, U.S. manufacturers are intensively focusing on developing new battery technologies. These efforts are propelled by federal mandates and incentives. The ideal battery is expected to be safer, more affordable, and offer longer driving ranges. EV battery manufacturers rely on imported minerals, to combat this, there's a push to replace conflict minerals with domestic alternatives, reduce reliance on certain minerals, and develop new battery types like solid-state batteries. Federal laws such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are driving innovation in the industry. The aim is to create batteries that outperform expectations while meeting cost and sustainability criteria. This development is crucial not only for addressing environmental concerns but also for reducing dependence on geopolitically sensitive resources. Therefore investing in EV battery stocks has also never been more promising. Vehicle manufacturers and battery makers plan to invest $860 billion globally by 2030.Electric utility companies like Ohmyhome Limited (NASDAQ:OMH), IES Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ::IESC), and ABM Industries Inc. (NYSE:ABM), who are top manufacturers of EV charging stations also stand to gain as more EV owners will install home charging points. Other utility companies should anticipate increased demand and potential benefits from higher electricity use.

Google Cloud’s conversational AI technology, known as Dialogflow, is now handling more than 1 million customer inquiries a month in the US and Canada on OnStar. GM says the AI chatbots work on most model year 2015 and newer GM vehicles connected by OnStar.GM says the OnStar IVA services usually deal with non-emergency services in GM vehicles, but will in the future be able to distinguish between certain words and phrases that may signal an emergency and then route those requests to emergency response operators.GM's OnStar service (credit: GM) (GM)From a user experience point of view, GM says customers hear the familiar OnStar “voice” when using OnStar’s IVA service, and have “reacted positively” to experiences on calls without hold times.GM says the use of this technology has allowed OnStar employees to handle more complex tasks and that in the future IVA will answer more involved requests around buying, ownership, and other in-car experiences in GM vehicles.GM’s collaboration with Google’s Dialogflow technology is happening alongside Google’s Cloud Next conference, which started Tuesday in San Francisco.GM and Google have been cementing their technology relationship, starting with deeper integration of Google products like Maps and Music into the in-car experience, and will be deepening that partnership with a native Google infotainment system coming to its future cars, starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV. GM’s move with Google infotainment means it will drop the popular Apple CarPlay and Android Auto “phone projection” systems, which has customers and even GM dealers concerned.Story continuesGM is also using non-Google-powered AI technology, announcing earlier this year that it is using ChatGPT to help customers find answers to questions in the owner’s manual, program functions like integrated garage door openers, and integrate schedules in the car from an online calendar.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

199,ecd68c3d-2d55-3b51-9ffe-d33f3753f59a,GM,2023-08-30,Add Value to Your Portfolio With These 4 Low P/CF Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-value-portfolio-4-low-134800100.html,1693316880,STORY,"['CRBG', 'GM', 'ENS', 'STNE']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG, General Motors Company GM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and EnerSys ENS boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening.Corebridge Financial, which provides retirement solutions and insurance products, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 21.1% for three to five years.

200,985ce60a-ff63-3900-be6d-7a6b981069a6,GM,2023-08-30,5 Stocks With Attractive Price-to-Book Ratio Worth a Look,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-attractive-price-book-125000671.html,1693313400,STORY,"['GM', '105560.KS', 'KB', 'SEM']","[In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks, which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM, General Motors Company GM, KB Financial Group KB, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Corebridge Financial CRBG are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Mechanicsburg, PA-based Select Medical is a healthcare company, which owns long-term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, as well as occupational health and physical therapy clinics.

201,f9b3949a-0b5f-3722-918c-fd68b70f7e63,UAL,2023-08-30,17 Highest Paying Countries for Pilots,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-highest-paying-countries-pilots-112324413.html,1693394604,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[In this article, we will look at the 17 highest paying countries for pilots. We will also cover interesting aviation trends and discuss the highest paying airlines for pilots. If you want to skip our analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Pilots.The adage that ""the sky's the limit"" resonates strongly with the profession of pilots. Their training, experience, and commitment to safety justify the high salaries they command. With the responsibility of steering aircraft worth millions and the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, under their care, the demand for pilots is on the rise. This also explains why pilots are one of the most trusted professions in America. Moreover, cargo pilots have one of the highest paid positions in the aviation industry. The highest paid cargo pilots i.e the 90th percentile of these professionals can earn up to $137,096 on average. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the occupational outlook for airline and commercial pilots projects a 6% growth rate from 2021 to 2031, which is on par with the average growth across all occupations. By 2031, an estimated 18,100 openings for airline and commercial pilots are anticipated annually. The Boom of the Aviation IndustryThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently upgraded its outlook for the airline industry's profitability in 2023 and reflected a robust recovery from the challenges posed by the pandemic. Anticipated net profits for the airline industry have been revised to $9.8 billion, which is more than double the previous forecast of $4.7 billion. The improved financial picture is underpinned by several factors like the quicker-than-expected lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China, resilient cargo revenues, and moderating jet fuel prices.Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) stands as a noteworthy example of this upward trajectory. The airline's remarkable operational performance during the busy summer season has translated into impressive financial figures. In the June Quarter of 2023, Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) achieved a record operating revenue of $15.6 billion and a record operating income of $2.5 billion with a strong operating margin of 16.0%. Earnings per share soared to $2.84 and thus, affirmed the airline's profitability. Notably, Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) also managed its debt and finance lease obligations effectively, with a total of $20.2 billion at quarter-end. Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL)’s contributions to its employees were also evident as it has  allocated $667 million for next year's profit-sharing payment which is surely a testament to the airline's dedication to its workforce.Story continuesSimilarly, United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) also reported remarkable numbers in the second quarter of 2023 and hence, also reflected a robust recovery in travel demand. United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL)’s adjusted earnings per share came in at $5.03 which surpassed the expected $4.03, while its total revenue reached $14.18 billion and bet the anticipated $13.91 billion. Despite disruptions at its Newark hub, United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) achieved a remarkable 17% increase in total revenue compared to the same period last year, with net income soaring to $1.08 billion during the same quarter last year.Aviation Trends to Watch Out for in 2023The global trend towards single-pilot commercial aircraft has recently gained traction in over 40 countries including Germany and the UK and has urged aviation standards bodies to enable such flights. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency collaborated with manufacturers to explore the feasibility of solo flight operations. While this proposed change aims to reduce expenses and alleviate challenges stemming from crew shortages, the prospect of entrusting the entire control of an aircraft to a single individual raises fears among certain stakeholders due to the increased  responsibility involved.While there are various industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is also revolutionizing the aviation industry across multiple fronts. After over a century since autopilot's invention, aerospace engineers are leveraging AI to enhance safety, efficiency, and pilot workload reduction. Autopilot systems have evolved into fully autonomous flight control, and the adoption of AI technology is evident at major industry events. EASA's AI Roadmap 2.0 emphasizes human-centric integration and safety, while machine learning research aids AI system approval.AI's impact extends beyond the skies which further optimize ground operations. AI assists aircraft assembly, maintenance, and overhaul, while fleet optimization, flight planning, and ground operations benefit from AI deployment. Generative AI like ChatGPT holds promise that facilitates vertical integration with proprietary data for bespoke applications. Digital twins benefit from AI-generated images and models, expediting their creation and reducing costs.Despite concerns about job displacement, AI is expected to create roles maintaining AI systems, developing algorithms, and ensuring ethical use. Human expertise remains crucial due to AI's inability to replace human perception. The aerospace industry anticipates a complementary relationship between AI and human staff, driving enhanced efficiency and innovation.

The upsurge in passenger volumes makes the UAL stock an attractive investment opportunity currently.Let’s delve deep to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has been revised 14.5% and 16.5% upward over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.Given the wealth of information at brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.Buoyant Air-Travel Demand &amp; Other Tailwinds: Improvement in air-travel demand bodes well for UAL. Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, have been very strong with people taking to the skies again. Recently, management lifted earnings per share forecast for 2023, primarily driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario. UAL's efforts to upgrade its fleet are commendable as well. In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing in December 2022. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more.The new jets are expected to result in 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be replaced. As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians among others are also likely to be created.In response to the improved demand, United Airlines widened the scope of its code-sharing partnership with Azul AZUL. Under the expanded deal, passengers can fly to six new destinations after connecting from the designated Brazilian airports to Orlando or Fort Lauderdale on UAL flights. The six new destinations are Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, San Francisco, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. The customer-friendly move will allow them to travel using a single ticket for both UAL and Azul-operated flights. The expanded partnership between the two airline companies was built on their existing codeshare routes from Houston and Newark.Story continuesImpressive Price Performance: Driven by the uptick in demand, shares of UAL have gained 30.5% year to date compared with its industry’s growth of 12.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which UAL belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the company in the top 30% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.In fact, an ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider stocks like Ryanair Holdings RYAAY and SkyWest SKYW. While Ryanair sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present, SkyWest carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ryanair Holdings’ growth prospects are being supported by an upbeat in air-travel-demand scenario. An uptick in passenger volumes is leading the company to post impressive traffic numbers over the past few months.Measures for expanding its fleet to cater to the rising travel demand are encouraging as well. Riding on the buoyant air-traffic scenario, RYAAY shares have gained 31.7% year to date. RYAAY surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters by 21.4%.SkyWest's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. A fall in operating expenses due to a decline in fuel costs is another tailwind for the company.SkyWest’s environment-friendly approach also bodes well. SKYW shares have surged 154% year to date. SKYW surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters (missing once). The average beat is 31.5%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Pinnacle West has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IdaCorp has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PNW likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than IDA has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PNW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.88, while IDA has a forward P/E of 19.06. We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 2.92. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IDA currently has a PEG ratio of 5.18.Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P/B ratio of 1.47. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Jefferies Vice President of Equity Research Corey Tarlowe joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss consumer spending patterns.""50% of the people who we surveyed actually intend to spend more into back-to-school,"" Tarlowe says on the survey of 600 U.S. consumers. ""But clicking a little deeper, 70% actually cited inflation as the primary reason that they're spending more.""Tarlowe uses credit card debt and earnings data from retailers like Walmart (WMT) to forecast what could be in store for retailers in 2023's holiday season.Video Transcript- Well, now despite those inflationary pressures, American shoppers do intend to spend more on back to school supplies this year than last year. That's according to a new survey conducted by Jefferies. Let's bring in one of the authors behind the Study, Corey Tarlowe, Jefferies' vice president of equity research. Good to see you here, Corey. So for some of us, as parents out here, we're really feeling the pain here. Why is everything so much more expensive, and where are we seeing the biggest markup this year?COREY TARLOWE: Great. Well, thank you for having me. I think that the reason that things are so much more expensive is clear, and it's inflation. According to the survey that we did, we conducted a survey of 600 consumers in the US. And what we found that was interesting is that 50% of the people who we surveyed actually intend to spend more into back to school. But clicking a little deeper, 70% actually cited inflation as the primary reason that they're spending more.And as you click down by category, interestingly enough, apparel was one category where people are not only planning to spend more, but also even perhaps buy more units. So 50% of people plan to spend more in dollars on apparel, and again, that's because of inflation. And then 30% of people plan to buy more units in this category.Story continues- See, Corey, Rachelle is better than me because I would finna be right next to my student, right next to my kid in class if I'm spending all this money. I'm getting the education too. I'm brushing up on some of that stuff. I'm spending all that just for back to school. But all of this spending considered, what does this really tell us or forecast about the rest of the year? Because it's making it through back to school but also making it to the holiday season that many consumers might also be thinking about, and that credit card debt is starting to rack up a little bit more.COREY TARLOWE: Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up. So we have seen a consumer that's overall a little bit more resilient than what we expected. But we are seeing credit card debt continue to pile on for many consumers in the US. And so as a result of that, and this survey data that we conducted actually showed this, is that private label is becoming an increasing area of focus.And you mentioned that buying many branded items can be a pain point for you. Well, store branded items, particularly private label at a retailer like Walmart, are really resonating strongly with a lot of consumers in the US. And so our survey data indicated that 77% of respondents are actually likely to spend more on store brand items.And so as I think about a retailer that could benefit from this, it's Walmart. Because Walmart has, at least in the US, a private label business that's over 20% of sales, and that's a $400 billion enterprise in the US that again is over 20% private label. So that's $80 billion in private label sales, and that's one thing that I expect that well-positions Walmart not only to back to school but into holiday as well.- And what about the companies who used to benefit from this? Obviously, they're losing some market share now to the Walmarts of the world. Who is then falling off then if Walmart is now picking up the benefit of this?COREY TARLOWE: Well, I think Walmart's definitely taking a lot of share from many players in the retail space, whether it's traditional grocers or other mass players or even some convenience stores. So it's definitely a business that is gaining a lot of share not only online but also in stores.So far, at least quarter to date, we've seen Walmart comp up in the mid-single digits based on where they've guided, and then Target is comping down in discretionary categories in the low double digit to mid-teens in categories like home or apparel and hardlines. So there may be some continued underperformance in that category ahead at Target and perhaps a little bit of a better performance at Walmart ahead.]"

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF Value of Target (NYSE:TGT)The GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates.

To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares.

ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Target's ROIC was 10.05, while its WACC came in at 8.92.Unveiling Target (TGT)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

This makes the dividend yield 3.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Navient Navient's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Navient's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 9.7%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendNavient Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.50 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.5% a year over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Navient has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Navient Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Navient might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Navient has 3 warning signs (and 2 which are potentially serious) we think you should know about.

Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 13% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.8%.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPB’s fiscal 2023 earnings for the current financial year has risen 44% in the past 30 days.Let’s delve deeper into the factors driving the stock. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth PillarsSpectrum Brands is on track to improve operational efficiencies throughout and limit risks. Management is protecting and deleveraging its balance sheet, while solidifying liquidity. It is focused on transforming the company into a pure-play global Pet and Home &amp; Garden business.As part of its strategic transformation, the company completed the sale of HHI to ASSA ABLOY for $4.3 billion in cash on Jun 20, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. It expects $3.8 billion in net proceeds from this sale. With the sale of the HHI business, the company can now refocus on its core businesses and boasts a stronger balance sheet.The company’s Global Productivity Improvement Plan, which aims at improving the company's operating efficiency and effectiveness, while focusing on consumer insights and growth-enabling functions, bodes well. The majority of savings are expected to be reinvested into growth initiatives and consumer insights, R&amp;D, and marketing across each business. This plan will also enable the company to deliver value creation and sustainable growth in the long term.Moving on, better pricing, cost improvements and a favorable mix contributed to the third-quarter fiscal 2023 gross margin, which expanded 210 bps to 35.8%. Adjusted EBITDA advanced 23% to $98.5 million and beat our estimate of $89.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 360 bps to 13.4%, driven by lower distribution costs, fixed-cost-reduction initiatives and positive pricing impacts, partly offset by the reduced volume.Consequently, third-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings were 75 cents per share, up 39% year over year. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents.Story continuesOther Side of the StoryDespite such upsides, not all is good in the hood for Spectrum Brands. The company has been witnessing cooler-than-expected weather conditions and a greater-than-expected reduction of retail inventory levels, which hurt sales in its Home and Garden business. The segment's sales declined 6% to $186.6 million due to lower-than-expected replenishment orders for the pest control category, lower-than-expected POS and adverse weather conditions. The metric lagged our estimate of $204.3 million. Sluggishness in the small home appliance space due to lower consumer demand and continued higher-than-expected retail inventory levels acted as deterrents.This, in turn, hurt the fiscal third-quarter top line, which declined 10% year over year to $735.5 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $781 million. Organic net sales declined 9.7%. The downside was mainly due to retailer inventory management strategies and slower category POS, offset by positive pricing.For fiscal 2023, the company expects a mid-single-digit sales decline. This includes the adverse impacts of foreign currency. It also expects short-term demand headwinds to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also, the unfavorable currency is concerning for the near term.Wrapping UpAll said, we believe that Spectrum Brands will stay afloat through the ongoing tough economic landscape on the back of its transformation efforts, favorable pricing and cost-reduction initiatives. Topping it, a Momentum Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 30.4% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Bluegreen Vacations BVH, Royal Caribbean RCL and lululemon athletica LULU.Bluegreen Vacations sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, DraftKings Inc. DKNG, Marriott International Inc. MAR and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Ignores Powell's Rate Hike Warning: 5 PicksOn Aug 25, at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the inflation rate is still highly elevated despite steady progress in the past year. Consequently, the central bank is open for more hikes in the near future.According to Powell, ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.""Justifying the fact for the Fed fund rate to move higher, Powell said, ""The economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up.""Surprisingly, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — advanced 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, after Powell's warning of more rate hikes. The small-cap benchmark, the Russell 2000, also gained 0.4%.After Powell's comments, market participants are directionless regarding the future trajectory of interest rate movement. The CME FedWatch is currently showing that the there exists an 80% probability that the Fed will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, while a 20% chance of rate hike by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting.Story continuesHowever, for the November FOMC meeting, a 44.5% probability is assigned for maintaining the status quo and a 55.5% probability is assigned for a rate hike of 25 basis points or more.Whatever the situation, market participants have cheered the Fed Chairman's acknowledgment that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain rock solid despite suffering from a double-edged sword — a 40-year high inflation rate and a more than 22-year high interest rate.The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. On Aug 24, the Atlanta Fed estimated the GDP growth rate to climb 5.9% in the third quarter. These data eliminate the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.The major catalyst of U.S. economy is personal consumption expenditure (consumer spending), which accounts for nearly 70% of the GDP. Therefore, at this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in consumer-centric stocks to enrich one's portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) consumer-centric stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

214,27acba67-1dd1-3e24-ab86-75363f81c311,SBAC,2023-08-30,SBA Communications (SBAC) Gains From High Demand Amid 5G Hype,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sba-communications-sbac-gains-high-143700191.html,1693319820,STORY,"['SBAC', 'T']","[The advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services has fueled the rise. This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers to meet this incremental demand, aiding the demand for tower REITs like SBA Communications’ SBAC wireless communication infrastructure.The company has a resilient and stable site-leasing business model as it generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically five to 10 years) tower leases with built-in rent escalators. This assures stable site-leasing revenues for SBA Communication. In the second quarter of 2023, 89% of the total incremental domestic leasing revenues came from the big four carriers — AT&amp;T, Inc. T, T-Mobile TMUS, Verizon VZ and Dish.Moreover, in late July 2023, SBAC signed a new five-year master lease agreement with AT&amp;T. The deal will help AT&amp;T deploy 5G and other advanced technologies by leveraging SBA Communications’ vast U.S. tower portfolio, benefiting both companies. We expect 2023 site-leasing revenues to increase 7.1% year over year.SBA Communications’ portfolio expansion efforts into select international markets with high growth characteristics position it well to take advantage of secular trends in mobile data usage and wireless spending growth worldwide. In the second quarter of 2023, the company acquired nine communication sites for a total cash consideration of $7.2 million. It also built 64 towers during this period.Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, SBAC purchased or is under contract to buy 134 communication sites for a total consideration of $72.9 million in cash. It expects to conclude these buyouts by the end of this year.On the balance sheet front, SBA Communications exited second-quarter 2023 with $273.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments. Also, in the second quarter, its net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially to 6.6X from 6.9X.With ample financial flexibility, SBAC is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities. Also, the company’s current cash flow growth is projected at 14.77% compared with the industry’s average of 9.37%.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and SBA Communications has remained committed to that. Moreover, it has increased its dividend four times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 24.19%. Such efforts enhance shareholders’ wealth and boost investors’ confidence in the stock. Check SBA Communications’ dividend history here.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 1.6% in the past month against the industry’s decline of 4.8%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the company has a high customer concentration, and in the second quarter of 2023, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon accounted for 40.7%, 28.0% and 19.9%, respectively, of SBAC’s domestic site-leasing revenues. A loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them or a reduction in network spending will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line.  For 2023, management expects the churn arising from the Sprint-related decommissioning on the domestic front to be at the high end of its projected range of $25-$30 million. Moreover, the Sprint-related churn is estimated between $20 million and $30 million in 2024, and $35 million and $45 million in 2025. Further, it anticipates the international churn to remain elevated, in line with its expectations and the outlook stated earlier. Amid this, we estimate total revenues to exhibit modest year-over-year growth of 3.1% in 2023.SBA Communications has a substantially leveraged balance sheet, with $12.7 billion of total debt and net debt to the annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage of 6.6X as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. Further, a high-interest-rate environment is likely to result in high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.For 2023, our estimate for interest expenses indicates a rise of 12.5% year over year. Further, with high interest rates, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Source: MGM Resorts. Hyatt, Marriott, and MGM Resorts have been hit with lawsuits since 2019 over how they disclose mandatory resort fees. The companies have since changed how they disclose resort fees on their websites and apps.Hyatt in July began displaying nightly rates plus resort fees upfront on a traveler’s first search of its site and app, a spokesperson confirmed to Skift on Tuesday. The decision followed Marriott’s similar move in May and MGM Resort’s similar (and unpublicized) move earlier.Yet these moves won’t end the debate over junk fees. Lingering issues include how hotel rates and fees are displayed on online travel agencies; the fact that resort fees are mandatory; and how these fees are taxed in cities with hotel occupancy taxes.Hyatt and MGM Resorts Change on Resort Fees“After careful consideration, we made the decision to move to what we call an all-in rate display for hotels in the Americas,” a Hyatt spokesperson said. “As of July, the most prominent rate shown throughout the booking process on Hyatt channels for properties in the Americas now includes both the room rate and any resort or destination fees. This rate does not include taxes.”In May, Texas’ attorney general sued Hyatt over its hidden resort fees.MGM Resorts made a similar change without a public statement in 2021. The casino and hotel operator now discloses the mandatory resort fee for its 17 properties at the first stage of the search process on its site and app.Marriott began in May to display resort fees upfront for its 30-plus brands on its site and app. The move came in the wake of a 2021 legal settlement with Pennsylvania — which required the hotel operator to immediately disclose any extra fees for services and amenities offered during a guest’s stay.This October, Marriott International will start displaying 17 MGM Resorts properties on its site and mobile app as part of a licensing partnership. Marriott’s site and app will include the mandatory resort fees MGM Resorts in the first rates shown, a spokesperson said.Story continuesIn other words, the first rates that guests comparing MGM Resorts properties on Marriott will first see will be prices inclusive of the resort fees. Travelers booking directly on MGM Resorts’ own site and app will see the rate and fee broken out on the first result instead.Why It MattersDisclosing fees is important. When they are disclosed is important as well. Do it at the end of the process, and the buyer may be surprised by the true cost. A delay prevents a traveler from easy comparison shopping. That’s one reason why talk about so-called junk fees has grown louder this year.A case in point: Until 2021, whenever a consumer clicked on one of MGM Resorts’ properties in its search interface, they saw a rate advertised in a large font in a colored box. Meanwhile, news that a daily resort fee would be extra was shared in a small font in gray elsewhere on the page. At the last step in the online booking process, the purchaser was shown a line item for the resort fee, along with all other costs, taxes, and fees.In a lawsuit in 2021, Travelers United, an advocacy group, alleged that MGM Resorts’ practice violated laws against price deception for residents of Washington, D.C. MGM Resorts settled in October 2021, said Lauren Wolfe of Travelers United.Multiple Hotel Brands AffectedMarriott, Hyatt, and MGM Resorts had, until this year, been hardly alone in delayed disclosure of resort fees on their sites and apps.Hilton denies wrongdoing as alleged in an ongoing lawsuit against it on this issue by Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson launched in 2019. Texas is also suing Hilton.Some Choice Hotels franchisees, such as the M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas, charge resort fees without those fees being included in the upfront total rates on Choice’s site. Some Wyndham franchisees also engage in the practice, such as The New Yorker A Wyndham Hotel, without Wyndham including the fees in total prices displayed.Many smaller brands also charge resort fees.Have the Hotel Companies Done Enough?Marriott, Hyatt, and MGM Resorts still face some outstanding grievances from some consumer advocates and government representatives.“This is a positive step forward, but it actually does very little for consumers comparing hotel prices on booking sites like Expedia and Priceline,” said Randy Greencorn, who runs the site Resort Fee Checker. “On third parting booking sites typically display the price per night before resort fees, making hotels with resort fees appear less expensive than they actually are. This is potentially misleading.”It’s not fully clear who or what is responsible for that reality. This month, Texas filed suit against Booking Holdings, owner of Booking.com and other sites, for not disclosing resort fees and other fees upfront.Hotel groups also quote prices without resort fees in ad and marketing campaigns.At the municipal level, some U.S. cities charge a hotel occupancy tax, and they only tax a hotel’s advertised rate — meaning that resort fees appear to lead to lost tax revenue. In some jurisdictions, like New York City, major companies like Marriott are properly charging the city occupancy tax on the resort fee. But other companies, especially smaller ones, aren’t.Some activists complain that, in specific cases, the resort fees don’t provide legitimate value to guests as they occasionally include seemingly frivolous things like access to pools that all guests get access to anyway or offers of discounts for services some guests will want to opt out of.“Unlike the unbundled fees airlines charge that you can opt out of and fly in a seat, hotel resort fees can’t be opted out of, which is why we say their purpose is deceptive pricing,” Wolfe said.Yet of all the gripes, it’s worth noting that the landmark Pennsylvania case against Marriott focused on the upfront bundled display of rates that Marriott adopted in May.More Momentum?It’s unclear how large of an issue junk fees are.Research analysts at Truist believe U.S. hotel groups haven’t expanded the practice since 2019, with resort fees remaining “a modest” amount of total revenues — between 1 and 2 percent — based on data from HotStats, a benchmarking service.A survey by the hotel sector’s main lobby found that 94% of hotels don’t charge resort fees, said American Hotel and Lodging Association president and CEO Chip Rogers.“Since 2015, both the nightly resort fee rate and the number of hotels charging resort fees has continued to grow,” said Greencorn of Resort Fee Checker. “For instance, the average resort fee was $16.83 per night in 2015 and is now $26.50 per night, with many hotels charging more than $50 per night.”Marriott had roughly 180 hotels charging resort fees out of roughly 5,000, ringing up about $220 million in revenue between 2012 and 2019, according to Washington, D.C.’s attorney general.Yet the term “junk fees” has caught on in less than a year for a few reasons. Pennsylvania’s lawsuit against Marriott has inspired other lawsuits. Plus, a few national politicians, including President Joe Biden, are trying to use junk fees as a talking point.google trends on phrase resort fee to August 2023“All sorts of pressure from multiple groups, such as the president himself, many states attorneys general, and other sources have been pushing hotel companies to be less deceptive in how they display their resort fee prices,” Wolfe said.Context on Hotel FeesTravel ‘Junk Fee’ Crackdown: Skift ExplainsOpen Letter to the Travel Industry: You Won’t Win This ‘Junk Fee’ FightMarriott to Bet on Gaming With MGM Resorts Loyalty Program Tie-UpGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Dominating this sphere are C-corporation hotels, the titans that offer more than just luxurious accommodations and fine dining. They are maestros in hotel management, pioneering branding strategies, and dynamic marketing, orchestrating an ensemble of services that set the stage for remarkable returns on investment.Performance of the Hospitality SectorWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MAR. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?One reliable metric that captures the essence of their robust performance is the S&amp;P 1500 Hotels, Resorts, and Cruise Lines Sub-Industry Index. This index has showcased a strong total return of 41% this year, a testament to the resilience and profitability of the top hotel stocks. Such buoyancy in the hospitality sector is laudable in a world rife with economic uncertainties and unexpected events.Comparing Hotel Stocks with Broader Market BenchmarksFor context, total return is a comprehensive measure, accounting for both capital appreciation and dividends, to gauge the full spectrum of an investment's profitability. When you compare this with broader market benchmarks like the Russell 1000 Index, which marked a rise of 17% during the same period, the hotel industry's propensity for growth and innovation becomes even more apparent.Criteria for Evaluating Hotel StocksWe'll dig deeper into the most promising hotel stocks in our upcoming analysis. We will use the GuruFocus All-In-One Screener to filter out gems that outperform their peers in key metrics. We'll look at the 3-year Free Cash Flow (FCF) Growth Rate, a crucial indicator of a company's ability to generate surplus cash, crucial for both reinvestment and shareholder returns. Cash flow will serve as our underlying litmus test because if a company rapidly depletes its cash reserves, sustaining dividends becomes a tall order.Story continuesAdditionally, we'll delve into the Shareholder Yield, a comprehensive metric that includes dividends, share repurchases, and debt reduction to measure how well a company returns value to its shareholders. Finally, we'll scrutinize the payout ratio, as a high ratio compared to peers often suggests unsustainable dividends.So fasten your seatbelts as we embark on a spirited journey through the dynamic corridors of the hotel industry, unearthing stocks that promise a stay and a rewarding investment experience.Analysis of Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR)Marriott International Inc (MAR, Financial) has been a shining star in the Travel and leisure industry, boasting a year-to-date return of 37%. The hospitality giant topped estimates and saw international demand skyrocket, contributing to a revenue of $1.62 billion in the second quarter of 2023an impressive 14% surge year-over-year. Marriott isn't just tiptoeing its way through the year; it's taking confident strides.Its latest earnings report revealed a net income of $726 million, up 7% compared to last year, and an operating income of $1.13 billion, marking a 19% increase. Amid these figures, what stands out is the diluted earnings per share (EPS), which not only rose by 16% but also beat market expectations by nearly $4.Marriott's Financial IndicatorsBesides these stellar financials, Marriott's shareholder yield and dividend payout ratio outclass most of its competitors in the sector. Specifically, it ranks better than 73% of 795 companies regarding shareholder yield, and its dividend payout ratio surpasses 80% of 242 companies. The company has also showcased a promising three-year free cash flow growth rate per share of 27%, outperforming nearly 70% of companies in the industry.Marriott's Resilience and GrowthIt's worth noting that while Bernstein downgraded Marriott, the company's recent partnership with MGM Resorts for Las Vegas Strip booking and elevated international demand put it back in the spotlight. Thus, Marriott continues to exemplify resilience and growth in a competitive hotel landscape, making it a compelling narrative in hotel stocks.Analysis of Choice Hotels International Inc (NYSE:CHH)Choice Hotels International Inc (CHH, Financial) is an intriguing alternative for investors scouting opportunities in hotel stocks. The company has delivered a 15% return for the year to date, comfortably outperforming the broader hospitality market. It's worth noting that Choice Hotels' latest earnings report for Q2 2023 reveals a top-line growth of 19% year-over-year, with revenues hitting $213.1 million.While this uptick is certainly applaudable, there are some nuances. The company saw a dip in net income by 20%, and operating income also retreated by 13%. Despite these drawbacks, the firm's diluted earnings per share (EPS) surpassed estimates by nearly 4%, lending a mixed but overall positive hue to the company's financial portrait.Choice Hotels' Financial IndicatorsCrucially, Choice Hotels shows resilience in shareholder yield and dividend payout ratio, both key indicators for long-term sustainability in the volatile Travel and leisure sector. The company's shareholder yield ranks better than 53% of companies in the industry, while its dividend payout ratio of 0.19 places it ahead of nearly 79% of competitors. Its three-year free cash flow growth rate per share also stands at a promising 10%, signaling that the company has a knack for efficient capital allocation.Choice Hotels' Market PositionMeanwhile, as Marriott is busy with its Las Vegas Strip booking deal in partnership with MGM Resorts, Choice Hotels appears quietly but steadily carving out its space in the hospitality market. A diversified portfolio and a balanced financial sheet make Choice Hotels an option worth considering for those looking to add some hospitable flair to their investments.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, DraftKings Inc. DKNG, Marriott International Inc. MAR and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Ignores Powell's Rate Hike Warning: 5 PicksOn Aug 25, at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the inflation rate is still highly elevated despite steady progress in the past year. Consequently, the central bank is open for more hikes in the near future.According to Powell, ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.""Justifying the fact for the Fed fund rate to move higher, Powell said, ""The economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up.""Surprisingly, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — advanced 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, after Powell's warning of more rate hikes. The small-cap benchmark, the Russell 2000, also gained 0.4%.After Powell's comments, market participants are directionless regarding the future trajectory of interest rate movement. The CME FedWatch is currently showing that the there exists an 80% probability that the Fed will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, while a 20% chance of rate hike by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting.Story continuesHowever, for the November FOMC meeting, a 44.5% probability is assigned for maintaining the status quo and a 55.5% probability is assigned for a rate hike of 25 basis points or more.Whatever the situation, market participants have cheered the Fed Chairman's acknowledgment that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain rock solid despite suffering from a double-edged sword — a 40-year high inflation rate and a more than 22-year high interest rate.The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. On Aug 24, the Atlanta Fed estimated the GDP growth rate to climb 5.9% in the third quarter. These data eliminate the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.The major catalyst of U.S. economy is personal consumption expenditure (consumer spending), which accounts for nearly 70% of the GDP. Therefore, at this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in consumer-centric stocks to enrich one's portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) consumer-centric stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.Global equities were poised to conclude August with their poorest monthly performance in 2023 thus far, reported Reuters. The MSCI's broad index of worldwide shares, represented by (.MIWD00000PUS), increased by 0.2%. This positive trend aligned with Asia's markets benefiting from China's efforts to boost its struggling stock market and weak U.S. job data released on Tuesday, which suggested that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. European shares (.STOXX) also gained modestly on Wednesday, and the measure of Asian shares (.MIAPJ0000PUS) went up by 0.35%. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei (.N225), reached its highest point in over two weeks. Wall Street also joined the optimistic trend, as all three major stock indexes surged on Tuesday. Notably, the data on U.S. job openings for July showed the lowest level in almost two and a half years. This drop indicated that the tight job market was easing inflation pressures and that companies were adjusting their strategies ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting scheduled for September 19.European bond markets experienced a decline in response to recent German inflation data, contributing to a fluctuating market environment on August 30. Alongside this, stocks and US equity futures faced challenges, and Treasury yields underwent a minor dip. The release of economic data from the US led to a reduction in expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in 2023. Notably, European bonds showed a slip in value, indicating that inflation might not fully retreat in the eurozone. The 10-year yield in Germany surged by as much as five basis points, reaching 2.56%, prompted by the consumer price index's rise in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant indicator. Further reports unveiled an uptick in prices in two other states, even as inflation subsided in two regions. This trend also extended to Spain, where inflation also accelerated. The interconnectedness of these factors underscores the intricate dynamics at play in the global economic landscape, affecting various financial instruments and markets.Story continuesOil prices have slightly increased on August 30, reaching their highest point in over a week, as traders anticipate forthcoming data that could reveal a significant reduction in US oil inventories. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has experienced a fifth consecutive day of gains, nearing the $82 per barrel mark. This streak of gains is the longest since March. Notably, commercial inventories in the US declined by a substantial 11.5 million barrels, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry-funded organization. If this reduction is confirmed by official data expected later on August 30, it would mark the sixth decrease in inventories over the past seven weeks. These developments underscore the ongoing market focus on inventory levels, which can have notable implications for oil prices and market sentiment.Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), and NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street analysts.

It's possible that a too-good-to-be-true dividend yield is simply a side effect of a stock having lost a lot of value. And anytime a company's stock is slumping badly, it's worth wondering if its dividend is sustainable at current levels.AT&amp;T and Verizon, the latter being one of the Dow Jones stocks, are historically dividend stalwarts. But with their share prices under duress, worries about dividend cuts are to be expected.Both companies are contending with concerns about increased competition in wireless and slower industry growth, but the issue most punishing their shares these days are concerns over costs related to lead contamination cleanup.An investigation by The Wall Street Journal published in July found that ""AT&amp;T, Verizon and other telecom giants have left behind a sprawling network of cables covered in toxic lead that stretches across the U.S.""Costs associated with any cleanup could have ramifications for AT&amp;T and VZ's free cash flow (FCF), or the cash remaining after expenses, capital expenditures and financial commitments have been met. Dividends are ultimately supported by free cash flow.AT&amp;T, VZ dividends look safeAT&amp;T stock has lost about a fifth of its value for the year-to-date, pushing up the yield on its dividend to 7.8%. As for VZ, shares are off about 12% for the year-to-date, also lifting its dividend yield to around 7.8%.In what should come as a relief to investors, analysts say the selloffs on lead contamination fears are overdone. Perhaps more importantly, the dividends look safe.Story continuesCiti analyst Michael Rollins this week raised his recommendations on both AT&amp;T and Verizon to Buy from Neutral (the equivalent of Hold). He also maintained his ""High Risk"" rating on both stocks. Rollins argues that T and VZ could become turnaround stories if the costs associated with lead cleanup are lower than expected.""Market capitalizations for the telcos with possible [lead contamination] exposure are down $21 billion vs an estimated $15 billion cost of remediation based on latest disclosures and our estimates,"" Rollins wrote in a note to clients.Rollins' calculations suggest the costs of cleanup have been more than adequately discounted in the sectors' valuation. AT&amp;T and VZ could also get a boost if the competitive environment stabilizes, the analyst adds.At AT&amp;T, shareholders can take additional comfort in the fact that the company has been chipping away at its heavy debt load and freeing up cash. AT&amp;T generated positive free cash flow of $103.4 billion in 2022. That compares favorably against negative free cash flow of $67.7 billion the previous year.Over at Verizon, the company generated free cash flow of $11.5 billion for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023. That was after disbursing $10.9 billion in dividends.Buy, sell or hold?For the record, analysts as a group aren't quite as bullish as Citi's Rollins.Of the 29 analysts covering AT&amp;T tracked by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, 10 call it a Strong Buy, two have it at Buy, 15 say it's a Hold and two rate it at Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with tepid conviction.As for VZ stock's prospects for beating the market over the next 12 to 18 months, Wall Street is split. Analysts' consensus recommendation stands at Hold.Related ContentStocks With the Highest Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500Best Dividend Stocks for Dependable Dividend GrowthBest Blue Chip Stocks: 21 Hedge Fund Top PicksStock Picks That Billionaires Love]"

SFM, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, Atmos Energy Corp. ATO and McKesson Corp. MCK.Bet on These 4 Stocks with Exciting Interest Coverage RatiosAn ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only on the basis of the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.Often, investors evaluate a company's performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company's fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesSprouts Farmers Market, Inc., Molina Healthcare, Inc., Atmos Energy Corp. and McKesson Corp. boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Here are four of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Sprouts Farmers, which offers fresh, natural, and organic food products in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.

This compares to our projection of fiscal fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $518.2 million.Per the preliminary report, revenues in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment increased 2.9% from the year-ago period (up 3% at CER) to $662 million. This compares to our projection of fiscal fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $526.2 million.Catalent, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCatalent, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCatalent, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Catalent, Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateIn the quarter under review, Catalent’s gross profit fell 49.1% to $235 million. The gross margin contracted a huge 1389 basis points to 22%.Story continuesWe had projected 23% of gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 3.1% to $219 million year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $16 million, reflecting a 93.2% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter contracted a huge 1684 bps to 1.5%.Financial UpdateCatalent exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $280 million compared with $449 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Total debt at the fiscal 2023-end was $4.85 billion compared with $4.20 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of fiscal 2023 was $261 million compared with $439 million a year ago.GuidanceCatalent has initiated its financial outlook for fiscal 2024.The company projects revenues between $4,300 million and $4,500 million for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $4.21 billion.Our TakeCatalent exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings and dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances. The decline in Biologics segment’s revenues during the period was also disappointing. Rising operating costs leading to the contraction of both margins in the quarter do not bode well.On a positive note, Catalent’s better-than-expected revenues in the reported quarter and the year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment were impressive. Management’s confirmation regarding Catalent’s continued progress in improving its operational performance and winning new business with new and existing customers raises our optimism.In June, Catalent expanded its integrated development, manufacturing and supply solution, OneBio Suite, across a range of biologic modalities, including antibody and recombinant proteins, cell and gene therapies, and mRNA. In May, the company expanded the services and capabilities at its facility in Shiga, Japan, to include the storage, kitting, and distribution of advanced therapies at ultra-low temperatures for clinical trials. These developments look promising for Catalent.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCatalent currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are DaVita Inc.

A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.Often, investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO and McKesson Corporation MCK boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Sprouts Farmers, which offers fresh, natural, and organic food products in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. Its expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is 9.3%.

SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.3%, on average. The stock has rallied 38.9% in the past year.Molina Healthcare, which provides managed healthcare services under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.

That’s because it doesn’t emit greenhouse gas. Its only waste product is vapor, which we all know is harmless. And, if you’ve been watching the news, you know Goldman Sachs, for example, says the market for hydrogen production could reach $1 trillion by 2050. All of that is great news for hydrogen stocks.In addition, according to Research and Markets, the global hydrogen market could reach $206.65 billion by 2027 — thanks to concerns about carbon emissions and the rapid push toward green energy solutions for climate issues. Also, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) just awarded about $34 million to help advance clean hydrogen.That said, investors may want to jump on some of the top hydrogen stocks, especially ones that have become ridiculously and temporarily oversold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHydrogen Stocks: Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comThe last time I mentioned Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD), I said, “With the negativity priced into the gap, I’d use weakness as an opportunity. For one, APD is now technically oversold on relative strength, MACD and Williams’ %R. Two, the last time APD became this technically oversold, it bounced from about $270 to $304.”That was on Aug. 11, as APD traded at $285.50. While APD is still trading around that same price, consolidating at support, I still believe it could refill its bearish gap of around $300 with patience. It’s also still oversold, with hydrogen serving as a substantial catalyst. Helping, analysts at Mizuho raised their price target to $330 from $322. Better, the company just raised its fiscal year adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $11.40 to $11.50 from $11.30 to $11.50.Plus, the company expects to return more than $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders. At the moment, APD yields 2.46% and is one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy and hold now.Story continuesBloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockOn Aug. 11, I also mentioned Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE), as it traded at around $14.80. While it has since slipped to $14.25, it’s still incredibly oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R, as well. From a current price of $14.26, I’d like to see it initially refill its bearish gap around $18. Helping, JP Morgan recently raised its price target on Bloom Energy to $22 from $20. RBC Capital also initiated an outperform rating on the stock.Also, as I noted on Aug. 11, “We have to consider Bloom just unveiled two new products that could boost growth moving forward. For one, its Series 10 energy server is expected to meet the needs of those in the data center market. Two, it also just launched its advanced Combined Heat and Power (CHP) solution, which uses high-temperature exhaust steam for industrial steam production and absorption chilling, as noted by the company.Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (HDRO)3D illustration of Hydrogen moleculeSource: Corona Borealis Studio / Shutterstock.comOr, if you just want to diversify with most of the top hydrogen stocks at a lower cost, invest in an ETF, such as the Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEARCA:HDRO). With an expense ratio of 0.30%, it trades at around $8 a share. With this ETF, investors gain exposure to stocks such as Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Bloom Energy, Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP), Fuel Cell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL), and dozens more.To be included in this ETF, a company must generate 50% of its revenue from hydrogen and/or a fuel cell project, or be involved in developing fuel cells or hydrogen sources, according to Defiance ETFs.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings.Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible.""Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month, with ""Dune-- Part Two"" being the latest to push back its release date. Our next guest is warning of a $5 billion-plus hit to the economy as more delays pile up. Kevin Klowden, who is the Milken Institute Chief global strategist joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Kevin, great to have you here with us on this. First, perhaps, we start at the top here. When we think about the economic impact here, what is all being factored into that?Story continuesKEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but we're feeling anywhere that filming is taking place across the country and all the industries, and all the small businesses, and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible. That means trailer rentals, that means dry cleaners, that means restaurants, that means catering companies, that means construction, that means trucking, that means all sorts of different factors, and all of them are being affected right now. And even if the concentration is in LA, it's in New York, it's in Atlanta, it's in Albuquerque, it's in Pittsburgh, it's in Chicago, and in a number of different places where filming actually takes place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So, Kevin, I want to focus on that $5 billion projection. Within that, what industry or company, what will be the biggest laggard in dragging down that projection?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the biggest thing right now is it's no one company. Obviously, the majors factor in more than anything else. So Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity. So anybody who does film and TV, who does a large number of different productions-- so say Disney is a classic example of that, Warner Brothers, Universal, and even at this point, given the role they're playing, Netflix and Amazon increasingly become significant, even Apple-- they're all getting affected, but we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures. And the reason is that they can put off costs right now. The catch is that, as you were mentioning with ""Dune Part-- Two,"" is that as they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're at a time right now, Kevin-- this is Rachelle, by the way-- where obviously 65 years ago when we had a strike like this, you didn't have streaming services, you didn't have as much reality TV. So how does that really change the landscape of what we might see happen next with these negotiations and how far apart they are?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the big thing that you're dealing with right now that's different than 65 years ago is that the cost of living issue in Hollywood was not a problem 65 years ago, it certainly is now, it is in New York, it is everywhere. And that's a major driving factor, just simply being able to maintain the middle class as opposed to the studio system, which paid people a set amount on a regular basis each month. And people knew what was coming next, and they don't know, and that's the pressure everybody is facing. But the big distinction between now and say when the major strike last happened in 1960 is that it's all about where's the revenue coming from next. In 1960, the existential threat had become television, now it's about streaming. What happens next in terms of where is the streaming money coming from? Because streaming doesn't pay as well, not only for the companies but for the people working in it, as what we saw with DVD sales, what we saw with broadcast television, and so on.]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Here is a breakdown of Cummins Inc's GF Score:1. Financial strength rank: 6/102. Profitability rank: 9/103. Growth rank: 9/104. GF Value rank: 9/105. Momentum rank: 10/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score. With high ranks in profitability, growth, GF value, and momentum, and a decent rank in financial strength, GuruFocus assigned Cummins Inc the GF Score of 94 out of 100, which signals the highest outperformance potential.Understanding Cummins Inc's BusinessCummins Inc, with a market cap of $32.24 billion and sales of $32.19 billion, is the top manufacturer of diesel engines used in commercial trucks, off-highway equipment, and railroad locomotives, in addition to standby and prime power generators.

""It's an iconic U.S. brand, it's gorgeous.""Raimondo, who was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, confessed she had never before been to a Disney park but said she had seen all of the animated Disney movies.""How cool is this?"" she said.Disney has emphasized its Chinese links since Shanghai Disneyland - a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group - opened in 2016.Its attractions include a Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.But there was plenty of American culture on display - a Taylor Swift song playing on a loudspeaker, Wolfgang Puck pizza and Mickey Mouse everywhere.At one point, a seven-year-old Chinese girl wagging the tail of her LinaBell costume ran over a gave Raimondo a big hug and the pair spoke in English.Raimondo has said that boosting tourism between the two countries was one objective of her visit to China.On her last day in China, she also met with students to New York University and spoke to a women's business group.She ends her trip with a press conference at a Boeing facility in Shanghai in a hanger.

These achievements showcased Disney's ability to leverage its intellectual property (IP) across various platforms, from theaters to theme parks and streaming.Fast forward almost four years, and doubts have emerged about the wisdom of consolidating all these assets under one roof. CEO Bob Iger has pondered whether Disney has grown too large for its own good. Some Wall Street voices are even advocating for a breakup.Don’t Miss:Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups.

This New ‘Airbnb For RV's' Platform Takes On The $540 Million RV Rental Market With 25% In Savings And $50,000 For Renters is open for anyone to invest.Disney's parks business is showing signs of slowing down, its linear TV division is on a decline, and Disney+ subscriber growth has lost momentum. Dinsey appears to have lagged behind its competitors at the box office, leading to a nine-year low in its stock price and underperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500.MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson has questioned the company’s structure, proposing the creation of two Disney entities: one focused on parks, Disney+ and studio intellectual property and the other encompassing everything else, including linear networks, ESPN+, Hulu SVOD, Hulu Live TV and Disney+ Hotstar.""So why not make a clean break?"" Nathanson asked Iger on the earnings call Aug. 9.Iger remains tight-lipped about the future structure of the company, emphasizing the examination of strategic options for ESPN and the linear networks.Story continuesIger has identified three pillars that will drive Disney’s growth in the coming years: film studios, the parks and streaming. ESPN, in particular, is set to undergo a full transition to become a direct-to-consumer platform. Nevertheless, analysts and media experts warn that this journey could be challenging, primarily because of the high costs of sports rights and the potential resistance from consumers who already subscribe to multiple streaming services.Splitting the company into two entities could help Disney shed its debt, remove loss-making segments, and provide a clearer vision for its future in a rapidly evolving media landscape.Bank of America Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich argues against a clean break, stating that Disney's assets synergize, with studio IP driving the parks while linear networks generate cash for investments in growth areas like streaming.Ehrlich suggests leveraging the brand's intrinsic value to create new opportunities. She cites ESPN's $2 billion sports betting deal with Penn Entertainment Inc. as an example of untapped potential.But Nathanson believes that the current structure doesn't fully realize the value within Disney's assets and proposes the creation of a new company combining Disney's Parks, Experiences and Products segment with Disney+ and studio IP, potentially trading at a premium valuation because of its iconic assets and strong revenue growth.Reevaluating corporate structures isn't unique to Disney. Other legacy media giants, such as Paramount Global and Lionsgate, have explored similar paths. Paramount, for instance, recently abandoned plans to sell a majority stake in BET Media Group, recognizing that it wouldn't significantly reduce its debt. Lionsgate has also opted to split its studio and Starz business, reflecting a broader shift toward the streaming-first era.While the idea of splitting the company is on the table, it's not a straightforward decision, as Disney's various assets are deeply intertwined, and their separation could be challenging and may not necessarily resolve the company's current challenges.See more on startup investing from Benzinga:Consuming too much caffeine but still tired?

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings.Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible.""Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month, with ""Dune-- Part Two"" being the latest to push back its release date. Our next guest is warning of a $5 billion-plus hit to the economy as more delays pile up. Kevin Klowden, who is the Milken Institute Chief global strategist joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Kevin, great to have you here with us on this. First, perhaps, we start at the top here. When we think about the economic impact here, what is all being factored into that?Story continuesKEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but we're feeling anywhere that filming is taking place across the country and all the industries, and all the small businesses, and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible. That means trailer rentals, that means dry cleaners, that means restaurants, that means catering companies, that means construction, that means trucking, that means all sorts of different factors, and all of them are being affected right now. And even if the concentration is in LA, it's in New York, it's in Atlanta, it's in Albuquerque, it's in Pittsburgh, it's in Chicago, and in a number of different places where filming actually takes place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So, Kevin, I want to focus on that $5 billion projection. Within that, what industry or company, what will be the biggest laggard in dragging down that projection?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the biggest thing right now is it's no one company. Obviously, the majors factor in more than anything else. So Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity. So anybody who does film and TV, who does a large number of different productions-- so say Disney is a classic example of that, Warner Brothers, Universal, and even at this point, given the role they're playing, Netflix and Amazon increasingly become significant, even Apple-- they're all getting affected, but we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures. And the reason is that they can put off costs right now. The catch is that, as you were mentioning with ""Dune Part-- Two,"" is that as they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're at a time right now, Kevin-- this is Rachelle, by the way-- where obviously 65 years ago when we had a strike like this, you didn't have streaming services, you didn't have as much reality TV. So how does that really change the landscape of what we might see happen next with these negotiations and how far apart they are?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the big thing that you're dealing with right now that's different than 65 years ago is that the cost of living issue in Hollywood was not a problem 65 years ago, it certainly is now, it is in New York, it is everywhere. And that's a major driving factor, just simply being able to maintain the middle class as opposed to the studio system, which paid people a set amount on a regular basis each month. And people knew what was coming next, and they don't know, and that's the pressure everybody is facing. But the big distinction between now and say when the major strike last happened in 1960 is that it's all about where's the revenue coming from next. In 1960, the existential threat had become television, now it's about streaming. What happens next in terms of where is the streaming money coming from? Because streaming doesn't pay as well, not only for the companies but for the people working in it, as what we saw with DVD sales, what we saw with broadcast television, and so on.]"

Subscribers to his Disney+ Hotstar streaming service may be numerous in absolute terms, but each pays Iger only pennies on the dollar compared to customers elsewhere.The average revenue per user (ARPU) for Hotstar during the most recent fiscal third quarter came in at just $0.59 per month, a fraction of the $6.58 for Disney+ everywhere else.Disney pulled out of streaming rights bidding warIn June 2022, Disney consequently made the decision to exit a bidding war with Asia's wealthiest tycoon—Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani—to stream IPL after the organizing body auctioned the digital rights off separately from the linear rights.Instead, it opted to buy just the right to broadcast matches via television at the cost of $3 billion, a 50% increase over its previous 2017 deal which at the time had included streaming as well.“We made disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value,” said Disney’s head of international content, Rebecca Campbell, at the time. “We chose not to proceed with the digital rights given the price required to secure that package.”It was widely predicted this would hurt subscriber numbers, but even analysts were likely surprised by the plunge.The loss of 12.5 million in the fiscal third quarter after 4.6 million in the previous one was so embarrassing, Disney eliminated Hotstar numbers from its investor presentation entirely and gave the Indian streaming business only a perfunctory mention during the quarterly update.“We adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings,” Iger said earlier this month, before moving on.All told, Disney+ Hotstar subscriber numbers dropped to just 40.4 million from a peak of 61.3 million last October. That means it lost a full third of its audience in the space of just nine months.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the proposed transaction between ONEOK and Magellan (the ""Proposed Transaction""), the expected closing of the Proposed Transaction and the timing thereof and as adjusted descriptions of the post-transaction company and its operations, strategies and plans, integration, debt levels and leverage ratio, capital expenditures, cash flows and anticipated uses thereof, synergies, opportunities and anticipated future performance, including maintaining current ONEOK management, enhancements to investment-grade credit profile, an expected accretion to earnings and free cash flow, dividend payments and potential share repurchases, increase in value of tax attributes and expected impact on EBITDA. Information adjusted for the Proposed Transaction should not be considered a forecast of future results. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this communication. These include the risk that ONEOK's and Magellan's businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that cost savings, synergies and growth from the Proposed Transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the risk that the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies expect; the possibility that shareholders of ONEOK may not approve the issuance of new shares of ONEOK common stock in the Proposed Transaction or that unitholders of Magellan may not approve the Proposed Transaction; the risk that a condition to closing of the Proposed Transaction may not be satisfied, that either party may terminate the merger agreement or that the closing of the Proposed Transaction might be delayed or not occur at all; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the Proposed Transaction; the occurrence of any other event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction; the risk that changes in ONEOK's capital structure and governance could have adverse effects on the market value of its securities; the ability of ONEOK and Magellan to retain customers and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their suppliers and customers and on ONEOK's and Magellan's operating results and business generally; the risk the Proposed Transaction could distract management from ongoing business operations or cause ONEOK and/or Magellan to incur substantial costs; the risk of any litigation relating to the Proposed Transaction; the risk that ONEOK may be unable to reduce expenses or access financing or liquidity; the impact of a pandemic, any related economic downturn and any related substantial decline in commodity prices; the risk of changes in governmental regulations or enforcement practices, especially with respect to environmental, health and safety matters; and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. All such factors are difficult to predict and are beyond ONEOK's or Magellan's control, including those detailed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus (as defined below). All forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that ONEOK and Magellan believe to be reasonable but that may not prove to be accurate. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and neither ONEOK nor Magellan undertakes any obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis communication includes certain projections of non-GAAP financial measures. Due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the information excluded from these projected measures, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, Magellan and ONEOK are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort. Consequently, no disclosure of estimated comparable GAAP measures is included, and no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures is included.IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT In connection with the Proposed Transaction, on July 25, 2023, ONEOK and Magellan each filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus (the ""joint proxy statement/prospectus""), and each party has and will file other documents regarding the Proposed Transaction with the SEC.

We trimmed shares earlier in the year after the company reported decelerating fundamental results. While the primary driver of the top-line miss was lower index revenues (a function of market volatility), the other businesses were not able to offset the decline as we would have expected. Then the company announced an acquisition of Adenza, a provider of risk management and regulatory software for the financial services industry.

Reuters was first to report on Youngwood's appointment.The move comes as Nasdaq tries under CEO Adena Friedman to reshape itself as a major player in the financial technology industry.In June, Nasdaq agreed to buy software firm Adenza for $10.5 billion as part of that strategy.Last year, Nasdaq reorganized its business into three key divisions, as part of its strategy to diversify its portfolio of technology and intellectual property and bolster more high-growth areas as it looked to move away from its traditional focus on equities trading.Earlier this year, Nasdaq appointed Tal Cohen and Nelson Griggs each as presidents, formalizing the corporate structure the company put in place to boost its efforts in major growth areas, like anti-financial crime software.Youngwood, who has joint French-U.S. citizenship, was named group CFO at UBS in December 2021 and started in the role in May 2022. Earlier this year, Youngwood left UBS after it completed its deal to buy Credit Suisse.Prior to her role at the Swiss bank, Youngwood had been at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, serving as the financial chief of its Consumer &amp; Community Banking line of business.

In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of 2.21M barrels.On the fuels side, API reported a gasoline build of 1.4M barrels and a distillate stock gain of 2.46M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 0.153M barrel draw for gasoline and 1.898M deficit for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that fell for the first time last week after a seven-week rally.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.921 million barrels, versus the 6.135M-barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug. 18.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus was for a build of 1.234M over the 1.467M increase in the previous week.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth. Investing in dividend stocks is not just about finding companies with a history of paying dividends. It is also important to consider whether those dividends are growing over time. Increasing dividends makes a stock more appealing to people who want to earn regular income from their investments. This combination of consistent payments and growing dividends is a winning strategy for successful dividend stock investing.Although the market has favored tech stocks this year, it appears to be a favorable time to consider investing in dividend stocks as the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated the possibility of increasing interest rates. Here are some comments from the Fed chief at the US central bank’s annual conference on August 25:“Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”High-interest rate periods have historically fared well for dividend stocks. In one of our articles, we referred to Global X data, which revealed that from January 1960 to December 2017, about half of the returns from high-dividend stocks originated from dividends paid during times of elevated interest rates. During this period, portfolios containing high-dividend stocks yielded an average annual return of 13.02%, surpassing the S&amp;P 500's return of 10%. The report also mentioned that in seven out of ten instances when interest rates were rising during this period, high-dividend stocks demonstrated superior performance compared to the broader market.Another important aspect of dividends becomes evident when considering the impact of compounding. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, this compounding effect was examined for the S&amp;P 500 across various timeframes. The data used were averages for each continuous period, based on monthly data spanning 50 years up to June 30, 2021. The results reveal that as the time horizon extends, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, showing a positive correlation between the two factors. For instance, when comparing the annualized difference between the price return and total return of the S&amp;P 500 over each 10-year span, the average difference amounts to almost 78%.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Milken Institute Chief Global Strategist Kevin Klowden estimates that the economy will take a $5 billion plus hit from the ongoing strikes. Klowden joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his findings.Klowden says, ""the main thing we’re really factoring into it, is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we’re really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but were feeling anywhere that filming is talking place across the country and in all the industries and all the small business and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible.""Major companies like Disney (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN), are ""all getting affected, but we don’t see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures,"" Klowden says. Klowden explains that these companies are able to ""put off costs right now, but ""the catch is"" with these delayed movie releases, ""their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Key issues between Hollywood writers and studios still linger as the strike heads into its fifth month, with ""Dune-- Part Two"" being the latest to push back its release date. Our next guest is warning of a $5 billion-plus hit to the economy as more delays pile up. Kevin Klowden, who is the Milken Institute Chief global strategist joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Kevin, great to have you here with us on this. First, perhaps, we start at the top here. When we think about the economic impact here, what is all being factored into that?Story continuesKEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages. But when we talk about lost wages, we're really not just talking about the salaries and impacts that people are feeling in Hollywood itself, but we're feeling anywhere that filming is taking place across the country and all the industries, and all the small businesses, and all the little side elements that combine to actually make what we consider Hollywood possible. That means trailer rentals, that means dry cleaners, that means restaurants, that means catering companies, that means construction, that means trucking, that means all sorts of different factors, and all of them are being affected right now. And even if the concentration is in LA, it's in New York, it's in Atlanta, it's in Albuquerque, it's in Pittsburgh, it's in Chicago, and in a number of different places where filming actually takes place.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So, Kevin, I want to focus on that $5 billion projection. Within that, what industry or company, what will be the biggest laggard in dragging down that projection?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the biggest thing right now is it's no one company. Obviously, the majors factor in more than anything else. So Hollywood's been very heavily concentrated in terms of production activity. So anybody who does film and TV, who does a large number of different productions-- so say Disney is a classic example of that, Warner Brothers, Universal, and even at this point, given the role they're playing, Netflix and Amazon increasingly become significant, even Apple-- they're all getting affected, but we don't see it as much on their bottom line as we do on the workers and we see it on the general expenditures. And the reason is that they can put off costs right now. The catch is that, as you were mentioning with ""Dune Part-- Two,"" is that as they delay movies, that means their ability to get the revenue back to be able to get their expenditures back becomes harder and harder, and they forego revenues and they forego any ability to easily snap back out of this strike the longer it goes on.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We're at a time right now, Kevin-- this is Rachelle, by the way-- where obviously 65 years ago when we had a strike like this, you didn't have streaming services, you didn't have as much reality TV. So how does that really change the landscape of what we might see happen next with these negotiations and how far apart they are?KEVIN KLOWDEN: Well, the big thing that you're dealing with right now that's different than 65 years ago is that the cost of living issue in Hollywood was not a problem 65 years ago, it certainly is now, it is in New York, it is everywhere. And that's a major driving factor, just simply being able to maintain the middle class as opposed to the studio system, which paid people a set amount on a regular basis each month. And people knew what was coming next, and they don't know, and that's the pressure everybody is facing. But the big distinction between now and say when the major strike last happened in 1960 is that it's all about where's the revenue coming from next. In 1960, the existential threat had become television, now it's about streaming. What happens next in terms of where is the streaming money coming from? Because streaming doesn't pay as well, not only for the companies but for the people working in it, as what we saw with DVD sales, what we saw with broadcast television, and so on.]"

Adams as Mike Ross and Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane in ""Suits."" (USA Network / NBCU Photo Bank / NBCUniversal )A month ago, Erica Moreali flipped through the channels on her TV and all she saw were repeats.The El Segundo-based HR consultant became hooked on ""Suits,"" a legal drama starring Meghan Markle that first ran on USA Network 12 years ago but became available on Netflix in June. She had heard about the show years ago but hadn't watched it before.""It's just a night where nothing was on TV and I went to Netflix ... and 'Suits' was there — it literally was right in my face,"" the 46-year-old said.Moreali binged several episodes that night. About a week ago, she finished the whole series, devouring all eight seasons that were available on Netflix, plus the final ninth season streaming on Amazon's Prime Video, for a total of roughly 90 hours.""Suits,"" which was produced by NBCUniversal's Universal Cable Productions (now known as Universal Content Productions), has become an unlikely sensation for Netflix. Its first two seasons landed on Netflix's top 10 most watched series in the U.S. for at least nine weeks, according to the Los Gatos, Calif.-based streaming service.This summer, ""Suits,"" which is on both Netflix and Peacock (owned by NBCUniversal parent Comcast), has been the most streamed title for six consecutive weeks on U.S. television sets, with more than 20 billion viewing minutes, according to Nielsen. ""Suits"" set a viewership record for a series acquired by a streaming service, Nielsen said in a recent report.Read more: Writers' strike: What happened, how it ended and its impact on Hollywood""Suits,"" which follows a young man (played by Patrick J. Adams) who scores a job at a prestigious New York legal firm despite never attending law school, wasn't the obvious candidate to become a latter-day streaming hit.When the legal drama ran on USA Network, it didn't create the generation-defining buzz of ""Friends"" or the water cooler dominance of ""Game of Thrones."" Though a robust performer for USA, it was hardly a ratings juggernaut. In 2019, the final season averaged an audience of about 2.1 million per episode, including delayed viewing, according to Nielsen.Story continuesRead more: What makes a streaming hit? Desperate fans 'game the system' to save favorite showsBut amid the typical doldrums of the summer TV season, worsened by the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes that have shut down the bulk of production on scripted shows and films, Moreali and other consumers are turning to old hits from basic cable and broadcast television to satisfy their entertainment needs.The strikes by film and TV writers and actors, who are fighting for higher pay from streaming shows, have shut down or delayed work on future seasons of popular series including ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix and ""Severance"" on Apple TV+. New episodes of hit series like ABC's ""Abbott Elementary"" and anticipated films like Warner Bros.' ""Dune: Part Two"" and Sony's “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” have been pushed back due to the work stoppages.People spend about 13 hours consuming media a day across different formats, and ""the attention has to go somewhere,"" said Scott Purdy, U.S. national media industry leader for audit, tax and advisory services firm KPMG.When newer programs aren't available, consumers may revisit or watch older TV shows or movies for the first time.""If you had dropped a new 'Stranger Things' season or if you dropped another 'House of the Dragon,' that would be the most watched on those platforms, so I think this is the archives, the libraries, filling a gap of the new content,"" Purdy said.Other older shows have seen a recent surge in popularity as viewers seek the programming version of comfort food.They include the series ""Ugly Betty,"" which starred America Ferrera and originally aired on ABC and is available on Hulu and Netflix; and ""What Men Want,"" a 2019 romantic comedy film starring Taraji P. Henson that is available in Netflix in certain countries, although not currently in the U.S.Adam Shankman, director of ""What Men Want,"" said he was surprised when he learned how well the movie was doing on Netflix, where it placed in the top 10 English-language films in 60 countries, including Brazil, France and Iceland.""I'm just happy that people are laying eyeballs on it, because it's a silly, fun movie that was designed purely to make people laugh,"" Shankman said.The phenomenon of older, licensed titles being rediscovered by new fans on Netflix is not new. Some have deemed it the ""Netflix effect."" Shows that were once on regular, linear television could find new viewers among younger generations who never subscribed to a traditional pay-TV bundle. This was a key element of Netflix's rise to prominence, in which many viewers discovered shows like ""Breaking Bad,"" which originated on AMC Network.But why ""Suits,"" of all shows?Sometimes titles can gain popularity if there are events that spur interest in certain celebrities, such as Ferrera, who starred in the summer blockbuster “Barbie.”Aaron Korsh, creator of ""Suits,"" credits the popularity boost to interest in Markle (now the duchess of Sussex), Netflix's skill at pushing a show and a ""Suits"" scene that went viral on social media. The scene, in which a hot-shot lawyer takes a chance on a down-on-his-luck young man, has made the rounds on TikTok.""[The show] has an inherent optimism to it, and I think that's a real part of what people respond to,"" Korsh said.""Suits"" has been available on Peacock since July 2020, but demand for the show significantly picked up after it came to Netflix on June 17, according to Parrot Analytics, a data firm that tracks demand for content via consumption data, social video, search traffic, social media mentions and other metrics. Netflix has more than 238 million users compared with Peacock's 24 million paid subscribers in the second quarter, meaning more people suddenly had an opportunity to see it.Netflix put the show right in front of many viewers on their welcome screens, boosting its momentum.Some members of the Writers Guild of America have cited the ""Suits"" phenomenon as an example of why the union is striking for higher pay based on a show's success. Writers earn residuals when a show is licensed to a streaming service like Netflix but do not get more in the event that viewership skyrockets.“It would be better if we got paid more money when our viewership numbers went up,” Korsh said. “I don’t know if that means we’re going to achieve it retroactively, but I do think it is reasonable and achievable to expect residuals to go up, commensurate with increased views.”Netflix declined to comment for this article.Parrot Analytics analyst Wade Payson-Denney said he thinks ""Suits"" would have been popular on Netflix even without the strikes. Other series that started on linear television gained even bigger followings since they came to Netflix include ""You,"" ""Lucifer"" and ""Manifest.""""Netflix has so much more scale and ubiquity in the market than any of its competitors at this point,"" Payson-Denney said. ""I believe it had more to do with Netflix's scale and reach than the strikes themselves.""Part of the appeal of long-running series like ""Suits"" is that they allow viewers to become invested in the characters and story over time but don't require fans to obsessively watch every move on the screen. The enduring CBS procedural ""Criminal Minds"" and the sitcom ""Young Sheldon"" are among the shows people watch after viewing ""Suits,"" the analyst added.""It's that sort of comfort viewing, but put it in the background kind of TV,"" Payson-Denney said.Read more: 'Friends' is the gift that keeps on giving to WarnerMediaStreamers have ponied up hundreds of millions of dollars for older series from the 1990s and 2000s, such as ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld,"" that have found younger audiences online. For example, NBCUniversal paid $500 million to get the streaming rights to ""The Office"" for five years, outbidding Netflix.As the dual Hollywood strikes continue, some industry observers said streaming services with large libraries of content — such as Netflix — will have a competitive advantage compared to those that do not, as production slows down and consumers run out of new movies and TV shows to watch.Read more: The studios went public with their WGA offer. Was it a mistake?But streamers still need to produce quality content to keep drawing new customers and satisfy existing ones. Relying on oldies is not a long-term solution, analysts caution.""If this goes on too long, in a year from now, they don't have the materials to bring in the viewers and add to their subscriptions,"" said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s film school. ""Once people realized I've watched everything there is to watch, then you certainly don't renew your subscription.""Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

The insurance industry offers enduring potential returns in various economic climates. Thus, for those worried about some potential stormy skies ahead, this is a common landing place for many investors.However, various risks tied to climate change (increases in wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters) may be changing the calculus for this sector. A number of insurance companies are exiting weather-prone states such as California and Florida, creating the potential for insurance deserts. This, in turn, could significantly impact certain housing markets.With that, insurance rates will likely rise to meet these increased future costs. Yet, one must wonder if the insurance sector is growing too risky, given the risk of rising claims relative to premium revenue for top property insurance companies. Here are three I think investors should be cautious with right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAllstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInsurance leader Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is often a top choice for investors looking at this broader sector. The company provides a range of insurance services, with a focus on home and auto insurance, in the U.S. and Canada. Allstate is one of the insurers that has decided to pull coverage from high-risk markets. Whether this means the company will simply concede profitable market share to competitors, or is dodging a bullet, remains to be seen. However, investors don’t seem to be very bullish on the company’s outlook, with ALL stock trading at just 5.8-times free cash flow. That’s considerably below the sector median of 7.7-times.The company is diversified and does have a better relative valuation than the other names on this list. However, I think Allstate is a stock that’s not worth the risk, and could be a value trap even at these enticing levels.Progressive Corp (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockStory continuesYou’re likely acquainted with Progressive (NYSE:PGR), the second-largest U.S. car insurer. Amid this year’s decline, it’s a viable rebound contender. As with peers, rising expenses have impacted the firm. Escalating repair costs, pricier tech parts, and labor challenges have pressured auto insurers, hampering underwriting profits.Progressive’s Q2 earnings report was disappointing, causing a 13% share drop. The company noted unfavorable reserve development due to auto products. Despite short-term challenges, PGR’s captive customers through mandatory auto insurance in most states is an advantage. The increasingly perilous road conditions, exacerbated by the pandemic, make insurance essential. Given potential Federal Reserve impact, Progressive remains a sensible choice.If the broader environment takes a turn for the worse, Progressive’s financials put the company in one of the worst positions of its peers, in my view.Prudential Financial (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) faces turbulence despite a decent Q1. Second-half performance concerns arise as Q1’s 12.5% decline in assets under management hints at future challenges.Prudential faces a significant risk due to its substantial CMBS portfolio, vulnerable to a commercial real estate market downturn. Predicted value drop could affect its financial stability, leading to a complex future of challenges and opportunities.In Q2, Prudential’s net income was $511 million, a significant rebound from a $1.01 billion loss last year. Group Insurance achieved record operating earnings. Prudential might not gain like other stocks, but its stable dividend yield surpasses 5%. With that in mind, I’d caution investors about PRU stock appearing as a dividend trap at these levels. It’s one I’m avoiding right now for this reason.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -6.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.55 points to a change of -33.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -26.8%. The $15.3 billion and $16.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -20.2% and +5.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. EPS of $1.18 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.23%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

277,478b6162-5fb1-3470-9ba9-1827bbd095c6,DVN,2023-08-30,7 Very Oversold Energy Stocks to Buy Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-very-oversold-energy-stocks-110035992.html,1692874835,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'EGY', 'CPE', 'DVN', 'STR', 'DHT']","[With the recent run-up in crude oil prices, there are not of names that fit perfectly into the oversold energy stocks category. Scores of stocks in the energy sector, particularly shares in exploration and production companies, have zoomed higher in line with crude oil price trends.Yet among the 263 names in this sector trading on major exchanges (according to Finviz), there are few that stand out as stocks still underappreciated by the market.Some may believe that crude oil’s return to around $80 per barrel is temporary, a product of  Russian and Saudi production cuts announced over the past few weeks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMore recently, concerns about oil demand have outweighed the production news.However, while it may prove difficult for oil prices to re-hit $90, $100, or even more per barrel, the supply issue could help to keep prices elevated, and not only because of cuts from OPEC+ members. Decreasing oil drilling rig counts point to decreased domestic production down the road.If worries about demand cease to outweigh tightening oil supplies, even these seven oversold energy stocks could soar. Let’s take a look, and see what makes each of them great opportunities at current prices.Callon Petroleum (CPE)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comCallon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE) is E&amp;P company headquartered in (where else?) Houston, Texas.Callon’s oil and natural gas operating assets are located primarily in the Delaware and Midland basins that are within the famed Permian basin in West Texas.Unlike many other oil &amp; gas names, CPE stock has not joined in on the recent rally. As a result, shares continue to trade at a lower valuation (5 times forward earnings) compared to peers (most of which sport multiples in the high single-digits). So, what makes Callon one of the energy stocks to buy? Sentiment may soon improve.As InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto has pointed out, analysts at Citi have upgraded CPE shares. In their upgrade, the analysts cited several factors, including greater-than-expected success from a recent acquisition, that could enable the stock (at around $36.50 per share today) to make its way towards $45 per share.Story continuesDHT Holdings (DHT)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. AI Recommended Energy Stocks in JulySource: PopTika / ShutterstockAt first glance, it’s hard to argue that DHT Holdings (NYSE:DHT) is one of the oversold energy stocks. Up by more than 23.5% over the past year, shares in this Bermuda-based oil tanker operator appear to trade at a price reflective of the “boom and bust” nature of this space.However, investors could be pricing-in too much uncertainty into DHT stock. Very large crude carrier (or VLCC) tanker rates have stayed elevated this year. This has enabled the company to both keep paying out its 14.43% dividend, as well as engage in share repurchase efforts.That’s not all. Long-term trends for VLCC rates look very favorable. Even if this cannot translate into a big move higher for DHT, if these trends enable the tanker owner to maintain (or even raise) its high payout, this energy stock could produce strong returns for your portfolio.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is another energy play that hasn’t exactly joined in on the sector rally.Shares in this Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based E&amp;P firm are down 22.6% over the past twelve months. Admittedly, a big reason for this is that Devon has historically been focused more on natural gas production than on crude oil production.With natural gas prices not rallying like crude oil prices have recently, it makes sense why DVN stock has merely tread water in recent months.However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently pointed out, the company’s focus has shifted. In recent years, Devon has increased its exposure to crude oil.This leaves the company poised for growth in the coming years. Besides fueling share price appreciation, improved results may also mean higher base dividends as well. DVN’s base payout currently gives it a forward yield of just 1.61%.Ecopetrol (EC)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comBased in the Latin American nation of Colombia, Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) is one of the riskier oil and gas stocks. This may work to your advantage if you can stomach the jurisdictional risks.Since 2022, political headwinds (including Colombia’s election of an anti-oil president) have weighed on shares.As a result, EC stock has become one of the oversold energy stocks. Shares today trade for just 5.5 times earnings. Shareholders have also received in more recent quarters a dividend totaling around 83 cents per share.Even if future dividends come in lower than this amount, the stock could still sport a double-digit forward yield.Even when accounting for high uncertainty, EC’s low valuation and high yield more than make up for it. Tread carefully, but if you’ve been looking for a high-risk, high potential return type of energy play, Ecopetrol is one of your best choices.Vaalco Energy (EGY)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. Bargain energy stocks for JuneSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comVaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is an oil name that I’ve previously cited as one of the top dividend-paying energy stocks. I remain bullish on Vaalco, which engages in energy exploration and production mainly in emerging markets, and not just because of oil price trends.Whether because of its small size, or that it is exposed to riskier oil-producing countries, Vaalco sports a low valuation. You can buy EGY stock today for less than 5 times earnings. However, the company has been steadily profitable, and a recent merger has helped to diversify political risk.Based on its current quarterly dividend, EGY remains a high-yielder, with a forward annualized yield of around 5.4%.As Vaalco wrings out cost savings from its aforementioned merger, the resultant jump in earnings could draw more attention to this under-the-radar energy stock, helping it to finally receive a much-deserved market re-rating.Sitio Royalties (STR)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comSitio Royalties (NYSE:STR) owns a portfolio of mineral and royalty interests. These interests are located in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and other oil-rich basins.Despite booming crude oil prices, STR stock is yet another name that hasn’t joined in on the fun. Shares have traded sideways in recent months.Earlier this month, disappointing quarterly results placed pressure on shares. Still, rather than being held down for good reason, my view is that Sitio is one of the oversold energy stocks.Even with the earnings miss (due to one-time charges), the long-term prospects for this financially-savvy energy company remain strong. At least, based upon the fact Sitio continues to pursue and close on accretive acquisitions.Coupled with oil prices staying elevated, this may enable STR to re-raise its dividend back to 2022 levels (72 cents per quarter, which would give the stock a double-digit yield at current prices).Vital Energy (VTLE)Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.Source: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.comVital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) is a more obscure E&amp;P stock. The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based energy company is more natural gas-focused than oil-focused.Again, like with Devon Energy, this has prevented the sort of rally that more oil-focused energy stock has experienced lately.While up nearly 20% year-to-date, VTLE stock is down by more than 20% over the past twelve months. However, it may today still be in oversold territory. Even after its recent run-up, Vital trades for only 3.2 times forward earnings. Earnings per share are expected to grow in both 2024 and 2025.If you are worried that Vital Energy is a possible value trap, consider that investor Michael Burry recently added it to his portfolio, as InvestorPlace’s Shrey Dua reported Aug. 15.While I wouldn’t buy it just because Burry has bought it, this factor does help to bolster its deep value bona fides.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the AnnouncementMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts.Global equities were poised to conclude August with their poorest monthly performance in 2023 thus far, reported Reuters. The MSCI's broad index of worldwide shares, represented by (.MIWD00000PUS), increased by 0.2%. This positive trend aligned with Asia's markets benefiting from China's efforts to boost its struggling stock market and weak U.S. job data released on Tuesday, which suggested that the Federal Reserve might stop raising interest rates. European shares (.STOXX) also gained modestly on Wednesday, and the measure of Asian shares (.MIAPJ0000PUS) went up by 0.35%. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei (.N225), reached its highest point in over two weeks. Wall Street also joined the optimistic trend, as all three major stock indexes surged on Tuesday. Notably, the data on U.S. job openings for July showed the lowest level in almost two and a half years. This drop indicated that the tight job market was easing inflation pressures and that companies were adjusting their strategies ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting scheduled for September 19.European bond markets experienced a decline in response to recent German inflation data, contributing to a fluctuating market environment on August 30. Alongside this, stocks and US equity futures faced challenges, and Treasury yields underwent a minor dip. The release of economic data from the US led to a reduction in expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes in 2023. Notably, European bonds showed a slip in value, indicating that inflation might not fully retreat in the eurozone. The 10-year yield in Germany surged by as much as five basis points, reaching 2.56%, prompted by the consumer price index's rise in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant indicator. Further reports unveiled an uptick in prices in two other states, even as inflation subsided in two regions. This trend also extended to Spain, where inflation also accelerated. The interconnectedness of these factors underscores the intricate dynamics at play in the global economic landscape, affecting various financial instruments and markets.Story continuesOil prices have slightly increased on August 30, reaching their highest point in over a week, as traders anticipate forthcoming data that could reveal a significant reduction in US oil inventories. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has experienced a fifth consecutive day of gains, nearing the $82 per barrel mark. This streak of gains is the longest since March. Notably, commercial inventories in the US declined by a substantial 11.5 million barrels, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry-funded organization. If this reduction is confirmed by official data expected later on August 30, it would mark the sixth decrease in inventories over the past seven weeks. These developments underscore the ongoing market focus on inventory levels, which can have notable implications for oil prices and market sentiment.Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), and NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street analysts.

With the stock trading at $105.57, it recorded a notable surge of 1.4%.

Moreover, Wells Fargo Securities believes that the shares of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) are currently undervalued, signaling a potential for future appreciation. This shift in assessment underscores the analysts' changing perspective on the company's prospects. The updated price target of $317, up from $290, aligns with the new Equal Weight rating, indicating a more balanced outlook than the previous Underweight rating.Artisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is a leading provider of industrial automation technology. The company has a strong brand, installed base and distribution network and is expanding its product offering to include more cloud-based software to complement its leading hardware business. In the coming years, we expect the company to benefit from an acceleration in US manufacturing investment to support customers’ nearshoring initiatives and in response to federal government incentive programs to manufacture energy transition products domestically. In addition, we expect Rockwell to experience revenue and margin tailwinds in 2023 from easing supply chain constraints, which limited its ability to meet customer demand in 2022.”06.

Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score.

Brands  Taco Bell BlogAt 16 years old, Mauricio began venturing off to the city away from his small town on the lookout for a job. Mauricio remembers that this was the age that young Costa Ricans began their adventure to find their own path for the future. After a long search, he found the job he was looking for: Taco Bell. By the time he decided to apply for the Taco Bell position, the Brand had only been established for about a year in Costa Rica. Now, 33 years later, he is a General Manager for Costa Rica and Panama. Mauricio had no idea that applying for that role was going to make such an incredible impact on his career, life, and community.Throughout his time at Taco Bell, he met his wife through a co-worker, which led them to be the first couple to have a wedding ceremony at the Costa Rica Taco Bell. He and his wife went on to have two children, one of which is deaf - his name is Esteban. When the time came for Mauricio's son Esteban to go to a high school, he and his family were running into challenges looking for a high school that could cater to their son's needs.During his search, he met with his son's Program Coordinator. She asked him if his business had opportunities for people with disabilities. Mauricio responded that the restaurant business is all about speed, etc. and that's why he doesn't have anyone on his team with disabilities. And that's when she said, ""Your response is why my students are unable to find a job."" That's when it hit him; he finally came face-to-face with the fact that his son was going to be entering a world that excluded him. That's when he decided to offer three individuals with disabilities a job at his restaurant. And it didn't take him long to realize that their determination and hard work were like nothing he'd ever seen.The challenge of not finding an opportunity for his son to attend a high school opened his eyes to the challenges that a lot of people with disabilities face each day. That shift in perspective and the experience he had with his new hires led him to work with his franchisee, Jose Pacheco, to start their own program: Inclusion Sin Limites (Inclusion without Limits), which has now been around for over 13 years. It provides jobs within their restaurants to those with physical, cognitive, or hearing disabilities, allowing them to integrate into society like any other person. Today, 10% of their Team Members have some sort of disability and their goal is to reach 15% by end of 2023.""The community has embraced this program and the media in Costa Rica sees Taco Bell as a leading example in their country to provide opportunities,"" Mauricio said. ""&amp;hellip; families that have someone with disabilities tend to fall into poverty, because of the lack of resources. I strongly believe that these types of programs help address our poverty percentage. And I believe that the reason why this program has succeeded was that it did not start as a social movement, but as a teachable moment to show others that people with disabilities were just like the rest of us.""His passion for this work helped set a movement to address inclusiveness in the food industry throughout his country. Over the course of these 13+ years, Mauricio has helped countless individuals have a fair opportunity and hopes that everyone has a chance at a better life.""We should all question if our jobs will be ready to accept us [if we ever got a physical, cognitive, or hearing disability]. If not, then you should be wondering what you can do to make your workplace inclusive,"" he said.There are 240 million children living with disabilities in the world; half of them are out of school, many are invisible, hidden by their families and abandoned by their governments.

289,f1e4f78f-b455-3a73-8785-8f45482eaf2b,YUM,2023-08-30,These Are the ONLY 7 Restaurant Stocks to Consider in August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-7-restaurant-stocks-consider-193417021.html,1692819257,STORY,"['MCD', 'SHAK', 'DENN', 'PZZA', 'TAST', 'YUM', 'PLAY']","[With consumers still hurting despite inflation moving in the right direction (down), the concept of top restaurant stocks to buy might seem a tad too risky. Nevertheless, contrarian investors may be able to benefit from certain air pockets in the economy.First, the AP reported that retail sales increased a better-than-expected 0.7% in July, as compared to the prior month. This data point demonstrates that even with consumers feeling the pressure, they’re still opening their wallets. That’s a broadly positive sign for the best restaurant stocks to buy. Second, not all eateries are obviously the same. Some enterprises that focus on low-priced comfort food and beverages may perform quite well. That’s especially the case if social trends return to full normal.With that, below are intriguing restaurant stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRestaurant Stocks: McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockA fast-food icon, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) makes a strong case for top restaurant stocks to buy. Aside from high-end events, the Golden Arches fill many everyday needs. For example, when you’re on a road trip and you have nowhere else to go, it’s usually a safe bet that a McDonald’s will be open (or at least its drive-thru will be). In some ways, then, McDonald’s is almost an infrastructural play.However, the main reason to target MCD centers on its potential to steal market share from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). If the consumer economy continues to come under pressure, I don’t think your average household can afford to continue forking over premium dollars for Starbucks coffee. Instead, they’ll trade down, which would benefit low-cost operator McDonald’s.Another top reason to target MCD is institutional options flow. Throughout August, institutional traders appear to have made big block trades favoring MCD. In the most recent sessions, traders have sold put options, which carry an optimistic framework.Story continuesPapa John’s (PZZA)Billboard From Papa John's At Amsterdam East The NetherlandsSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.comOne of the top pizza joints, Papa John’s (NASDAQ:PZZA) had a bit of a public relations nightmare a few years back. I’m not going to rehash the controversy but suffice to say, management made significant efforts to restore the brand. Since the Jan. opener, PZZA slipped more than 4%. Nevertheless, the institutional traders want to give Papa John’s the benefit of the doubt.Throughout the month of August, data from Fintel shows movement for big block trades, specifically involving sold puts. To quickly recap, put options provide stakeholders the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at the listed strike price. Buying puts has negative implications. By logical deduction, selling puts carries positive implications.During the Aug. 21 session, traders sold PZZA puts with a strike price of $67.50 and an expiration date of Oct. 20. It’s unlikely that PZZA – which presently stands at $75.69 – will fall that low. Therefore, it’s a subtle indication that the institutional players believe in PZZA.Restaurant Stocks: Dave &amp; Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY)Dave &amp; Buster's (PLAY) logo on a windowSource: Jeff Bukowski/Shutterstock.comA restaurant and entertainment business, Dave &amp; Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) stood as a hallmark of the pre-pandemic work ecosystem. It wasn’t at all unusual for people to attend happy hours at Dave &amp; Buster’s to let off some steam. Obviously, the Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent work-from-home directive changed circumstances. However, if the remote operation narrative pivots back to the old normal, PLAY could be due for big gains.So far, the market appears to be warming to the concept. Since the Jan. opener, shares gained over 13% of equity value. However, they still stand at a discount if you’re looking for undervalued restaurant stocks to buy. For instance, PLAY trades at 5.11x operating cash flow, below the sector median of 9.98x.However, a more compelling argument is institutional trading. On Aug. 16, traders bought call options in a multi-sweep transaction or orders across multiple exchanges simultaneously. Further, the strike price on these options – which expire on Nov. 17, 2023 – sits at $40. Given that shares are trading at $40.18, this call can potentially rise in value.Yum! Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBased in Louisville, Kentucky, Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) operates several fan favorites, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell (well, some folks must like it) and The Habit Burger Grill. Of course, the exception here is China. If you want exposure to that market for the aforementioned brands, you must buy Yum China (NYSE:YUMC). However, with the world’s second-largest economy also suffering challenges, it might make sense to invest domestically.Interestingly, the alpha dogs of Wall Street may have the same idea. On Aug. 17, traders initiated a multi-sweep transaction for YUM calls. These options feature a strike price of $130 and an expiration date of Sept. 15, 2023. Currently, YUM trades hands at $129.45 after losing more than 6% of equity value in the trailing month. However, more recent trades appear encouraging for bulls, possibly making YUM one of the best restaurant stocks. Finally, Yum features strong revenue growth and high-profit margins. Even if a recession hits, the company’s low-cost leaders should keep the corporate umbrella afloat.Restaurant Stocks: Denny’s (DENN)outside of a denny's restaurantSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKnown as America’s diner, Denny’s (NASDAQ:DENN) is an important cog in the consumer ecosystem. No, it’s not exactly what you call a Michelin-star restaurant. However, when you’re looking for something to eat because every other place is closed, (many) Denny’s locations fill that gap. Also, should full normalization materialize in the workplace, the diner may see a resurgence in demand.If I’m reading the tea leaves correctly, some institutional traders have the same idea. Specifically, on Aug. 2, traders sold put options in a multi-sweep transaction. Specifically, these puts expire on Sept. 15, 2023, and have a strike price of $10. At the moment, DENN trades hands at $9.86. But given that DENN swung up over 3% on Tuesday, there’s a good chance that the put sellers will be able to keep their premium.On the financials, Denny’s could use improvements in the top line. However, it’s consistently profitable, commanding a trailing-year operating margin of 13.23%. In contrast, the sector median sits at only 3.25%. In addition, DENN trades at a discounted forward multiple of 15.91x.Shake Shack (SHAK)The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USASource: Here Now / Shutterstock.comOne of the top restaurant stocks to buy based on market performance, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) has, so far, expertly climbed the wall of worry impacting many other discretionary consumer plays. Since the beginning of this year, SHAK gained almost 70% of its equity value. In the trailing one-year period, shares moved up nearly 44%. Still, it’s a tricky narrative. For example, in the past five sessions, SHAK slipped about 7%.If you can handle the risk, SHAK could be one of the best restaurant stocks to put on your radar. That’s because the institutional traders seem to like it. On Aug. 17, Fintel reported big block trades for $77.50 SHAK calls with an expiration date of Sept. 15, 2023. Unfortunately, the recent losses have forced SHAK conspicuously out of the money. Still, there’s a chance here, with shares gaining 3% on Tuesday.Financially, SHAK is a risk because of the lack of consistent profitability. However, for a near-term trade, it could be interesting.Carrols Restaurant (TAST)A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant.Source: Savvapanf Photo/ShutterStock.comWhile Carrols Restaurant (NASDAQ:TAST) might not be a household name, its top brands certainly are. Per its public profile, Carrols is the largest Burger King franchisee in the world. It also owns and operates 55 Popeyes restaurants. If you doubt that consumers are spending so much at retailers, just look at TAST stock. It gained almost 400% of its equity value since the start of the year.And the really crazy part? The institutional folks seem to believe that more upside could be on the way. On Aug. 10, Fintel reported big block trades for $6 TAST calls. At the time the trade was carried out, TAST had a spot price of $7.625. Given that these options are in the money, TAST will need to move a bit more to be net profitable. Still, with momentum at its back, who’s going to question it?In the spirit of full disclosure, its financials aren’t great. However, in the second quarter, Carrols’ $485 million in sales represented an increase of nearly 10% year-over-year.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Prologis in FocusBased in San Francisco, Prologis (PLD) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 10%. The industrial real estate developer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.87 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.81%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.84% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.66%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.48 is up 10.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Prologis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.43%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Prologis's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.PLD is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 8.33%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PLD is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

XRT currently holds 80 stocks invested across $38.7 billion in net assets. The top three sub-industries by weight are apparel retail (23.19%), automotive retail (22.41%), and other specialty retail (21.83%). InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s been downhill for retail stocks since November 2021. The ETF has dramatically underperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past five years. XRT has a 24.1% return, less than half the index’s return over the same period. Now is a good time to bet that some of the holdings will be the leading retail stocks for 2024. I’ll select a small, mid, and large-cap stock for my trio to make it interesting. They’ll all be from XRT’s 80 holdings.  Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) stock is down more than 3% year-to-date. However, over the past five years, it’s up 143%, almost three-fold better than the S&amp;P 500. I first recommended the rural lifestyle retailer’s stock in September 2014. “TSCO is one of the most consistent retailers I know. Over the past decade, it has increased revenues every year and operating income in all but one. With more than 1300 stores in 48 states, it has delivered 25 consecutive quarters of comparable transaction count. In other words, traffic’s not letting up, and customers continue to buy more,” I wrote in 2014. Fast forward to 2023. It has 2,181 stores at the moment, with plans to grow the number to 3,000, adding approximately 80 stores in 2024 and 90 stores a year after that. At the end of the second quarter, it had more than 31 million members in its Neighbors Club rewards program. It added 5 million over the past year alone. Story continuesThe company lowered its 2023 guidance at the end of July. It now expects net sales of at least $14.8 billion, down from $15.0 billion. Same-store sales growth of 1.9% at the midpoint of its previous guidance, down 210 basis points. However, its earnings per share will only be 15 cents lower at $10.30. To finance this accelerated growth, it plans to do sale-leaseback transactions on 117 stores it owns. That’s an intelligent capital allocation decision, in my opinion. I continue to like TSCO stock, and that’s among the aforementioned reasons why it made my top retail stocks to watch this year. Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A photo of three women walking by a Bath&amp;Body Works storefront.Bath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) is another retailer whose share price has floundered in 2023. BBWI is down nearly 15% year-to-date (YTD). The specialty retailer provides customers with liquid hand soaps, body lotions, candles, home fragrance diffusers, and more. It was part of L Brands until August 2021, when it and its stable mate, Victoria’s Secret &amp; Co. (NYSE:VSCO), were separated into two independent, publicly-traded companies. L Brands ceased to exist after the separation, with shareholders getting one VSCO share for every three BBWI shares. While Bath &amp; Body Works did incredibly well during the pandemic, its spending became excessive, forcing activist investor Third Point LLC — who owns 6% of the company — to push for change. The company added veteran financial banking executive Thomas Kuhn to its board, and Third Point backed off. In 2022, the company hired Unilever (NYSE:UL) veteran Gina Boswell as its CEO. Third Point has invested in BBWI because it feels a turnaround in its earnings story will deliver a premium valuation in the future. What should also help is a resurgence in retail. Barclays is bullish about the industry in 2024. On Aug. 1, it upgraded its rating for retail to “positive” from “neutral”.  “We believe the demand backdrop in 2024 will improve as inflationary and rising interest rate pressures on the consumer potentially subside,” said Barron’s report of Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih’s comments to clients. At the same time, Yih upgraded BBWI to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $4 increase in her price target to $45, 23% higher than where it’s currently trading. Hibbett (HIBB)An outside view of a Hibbett Sports storefrontSource: LisaCarter / Shutterstock.comHibbett (NASDAQ:HIBB) is the small-cap stock of the trio of top retail stocks to watch. Its stock is down 37% YTD. However, it’s up nearly 107% over the past five years. Although I don’t believe I’ve ever recommended the sporting goods retailer for InvestorPlace, I’ve followed the Alabama company for many years. It’s a very streaky stock. Buying while it’s down makes total sense. The retailer’s history dates back to 1945. Today, it has 1,143 stores spread across three banners: Hibbett (939), City Gear (188), and Sports Additions (16). In Q1 2024, it reported same-store sales growth of 4.1%, revenue of $455.5 million, and net income of $35.9 million, down from $39.3 million a year earlier. Gross margins were the culprit, 330 basis points lower due to higher promotional activity. While it lowered its 2024 outlook in May due to a challenging business environment, it still plans to open between 30 and 40 stores this year. “Notwithstanding our more cautious near-term consumer outlook, we believe Hibbett remains well positioned for the long-term to continue to grow and increase market share,” stated CEO Mike Longo in the Q1 2024 press release. Hibbett reports Q2 2024 results on Aug. 25. I would wait until after it reports earnings. Do not hesitate to buy should its share price fall on the news.Long-term, it’s a winner.   On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

302,93cb8dda-b8c7-3b12-9ee2-54960c7a386f,OXY,2023-08-30,7 Stocks Warren Buffett is Buying Hand Over Fist,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-buying-203859537.html,1692823139,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'COF', 'OXY', 'BRK-B', 'LEN-B']","[Warren Buffett has a knack for finding great companies selling at bargain levels. He’s consistently picked winners for years by targeting quality stocks when they hit a rough patch. Even with the recent market turbulence, Buffett can still dig up deals in 2023. Though he plays some moves close to the chest, looking at Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) latest high-conviction buys gives insight into where the investing legend is putting his money to work.Of course, that doesn’t mean that he isn’t into momentum plays. He’s been scooping up homebuilder stocks lately, and they have been on a tear. Unfortunately, Berkshire’s portfolio includes a lag of around two months or more, so Warren Buffett is already sitting on some hefty gains on the homebuilder stocks. Common sense says a plateau could be near for such stocks.Again, by the time you read this, many of these Warren Buffett stocks have gone up considerably, and Berkshire may have changed positions on some of them. While Buffett is a great investor, I recommend you form your own conclusions based on their current valuations. I am simply stating the facts here, so don’t shoot the messenger!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWhile oil prices have pulled back over the last few months, I believe crude could be nearing a bottom here, with some speculators betting oil may surge back up to $90 per barrel again soon. However, this short-term oil price fluctuation isn’t the only rationale behind Warren Buffett’s purchase of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Buffett has been notably bullish on OXY stock for quite some time now. Much of that appears to be due to the fact that Occidental boasts substantial operations in several oil-rich locations that offer massive growth opportunities ahead.Admittedly, investing in oil companies is controversial, as the rise of clean energy has led many investors to avoid the traditional energy sector entirely. That said, I think OXY stock still offers compelling value here, especially considering its recent underperformance versus other oil majors. On its latest earnings call, Occidental’s management team emphasized that the company possesses a diverse, high-quality asset portfolio that continues to churn out record free cash flows quarter after quarter. Its unique mix of unconventional and conventional resources provides resilience across commodity cycles. Occidental is also making great strides in low-carbon ventures that can create additional shareholder value over the long term.Story continuesSo while the future of oil certainly faces some uncertainty, Buffett likely sees significant upside potential still in OXY stock. The company is delivering operationally and financially, plus it offers exposure to future oil price upside if crude markets tighten global inventories. He increased his positions here by 5% to $13.2 billion, his biggest buy last quarter.DR Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHomebuilder stocks like DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) have exploded higher over the past year, so it’s no surprise that Warren Buffett has moved to scoop up names like this. Conditions have recently become quite favorable for leading homebuilders, with low existing home inventory levels combined with the normalization of previous pandemic-related supply chain challenges. That powerful combination helps explain why DR Horton and its peers have shined in 2023, despite ongoing concerns about a potential broader economic slowdown.DR Horton reported very strong Q3 results, including a 37% jump in net orders compared to the same quarter last year. While margins retreated moderately from the unprecedented peaks achieved last year, they are gradually recovering now as both home prices and the level of buyer incentives have stabilized considerably. The company also specifically noted that construction cycle times are decreasing as the availability of materials and labor continues to improve incrementally. With the extremely limited housing supply still constraining the overall market, there could be further momentum ahead for DR Horton’s business. Thanks to its diverse product mix and leading market share position, DR Horton remains well-positioned to continue gaining more market share in this significant housing supply-demand imbalance. Berkshire Hathaway added $726.4 million of DHI stock to its stash.Capital One (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comWhile major financial stocks overall stumbled along with the broader market in 2022, Capital One’s (NYSE:COF) tempting valuation after its pullback likely drew Warren Buffett in to build a position. In particular, Capital One’s generous capital return program, including both a solid dividend and very aggressive share buybacks, makes the stock tough for value investors like Buffett to ignore. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, COF has already repurchased $150 million of its own shares.However, Capital One is not immune to the increased economic uncertainty, as evidenced by its Q2 earnings results showing moderately higher loan losses. Credit card charge-offs are gradually normalizing from the unusually low levels witnessed during the pandemic period. Yet, per management’s commentary on the latest quarterly earnings call, aggregate credit quality remains quite solid for Capital One, for now at least, particularly in its most recent vintages of newly originated loans and credit card accounts. While it’s unclear exactly how long the current economic slowdown may last, Capital One is prudently leaning into growth opportunities in several key areas, like continuing to expand its digital bank and further growing its core credit card business. Though some nagging near-term headwinds do persist, Capital One’s ongoing investment in modern technology capabilities could ultimately drive greater efficiency and enduring shareholder value creation over the longer term. Berkshire Hathaway boosted its holdings in COF stock by 25% to $1.34 billion.Lennar (LEN)Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockWith homebuilder stocks surging over the past year amid favorable housing market conditions, it’s certainly no shock that Warren Buffett has moved to snatch up shares of homebuilding names like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) lately. LEN stock vaulted over 40% higher over the past year, as the entire homebuilder group has shone brightly during that period. Though Buffett didn’t take as substantial a position in Lennar as some of the other homebuilder buys, it remains a compelling pure play on the ongoing major housing shortage in America.According to its latest quarterly earnings release, Lennar saw Q2 revenue of $8 billion, which beat estimates by almost $800 million. While gross margins slid moderately from the unprecedented peaks achieved in the previous year, margins are gradually recovering now as Lennar has proactively cut costs and strategically stabilized home prices. Lennar’s management team expressed confidence on their earrings call that they can continue driving consistent financial performance and operational excellence from the business going forward. They remain laser-focused on maintaining healthy sales volume and pace while simultaneously maximizing returns and operational efficiency across the board. With the ongoing major housing supply deficits likely continuing to support strong fundamental demand for the foreseeable future, perhaps Buffett sees potential for significant additional upside still ahead for this best-in-class homebuilder. He added $17.24 million of the stock to his holdings.NVR (NVR)Person holding smartphone with logo of US distribution company Univar Solutions Inc. (UNVR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comRounding out Warren Buffett’s series of investments in homebuilder stocks recently is NVR (NYSE:NVR), which has also generated stellar returns for shareholders over the past year.In its latest Q2 earnings release, NVR reported a 27% year-over-year increase in net new orders, showcasing the strength of current demand trends. While overall Q2 revenues dropped 12.5% annually, net income only fell by 7% annually as NVR’s profit margins generally held up quite well. Looking ahead, NVR continues directing its focus on key strategic initiatives like turning inventory faster, continuing to pay down debt, and repurchasing its own shares to further boost shareholder returns.Admittedly, some lingering headwinds do persist for the housing sector, including still-high mortgage rates and intense inflationary pressures. However, strong fundamental demand combined with historically limited supply should allow efficient homebuilders like NVR to keep consolidating market share and generating impressive earnings in this constructive environment. While a potential recession could pose some risks, the company’s rock-solid balance sheet provides plenty of financial flexibility looking ahead.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIf you have already seen Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio additions, you may wonder where this came from since Berkshire Hathaway only reported five major buys in the recent report.

This allows him to build sizable positions in companies under the radar.Starting with Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), this was a surprising purchase, given its lackluster performance over the past few years. But upon closer inspection, I believe Buffett sees a compelling turnaround opportunity.

They expect improving volume trends in the back half as pricing moderates and new product launches gain traction. I’m encouraged by KHC’s renewed focus on revitalizing core brands through R&amp;D. With the stock trading at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 11.5-times, this looks like a classic Buffett value play.CMS Energy (CMS)Image of a person holding a lit lightbulbSource: ShutterstockCMS Energy (NYSE:CMS) is a steady dividend payer that Warren Buffett likely sees as undervalued at current levels. The stock has drifted lower in recent months on macro concerns, but CMS offers stability with its focus on regulated utility operations.The company’s Q2 results were acceptable, with adjusted earnings per share beating estimates. Management reaffirmed full-year earnings per share guidance toward the higher end of the range, signaling confidence in their financial plan.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Prestige Consumer Healthcare and Boston Scientific are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that PBH's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.88, while BSX has a forward P/E of 27. We also note that PBH has a PEG ratio of 1.73. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.11.Another notable valuation metric for PBH is its P/B ratio of 2. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BSX has a P/B of 4.07.These metrics, and several others, help PBH earn a Value grade of B, while BSX has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesPBH sticks out from BSX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PBH is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Should You?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-bids-adieu-3-023618204.html,1692844578,STORY,"['COF', 'BABA', 'DVN']","[Michael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, parted ways with three significant stocks – leaving many to ask: Should we follow his lead? Perhaps. First on the list of Michael Burry stocks is a Chinese e-commerce giant that once seemed invincible. Unfortunately, it now faces many challenges which could greatly impact its revenue.Another one of the top Michael Burry stocks being sold is deeply entrenched in the volatile world of oil and gas. It finds itself at the mercy of fluctuating prices and a global push towards cleaner energy alternatives. Finally, the third is battling rising delinquency and charge-off rates. All of which we’ll discuss in greater detail.Michael Burry Stocks: Alibaba (BABA)baba value stocksSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.comThe Chinese government’s increased regulatory scrutiny and potential antitrust measures could significantly limit Alibaba’s (NYSE:BABA) market dominance. Further, the ongoing uncertainties related to the post-COVID economic recovery could impact consumer spending and overall business growth. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso, while Alibaba Cloud has shown growth in revenue and potential in AI services, intensifying competition from other global cloud service providers could limit its market share expansion and put pressure on margins. The departure of Alibaba’s long-standing CEO, Daniel Zhang, could lead to transitional challenges and potential disruptions, as well. No wonder this is one of the top Michael Burry stocks to exit.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is greatly exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices, which can significantly impact its revenues and profitability. Further, the global shift towards renewable energy sources could have long-term implications for oil and gas companies like Devon Energy. As governments and markets prioritize cleaner energy alternatives, demand for fossil fuels could decline over time.Story continuesGlobally, investor sentiment towards the oil and gas sector is changing rapidly. It is influenced by factors such as ESG (environmental, social, and governance) considerations and shifting investment preferences. If investors increasingly favor companies with strong ESG profiles or divest from fossil fuel industries, it could impact Devon’s stock performance and access to capital.Rapid technological advancements, such as breakthroughs in extraction techniques or energy storage solutions, could reshape the energy landscape. If new technologies make unconventional oil and gas extraction less competitive or accelerate the adoption of renewables, Devon Energy’s asset portfolio and business model could become less valuable.Capital One (COF)capital one (COF) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.comCapital One (NYSE:COF) has seen a significant increase in delinquency and charge-off rates. If these trends persist, it could lead to higher provisions for loan losses, impacting the bank’s profitability and capital.The consumer banking segment is also experiencing declining auto originations, leading to decreased ending loans. Lower auto originations suggest weakening consumer demand or tighter lending standards, which could hinder the segment’s growth prospects. Additionally, increased auto charge-off and delinquency rates could signal financial stress among consumers, potentially leading to higher credit losses.Furthermore, the commercial banking segment has witnessed a decline in ending loan balances and deposits, driven by tightened credit standards and loan movements. The transition of loans to being held for sale and the decrease in deposits indicate businesses’ decreased demand for credit and potential economic uncertainty. Moreover, the increase in the annualized charge-off rate in the commercial banking segment points to heightened credit risk among commercial clients.Additionally, Capital One acknowledges the need to monitor competitors’ actions and potential marketplace risks. Therefore, shifts in the competitive environment could impact its growth strategy.Looking forward, Capital One’s allowance for loan losses has increased in certain segments due to changes in the economic outlook and loan growth. This suggests that the bank is anticipating potential credit losses in the future. The fact that the economic outlook assumes worsening conditions, albeit less severe than previously projected, indicates potential concerns about economic stability and credit quality.As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos was long BABA.

307,93cb8dda-b8c7-3b12-9ee2-54960c7a386f,COF,2023-08-30,7 Stocks Warren Buffett is Buying Hand Over Fist,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-buying-203859537.html,1692823139,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'COF', 'OXY', 'BRK-B', 'LEN-B']","[Warren Buffett has a knack for finding great companies selling at bargain levels. He’s consistently picked winners for years by targeting quality stocks when they hit a rough patch. Even with the recent market turbulence, Buffett can still dig up deals in 2023. Though he plays some moves close to the chest, looking at Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) latest high-conviction buys gives insight into where the investing legend is putting his money to work.Of course, that doesn’t mean that he isn’t into momentum plays. He’s been scooping up homebuilder stocks lately, and they have been on a tear. Unfortunately, Berkshire’s portfolio includes a lag of around two months or more, so Warren Buffett is already sitting on some hefty gains on the homebuilder stocks. Common sense says a plateau could be near for such stocks.Again, by the time you read this, many of these Warren Buffett stocks have gone up considerably, and Berkshire may have changed positions on some of them. While Buffett is a great investor, I recommend you form your own conclusions based on their current valuations. I am simply stating the facts here, so don’t shoot the messenger!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWhile oil prices have pulled back over the last few months, I believe crude could be nearing a bottom here, with some speculators betting oil may surge back up to $90 per barrel again soon. However, this short-term oil price fluctuation isn’t the only rationale behind Warren Buffett’s purchase of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Buffett has been notably bullish on OXY stock for quite some time now. Much of that appears to be due to the fact that Occidental boasts substantial operations in several oil-rich locations that offer massive growth opportunities ahead.Admittedly, investing in oil companies is controversial, as the rise of clean energy has led many investors to avoid the traditional energy sector entirely. That said, I think OXY stock still offers compelling value here, especially considering its recent underperformance versus other oil majors. On its latest earnings call, Occidental’s management team emphasized that the company possesses a diverse, high-quality asset portfolio that continues to churn out record free cash flows quarter after quarter. Its unique mix of unconventional and conventional resources provides resilience across commodity cycles. Occidental is also making great strides in low-carbon ventures that can create additional shareholder value over the long term.Story continuesSo while the future of oil certainly faces some uncertainty, Buffett likely sees significant upside potential still in OXY stock. The company is delivering operationally and financially, plus it offers exposure to future oil price upside if crude markets tighten global inventories. He increased his positions here by 5% to $13.2 billion, his biggest buy last quarter.DR Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHomebuilder stocks like DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) have exploded higher over the past year, so it’s no surprise that Warren Buffett has moved to scoop up names like this. Conditions have recently become quite favorable for leading homebuilders, with low existing home inventory levels combined with the normalization of previous pandemic-related supply chain challenges. That powerful combination helps explain why DR Horton and its peers have shined in 2023, despite ongoing concerns about a potential broader economic slowdown.DR Horton reported very strong Q3 results, including a 37% jump in net orders compared to the same quarter last year. While margins retreated moderately from the unprecedented peaks achieved last year, they are gradually recovering now as both home prices and the level of buyer incentives have stabilized considerably. The company also specifically noted that construction cycle times are decreasing as the availability of materials and labor continues to improve incrementally. With the extremely limited housing supply still constraining the overall market, there could be further momentum ahead for DR Horton’s business. Thanks to its diverse product mix and leading market share position, DR Horton remains well-positioned to continue gaining more market share in this significant housing supply-demand imbalance. Berkshire Hathaway added $726.4 million of DHI stock to its stash.Capital One (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comWhile major financial stocks overall stumbled along with the broader market in 2022, Capital One’s (NYSE:COF) tempting valuation after its pullback likely drew Warren Buffett in to build a position. In particular, Capital One’s generous capital return program, including both a solid dividend and very aggressive share buybacks, makes the stock tough for value investors like Buffett to ignore. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, COF has already repurchased $150 million of its own shares.However, Capital One is not immune to the increased economic uncertainty, as evidenced by its Q2 earnings results showing moderately higher loan losses.

308,4e52e038-2b9e-3bc2-8015-92171d05f992,ULTA,2023-08-30,Ulta (ULTA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-ulta-incredible-growth-stock-164504279.html,1693327504,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this beauty products retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Ulta is 26.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.6%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Ulta is 18.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.4% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Ulta have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.1% over the past month.Bottom LineUlta has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Ulta well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

309,acae9ea0-24b1-312e-a90f-53a1261cbfc8,ULTA,2023-08-30,Holiday discounts will look more like they did pre-pandemic: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/holiday-discounts-look-more-did-162518270.html,1693326318,VIDEO,"['BBY', 'ULTA', 'COST', 'ORLY', 'WMT', 'LOW', 'BJ']","[Best Buy (BBY) reported second quarter results that topped analyst estimates. D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker says that right now, there is a ""more promotional environment"" caused by retailers' desire to get people into the stores. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Baker tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""this holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic,"" with traditional door-buster sales. Overall, Baker says the best positioned retailers are Walmart (WMT), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Costco (COST), who all benefit from the increase in consumers looking for deals. Baker's other top picks include Ulta Beauty (ULTA), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), and Lowe's (LOW).Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: In some of the categories where consumers are continuing to show that they're either looking for a big discount, or waiting for a major sale or promotion to take place, what can you extrapolate from these numbers and apply towards, say, the Labor Day sales, or even further out some of the holiday shopping season sales. Are we going to see major doorbusters, and those deals that consumers have come to expect on a cyclical basis, because there's inventory that needs to be moved through, or just because Best Buy is going to have to do something to entice the customers back into the store here for some of the larger ticket items?MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah sure, a lot there. So it is a more promotional environment, absolutely. We are seeing it more promotional, we expect that over the holiday season. It's more because of the second thing you said, it's just to spur demand and get people to come on in and shop.It's less about inventory. Inventory is actually pretty clean right now, not just for Best Buy, but for a lot of retailers. That was a major issue last year. Most retailers, not all, there's still some pockets of heavy inventory. But most retailers have their inventory well under control. But it is more promotional just to get the consumer to come back in.Story continuesAs relates to Best Buy, the good news is, a lot of it is vendor-funded right now, because the vendors have the same incentive that Best Buy has, and that's to get people back in the store. So it is more promotional than last year. This holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic, which is those traditional doorbusters, and those types of things, those types of call to calls to action.Best Buy did say something interesting on the call today, and that is that some of their back-to-school categories are actually doing better than expected, typically that bodes well for the holiday season. Back-to-school points in the right direction for holiday sales in 85% of the time.BRAD SMITH: And so does that mean that we are to believe, and is expected now that the worst in the tech demand, and that lull is behind US?MICHAEL BAKER: Does feel like that. So we're still down year-over-year. But remember, we were down 10% in the first quarter, and then towards the end of last year. This quarter down 6%, and Best Buy is trending at down 5% in August.Still not out of the woods yet, but getting a little bit better. And Best Buy does think it's possible that holiday sales could be closer to flat. So we are trending in the right direction.There are some interesting green shoots that we heard about, in talking to the company. Laptop units were actually flat year-over-year, that's a good sign. TV units are actually up year-over-year. Gaming was a strong category. So there are definitely some positive signs that we're seeing.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Michael, as we're seeing consumers continue to trade down or trade off, which of the retailers do you think are best positioned, going into the holiday season, and beyond, keeping in mind that we are in an interest rate higher for longer environment.MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah, well bigger picture, we think among the best positioned retailers this holiday season, is Walmart, for sure. They span the spectrum of categories. But when the consumer is trading down, we are seeing some of that. We think Walmart is particularly well positioned in this environment.We think the clubs as well are well-positioned. A name like BJ's has added a lot to their general merchandise offering, and we think that could help their holiday seasons. Costco always does well in that kind of trade down environment as well.BRAD SMITH: And so from an investor perspective here, when you think about some of the top names in retail that investors should be paying close attention to, even amid what Corie Barry, the Best Buy CEO, continues to call a very unfamiliar, or all too familiar macroeconomic environment with several challenges, who would some of those top picks be?MICHAEL BAKER: Well, it's all about expectations and what's already embedded in the stock price. And sometimes the best sales performance doesn't necessarily mean the best stock. But that being said, best ideas, again, Walmart, we think, is particularly well positioned here. We like ALTA on the pullback that we've seen. We think that represents good value for a name-taking market share.Another name that we highlighted as a best idea earlier in the year, and has done particularly well, we haven't really talked about in this conversation, O'Reilly Auto Parts, that space is doing very well. And then the last one we'll throw out is Lowe's, Lowe's has been a particularly good stock this year. For them it's all about closing the margin gap with Home Depot, and through new management over the last couple of years, they've been able to do that.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It certainly makes sense as people try and do more at home with their cars, and with their homes, as well, that those are some of the companies that would also be doing well. A big thank you there to Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst. Thank you for your time this morning.]"

After declining 7.6% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why ULTA Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of ULTA shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.94. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ULTA in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 1.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ULTA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

The firm runs on more than 20,000 miles of track, hauling shipments of coal, intermodal traffic, and a diverse mix of automobile, agriculture, metal, chemical, and forest products. Despite its recent losses, the company's stock price stands at $207.73, with a market capitalization of $47.20 billion. However, the GF Value, a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, estimates the fair value of Norfolk Southern at $310.52. This discrepancy suggests that the stock might be significantly undervalued.Unveiling Norfolk Southern's True Worth: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value provides an estimate of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line, visible on our summary page, represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Given its current price, Norfolk Southern appears to be significantly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Norfolk Southern's True Worth: Is It Really Priced Right?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Coca-Cola (KO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.63.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 indicates a change of +7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $45.01 billion and $47.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +5.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.03%. The EPS surprise was +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CTLT reported preliminary fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 9 cents, down 91.7% from the year-over-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 10 cents.The adjustments include charges related to amortization, and acquisition, integration and other special items’ costs, among others.The company’s GAAP loss per share was 48 cents during the quarter against the year-over-year period’s EPS of 93 cents.Revenues in DetailPer the preliminary report, revenues grossed $1.07 billion in the reported quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.At constant exchange rate or CER, revenues were also down 17%.The top line was hampered by soft performances in its Biologics segment in the reported quarter.Organic net revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation) decreased 19% year over year.Per the preliminary report, full-year revenues were $4.28 billion, reflecting a 10.9% decline from the comparable fiscal 2022 period. However, the figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5%.At CER, revenues were down 9%.Segments in DetailPer Catalent’s new organizational structure, it reports via two segments — Biologics and Pharma and Consumer Health.Per the preliminary report, revenues in the Biologics segment fell 37.1% year over year on a reported basis (down 37% at CER) to $406 million in the quarter under review. This compares to our projection of fiscal fourth-quarter segmental revenues of $518.2 million.Per the preliminary report, revenues in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment increased 2.9% from the year-ago period (up 3% at CER) to $662 million.

QuoteOperational UpdateIn the quarter under review, Catalent’s gross profit fell 49.1% to $235 million. The gross margin contracted a huge 1389 basis points to 22%.Story continuesWe had projected 23% of gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 3.1% to $219 million year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $16 million, reflecting a 93.2% decline from the prior-year quarter’s level. Adjusted operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter contracted a huge 1684 bps to 1.5%.Financial UpdateCatalent exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $280 million compared with $449 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Total debt at the fiscal 2023-end was $4.85 billion compared with $4.20 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of fiscal 2023 was $261 million compared with $439 million a year ago.GuidanceCatalent has initiated its financial outlook for fiscal 2024.The company projects revenues between $4,300 million and $4,500 million for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $4.21 billion.Our TakeCatalent exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings and dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances. The decline in Biologics segment’s revenues during the period was also disappointing. Rising operating costs leading to the contraction of both margins in the quarter do not bode well.On a positive note, Catalent’s better-than-expected revenues in the reported quarter and the year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment were impressive. Management’s confirmation regarding Catalent’s continued progress in improving its operational performance and winning new business with new and existing customers raises our optimism.In June, Catalent expanded its integrated development, manufacturing and supply solution, OneBio Suite, across a range of biologic modalities, including antibody and recombinant proteins, cell and gene therapies, and mRNA. In May, the company expanded the services and capabilities at its facility in Shiga, Japan, to include the storage, kitting, and distribution of advanced therapies at ultra-low temperatures for clinical trials.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is DaVita (DVA). DVA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.40. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.82. Over the past year, DVA's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.73 and as low as 7.30, with a median of 12.59.Investors should also note that DVA holds a PEG ratio of 1.06. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. DVA's industry has an average PEG of 2.30 right now. DVA's PEG has been as high as 1.87 and as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.21, all within the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. DVA has a P/S ratio of 0.78. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.37.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that DVA has a P/CF ratio of 7.72. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. DVA's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 24.64. Over the past 52 weeks, DVA's P/CF has been as high as 8.64 and as low as 4.38, with a median of 5.95.These are just a handful of the figures considered in DaVita's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

Its clean-burning nature steadily boosts demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural gas distribution pipelines are vital in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines.The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 2.3 million miles of underground distribution pipelines. Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and rising investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean energy sources can lower demand for natural gas and, consequently, for pipelines.Story continuesFactors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryAging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may disrupt services. Natural gas distribution utilities currently provide services to over 80 million customers in the United States. Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. Per Playbook.Aga.org, the natural gas utilities invest nearly $32 billion each year to improve the distribution network's safety.To lower the possibility of service interruption, the Department of Energy announced $33 million in funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing cast iron and bare steel pipes. The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile.Currently, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years.Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow to 103 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2023 and increase 1.06% year over year to 104.1 Bcf/d in 2024. The increase in gas production volumes has improved from earlier forecasts of EIA due to strong volumes from the Permian region. Export volumes are expected to increase in 2023 and 2024, providing much relief to natural gas transporters.The EIA expects U.S. gross liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase nearly 12% year over year to 11.9 Bcf/d in 2023, and exports are expected to increase 12.2%  to 13.31 Bcf/d in 2024.  Per the Playbook.AGA.org the United States will reach peak export capacity of 20 Bcf/d by 2025. This indicates the need for more pipelines to send the LNG to the export terminals.Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States are driving demand for natural gas. The distribution network will continue to transport natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. With three new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals.Per the EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. Per the  Playbook.AGA.org, one residential customer signs up for natural gas service every minute and 80 businesses add natural gas service each day. As production and demand for natural gas increase, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the commodity to end-users.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 0.67%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 10.48%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of General Electric Co.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with GE. Click here to check it out. GE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GEGeneral Electric Co (GE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 6/102. Profitability rank: 5/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 1/105. Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned General Electric Co the GF Score of 57 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.General Electric Co: A SnapshotGeneral Electric Co, with a market cap of $123.2 billion, was formed through the combination of two companies in 1892, including one with historical ties to American inventor Thomas Edison. Today, GE is a global leader in air travel and in the energy transition. The company is known for its differentiated technology and its massive industrial installed base of equipment sprawled throughout the world. That installed base most notably includes aerospace engines, gas and steam turbines, and onshore and offshore wind turbines. GE earns most of its profits on the service revenue of that equipment, which is generally higher-margin. The company is led by former Danaher alumnus Larry Culp, who is leading a multiyear turnaround of the storied conglomerate based on lean principles.Story continuesGeneral Electric Co (GE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialProfitability BreakdownGeneral Electric Co's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. General Electric Co's Operating Margin has declined over the past five years ((-49.53%)), as shown by the following data: 2018: 6.97; 2019: 5.71; 2020: 0.54; 2021: 4.96; 2022: 3.52. Additionally, General Electric Co's Gross Margin has also declined over the past five years, as evidenced by the data: 2018: 28.46; 2019: 28.12; 2020: 23.69; 2021: 27.36; 2022: 27.46. This trend underscores the company's struggles to convert its revenue into profits.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where General Electric Co seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -5.5 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 83.28% of 2667 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, General Electric Co predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.General Electric Co (GE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While General Electric Co has a rich history and a significant presence in the Industrial Products industry, its declining profitability and growth ranks signal potential headwinds. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
332,dca2c0f3-c255-32cf-ab3a-41648d9bc59e,PGR,2023-08-30,Climate Calamities: Why These 3 Insurance Stocks Are Risky Bets Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/climate-calamities-why-3-insurance-163507125.html,1692808507,STORY,"['ALL', 'PRU', 'PGR']","[Including insurance stocks in an investment portfolio can be advantageous. The insurance industry offers enduring potential returns in various economic climates. Thus, for those worried about some potential stormy skies ahead, this is a common landing place for many investors.However, various risks tied to climate change (increases in wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters) may be changing the calculus for this sector. A number of insurance companies are exiting weather-prone states such as California and Florida, creating the potential for insurance deserts. This, in turn, could significantly impact certain housing markets.With that, insurance rates will likely rise to meet these increased future costs. Yet, one must wonder if the insurance sector is growing too risky, given the risk of rising claims relative to premium revenue for top property insurance companies. Here are three I think investors should be cautious with right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAllstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comInsurance leader Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is often a top choice for investors looking at this broader sector. The company provides a range of insurance services, with a focus on home and auto insurance, in the U.S. and Canada. Allstate is one of the insurers that has decided to pull coverage from high-risk markets. Whether this means the company will simply concede profitable market share to competitors, or is dodging a bullet, remains to be seen. However, investors don’t seem to be very bullish on the company’s outlook, with ALL stock trading at just 5.8-times free cash flow. That’s considerably below the sector median of 7.7-times.The company is diversified and does have a better relative valuation than the other names on this list. However, I think Allstate is a stock that’s not worth the risk, and could be a value trap even at these enticing levels.Progressive Corp (PGR)A white car with the Progressive logo written across the doors in big blue lettersSource: ShutterstockStory continuesYou’re likely acquainted with Progressive (NYSE:PGR), the second-largest U.S. car insurer. Amid this year’s decline, it’s a viable rebound contender. As with peers, rising expenses have impacted the firm. Escalating repair costs, pricier tech parts, and labor challenges have pressured auto insurers, hampering underwriting profits.Progressive’s Q2 earnings report was disappointing, causing a 13% share drop. The company noted unfavorable reserve development due to auto products. Despite short-term challenges, PGR’s captive customers through mandatory auto insurance in most states is an advantage. The increasingly perilous road conditions, exacerbated by the pandemic, make insurance essential. Given potential Federal Reserve impact, Progressive remains a sensible choice.If the broader environment takes a turn for the worse, Progressive’s financials put the company in one of the worst positions of its peers, in my view.Prudential Financial (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) faces turbulence despite a decent Q1. Second-half performance concerns arise as Q1’s 12.5% decline in assets under management hints at future challenges.Prudential faces a significant risk due to its substantial CMBS portfolio, vulnerable to a commercial real estate market downturn. Predicted value drop could affect its financial stability, leading to a complex future of challenges and opportunities.In Q2, Prudential’s net income was $511 million, a significant rebound from a $1.01 billion loss last year. Group Insurance achieved record operating earnings. Prudential might not gain like other stocks, but its stable dividend yield surpasses 5%. With that in mind, I’d caution investors about PRU stock appearing as a dividend trap at these levels. It’s one I’m avoiding right now for this reason.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth. Investing in dividend stocks is not just about finding companies with a history of paying dividends. It is also important to consider whether those dividends are growing over time. Increasing dividends makes a stock more appealing to people who want to earn regular income from their investments. This combination of consistent payments and growing dividends is a winning strategy for successful dividend stock investing.Although the market has favored tech stocks this year, it appears to be a favorable time to consider investing in dividend stocks as the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated the possibility of increasing interest rates. Here are some comments from the Fed chief at the US central bank’s annual conference on August 25:“Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”High-interest rate periods have historically fared well for dividend stocks. In one of our articles, we referred to Global X data, which revealed that from January 1960 to December 2017, about half of the returns from high-dividend stocks originated from dividends paid during times of elevated interest rates. During this period, portfolios containing high-dividend stocks yielded an average annual return of 13.02%, surpassing the S&amp;P 500's return of 10%. The report also mentioned that in seven out of ten instances when interest rates were rising during this period, high-dividend stocks demonstrated superior performance compared to the broader market.Another important aspect of dividends becomes evident when considering the impact of compounding. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, this compounding effect was examined for the S&amp;P 500 across various timeframes. The data used were averages for each continuous period, based on monthly data spanning 50 years up to June 30, 2021. The results reveal that as the time horizon extends, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, showing a positive correlation between the two factors. For instance, when comparing the annualized difference between the price return and total return of the S&amp;P 500 over each 10-year span, the average difference amounts to almost 78%.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Contract wins from federal or state authorities expand geographic presence and fetch premiums to the industry participants. An aging population may sustain solid demand for health insurers’ Medicare plans. An active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy enables them to bolster capabilities. Technology advancements are meant to boost operational efficiencies. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.About the IndustryThe Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Influencing the HMO Industry's Fate Expanding Customer Base: Industry players distribute cost-effective health insurance plans across different U.S. communities and make efforts to upgrade such plan offerings from time to time. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. This, in turn, results in growing membership, and the resultant benefit emerges in the form of improved premiums, the most significant contributor to a health insurer’s top line. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to millions of elective procedures being deferred. UnitedHealth Group official's announcement of their expected resumption is a cause of concern for health insurers. An increase in elective surgeries implies elevated medical costs for health insurers, which they must bear by exhausting premiums. However, the solid financial position and diversified operations empower industry participants to counter such headwinds.Story continuesAn Aging U.S. Population: The Medicare plans, primarily intended for people aged 65 or above, are administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The demand for such plans is expected to remain solid in the days ahead, considering the rising aging population throughout the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the period between 2010 and 2020 registered the fastest population growth in the age group of 65 years and above since 1880-1890. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, around 16.9% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. The industry participants can capitalize on the diversified health needs of a medically vulnerable population through their vast array of Medicare plans or even opening senior-focused centers for delivering quality care services.Pursuit of M&amp;A Strategy: Players in the HMO industry resort to an M&amp;A strategy that aims to enhance capabilities, expand their global presence and widen their customer base. The primary aim behind these deals is to enhance the quality of care and bring diversification benefits, enabling it to attain a competitive edge over industry peers. However, interest rate hikes by the Fed to tame inflation suggest higher borrowing costs, creating a headwind for the industry participants to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals.Technological Advancements: Health insurers pursue significant technology investments to stay up-to-date with the ongoing trend to go digital, showing no mood for slowing down. One such investment relates to devising virtual healthcare solutions, more commonly referred to as telehealth services that individuals can opt for within the comfort of their homes. These services render seamless delivery of healthcare services and are cost-effective. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, the telehealth services continue to fetch a steady revenue stream, boost operational efficiencies and drive margins in the long term.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director, Andrew Witty, sold US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$487 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$491. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 6.6% of Andrew Witty's holding.UnitedHealth Group insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).UnitedHealth Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. In total, CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director Andrew Witty dumped US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes UnitedHealth Group Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that UnitedHealth Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$1.5b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?An insider sold UnitedHealth Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since UnitedHealth Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing UnitedHealth Group.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth. Investing in dividend stocks is not just about finding companies with a history of paying dividends. It is also important to consider whether those dividends are growing over time. Increasing dividends makes a stock more appealing to people who want to earn regular income from their investments. This combination of consistent payments and growing dividends is a winning strategy for successful dividend stock investing.Although the market has favored tech stocks this year, it appears to be a favorable time to consider investing in dividend stocks as the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated the possibility of increasing interest rates. Here are some comments from the Fed chief at the US central bank’s annual conference on August 25:“Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”High-interest rate periods have historically fared well for dividend stocks. In one of our articles, we referred to Global X data, which revealed that from January 1960 to December 2017, about half of the returns from high-dividend stocks originated from dividends paid during times of elevated interest rates. During this period, portfolios containing high-dividend stocks yielded an average annual return of 13.02%, surpassing the S&amp;P 500's return of 10%. The report also mentioned that in seven out of ten instances when interest rates were rising during this period, high-dividend stocks demonstrated superior performance compared to the broader market.Another important aspect of dividends becomes evident when considering the impact of compounding. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, this compounding effect was examined for the S&amp;P 500 across various timeframes. The data used were averages for each continuous period, based on monthly data spanning 50 years up to June 30, 2021. The results reveal that as the time horizon extends, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, showing a positive correlation between the two factors. For instance, when comparing the annualized difference between the price return and total return of the S&amp;P 500 over each 10-year span, the average difference amounts to almost 78%.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

National Mortgage News Editor-in-Chief Heidi Patalano joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss housing market constrictions driven by rates and supply conditions.""We saw that new home sales hit a high last week, but yet home builder sentiment is down slightly because of... the interest rates scaring off some buyers,"" Patalano says on the challenges home builders like Toll Brothers (TOL) are facing. ""So we're seeing some of them offer incentives to get people into those homes, they're offering breaks in the customization of the homes that they're going to deliver and in closing costs.""Patalano also comments on regional pricing trends that are a deciding factor on whether to buy a home or build one.Video Transcript- Well, let's take a look at the housing market. It isn't showing many signs of cooling, even as mortgage rates hit a 22-year high. The Case-Shiller Index showed housing prices continued to rise in June, the national composite up almost 1% month over month, and seeing no change compared to last year. Now prices have held strong thanks to low existing home inventory that's been a boon for home builders.Looking at home builder stocks, they're all up over 20% year to date. Luxury builder Toll Brothers said in its latest report that the average price per home in its backlog is $1.75 million. Now that's up from $1.43 million last year. Joining us now is Heidi Patalano, National Mortgage News editor in chief. Good to see you here, Heidi. We still have this very tight housing market here. Good news for home builders though. But when do some of these home buyers get a break?HEIDI PATALANO: Right. That's a very good question. It seems like there is really no relief in sight for home buyers looking for some price breaks. Definitely, there's a inventory crunch right now, and that is keeping prices high despite the fact that mortgage rates are still inching up.Story continuesWe saw last week that mortgage rates hit 7.23%, the 30-year fixed average, which is just a high not seen in 22 years. And with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaling last week that he's open to continuing to raise the federal funds rate, we can expect that rates will stay up that high. But as I'm saying otherwise, those home owners who would otherwise list now are not incentivized to do so because the rates are so high, which keeps supply so tight and prices up.- So I was doing a little TI-84 calculator here just before the show, looking at one of the recent reports that came out from a new home builder and Toll Brothers last week just looking at the year over year increase that they're seeing in the backlog of homes that they're still delivering right now, and it came out to about 3.5%.A lot of buyers might look at that and say, OK, well that is kind of pairing with year over year inflation as of right now. But where is it different for some of the home builders and the new home market when it comes to the delivery and that timeline for delivery, especially given that this is one of the more expensive home builders out there? And what does that spell out about the broader housing market too if you have a company in Toll Brothers saying that, all right, we still need time to be able to deliver on all of these homes, and we've got significant backlog. And then at the same time, we need to write down where there is inventory that is unsold as well.HEIDI PATALANO: Yeah. Well, it's an interesting question because we saw that new home sales hit a high last week. But yet, homebuilder sentiment is down slightly because the rates because of the interest rates scaring off some buyers. So we're seeing some of them offer incentives to get people into those homes. They're offering breaks in the customization of the homes that they're going to deliver and in closing costs. So it's an interesting situation because there is that high demand. There may be a backlog that they're still catching up to. But there are certainly buyers for those homes out there.- So Heidi, as we look regionally then and people are trying to decide, is it better to get an existing home or try and wait for one of these new builds, considering sometimes, the costs can add on as you go in with a new build. How should people be looking at how to decide whether to buy a new build versus some of the limited existing home inventory?HEIDI PATALANO: Well, I think it really depends on which market you're in. One thing we're seeing about the home price trends is that they're really varying quite a bit from market to market regionally. So we saw prices go up in certain parts of the country in the northeast for example. But yet in markets like Seattle and San Francisco, we saw prices go down. And also, that new home inventory isn't coming up evenly across the market. So I think it really depends on where you're at.The other thing that's an interesting part of this is that rental prices for single family homes have sort of slowed in terms of their growth. And so right now, that is seeming like an attractive option in terms of staying in a rental and waiting it out for interest rates to come down.]"
348,93cb8dda-b8c7-3b12-9ee2-54960c7a386f,DHI,2023-08-30,7 Stocks Warren Buffett is Buying Hand Over Fist,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-buying-203859537.html,1692823139,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'COF', 'OXY', 'BRK-B', 'LEN-B']","[Warren Buffett has a knack for finding great companies selling at bargain levels. He’s consistently picked winners for years by targeting quality stocks when they hit a rough patch. Even with the recent market turbulence, Buffett can still dig up deals in 2023. Though he plays some moves close to the chest, looking at Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) latest high-conviction buys gives insight into where the investing legend is putting his money to work.Of course, that doesn’t mean that he isn’t into momentum plays. He’s been scooping up homebuilder stocks lately, and they have been on a tear. Unfortunately, Berkshire’s portfolio includes a lag of around two months or more, so Warren Buffett is already sitting on some hefty gains on the homebuilder stocks. Common sense says a plateau could be near for such stocks.Again, by the time you read this, many of these Warren Buffett stocks have gone up considerably, and Berkshire may have changed positions on some of them. While Buffett is a great investor, I recommend you form your own conclusions based on their current valuations. I am simply stating the facts here, so don’t shoot the messenger!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWhile oil prices have pulled back over the last few months, I believe crude could be nearing a bottom here, with some speculators betting oil may surge back up to $90 per barrel again soon. However, this short-term oil price fluctuation isn’t the only rationale behind Warren Buffett’s purchase of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Buffett has been notably bullish on OXY stock for quite some time now. Much of that appears to be due to the fact that Occidental boasts substantial operations in several oil-rich locations that offer massive growth opportunities ahead.Admittedly, investing in oil companies is controversial, as the rise of clean energy has led many investors to avoid the traditional energy sector entirely. That said, I think OXY stock still offers compelling value here, especially considering its recent underperformance versus other oil majors. On its latest earnings call, Occidental’s management team emphasized that the company possesses a diverse, high-quality asset portfolio that continues to churn out record free cash flows quarter after quarter. Its unique mix of unconventional and conventional resources provides resilience across commodity cycles. Occidental is also making great strides in low-carbon ventures that can create additional shareholder value over the long term.Story continuesSo while the future of oil certainly faces some uncertainty, Buffett likely sees significant upside potential still in OXY stock. The company is delivering operationally and financially, plus it offers exposure to future oil price upside if crude markets tighten global inventories. He increased his positions here by 5% to $13.2 billion, his biggest buy last quarter.DR Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHomebuilder stocks like DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) have exploded higher over the past year, so it’s no surprise that Warren Buffett has moved to scoop up names like this. Conditions have recently become quite favorable for leading homebuilders, with low existing home inventory levels combined with the normalization of previous pandemic-related supply chain challenges. That powerful combination helps explain why DR Horton and its peers have shined in 2023, despite ongoing concerns about a potential broader economic slowdown.DR Horton reported very strong Q3 results, including a 37% jump in net orders compared to the same quarter last year. While margins retreated moderately from the unprecedented peaks achieved last year, they are gradually recovering now as both home prices and the level of buyer incentives have stabilized considerably. The company also specifically noted that construction cycle times are decreasing as the availability of materials and labor continues to improve incrementally. With the extremely limited housing supply still constraining the overall market, there could be further momentum ahead for DR Horton’s business. Thanks to its diverse product mix and leading market share position, DR Horton remains well-positioned to continue gaining more market share in this significant housing supply-demand imbalance. Berkshire Hathaway added $726.4 million of DHI stock to its stash.Capital One (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comWhile major financial stocks overall stumbled along with the broader market in 2022, Capital One’s (NYSE:COF) tempting valuation after its pullback likely drew Warren Buffett in to build a position. In particular, Capital One’s generous capital return program, including both a solid dividend and very aggressive share buybacks, makes the stock tough for value investors like Buffett to ignore. In the second quarter of 2023 alone, COF has already repurchased $150 million of its own shares.However, Capital One is not immune to the increased economic uncertainty, as evidenced by its Q2 earnings results showing moderately higher loan losses. Credit card charge-offs are gradually normalizing from the unusually low levels witnessed during the pandemic period. Yet, per management’s commentary on the latest quarterly earnings call, aggregate credit quality remains quite solid for Capital One, for now at least, particularly in its most recent vintages of newly originated loans and credit card accounts. While it’s unclear exactly how long the current economic slowdown may last, Capital One is prudently leaning into growth opportunities in several key areas, like continuing to expand its digital bank and further growing its core credit card business. Though some nagging near-term headwinds do persist, Capital One’s ongoing investment in modern technology capabilities could ultimately drive greater efficiency and enduring shareholder value creation over the longer term. Berkshire Hathaway boosted its holdings in COF stock by 25% to $1.34 billion.Lennar (LEN)Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockWith homebuilder stocks surging over the past year amid favorable housing market conditions, it’s certainly no shock that Warren Buffett has moved to snatch up shares of homebuilding names like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) lately. LEN stock vaulted over 40% higher over the past year, as the entire homebuilder group has shone brightly during that period. Though Buffett didn’t take as substantial a position in Lennar as some of the other homebuilder buys, it remains a compelling pure play on the ongoing major housing shortage in America.According to its latest quarterly earnings release, Lennar saw Q2 revenue of $8 billion, which beat estimates by almost $800 million. While gross margins slid moderately from the unprecedented peaks achieved in the previous year, margins are gradually recovering now as Lennar has proactively cut costs and strategically stabilized home prices. Lennar’s management team expressed confidence on their earrings call that they can continue driving consistent financial performance and operational excellence from the business going forward. They remain laser-focused on maintaining healthy sales volume and pace while simultaneously maximizing returns and operational efficiency across the board. With the ongoing major housing supply deficits likely continuing to support strong fundamental demand for the foreseeable future, perhaps Buffett sees potential for significant additional upside still ahead for this best-in-class homebuilder. He added $17.24 million of the stock to his holdings.NVR (NVR)Person holding smartphone with logo of US distribution company Univar Solutions Inc. (UNVR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comRounding out Warren Buffett’s series of investments in homebuilder stocks recently is NVR (NYSE:NVR), which has also generated stellar returns for shareholders over the past year.In its latest Q2 earnings release, NVR reported a 27% year-over-year increase in net new orders, showcasing the strength of current demand trends. While overall Q2 revenues dropped 12.5% annually, net income only fell by 7% annually as NVR’s profit margins generally held up quite well. Looking ahead, NVR continues directing its focus on key strategic initiatives like turning inventory faster, continuing to pay down debt, and repurchasing its own shares to further boost shareholder returns.Admittedly, some lingering headwinds do persist for the housing sector, including still-high mortgage rates and intense inflationary pressures. However, strong fundamental demand combined with historically limited supply should allow efficient homebuilders like NVR to keep consolidating market share and generating impressive earnings in this constructive environment. While a potential recession could pose some risks, the company’s rock-solid balance sheet provides plenty of financial flexibility looking ahead.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIf you have already seen Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio additions, you may wonder where this came from since Berkshire Hathaway only reported five major buys in the recent report. It turns out the Oracle of Omaha has a ‘mystery’ portfolio worth $6.8 billion tucked away in a separate company, New England Asset Management. This allows him to build sizable positions in companies under the radar.Starting with Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), this was a surprising purchase, given its lackluster performance over the past few years. But upon closer inspection, I believe Buffett sees a compelling turnaround opportunity. Despite recent headwinds like supply chain challenges, KHC reported Q2 earnings that beat expectations.Management emphasized their cost-savings initiatives are paying off, enabling them to ramp up critical brand investments in marketing and innovation. They expect improving volume trends in the back half as pricing moderates and new product launches gain traction. I’m encouraged by KHC’s renewed focus on revitalizing core brands through R&amp;D. With the stock trading at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 11.5-times, this looks like a classic Buffett value play.CMS Energy (CMS)Image of a person holding a lit lightbulbSource: ShutterstockCMS Energy (NYSE:CMS) is a steady dividend payer that Warren Buffett likely sees as undervalued at current levels. The stock has drifted lower in recent months on macro concerns, but CMS offers stability with its focus on regulated utility operations.The company’s Q2 results were acceptable, with adjusted earnings per share beating estimates. Management reaffirmed full-year earnings per share guidance toward the higher end of the range, signaling confidence in their financial plan. CMS also continues to progress on its clean energy transition, retiring legacy coal plants while adding renewable generation.With CMS shares yielding 3% and trading at 18-times forward earnings, the current valuation leaves room for upside.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

349,f9b3949a-0b5f-3722-918c-fd68b70f7e63,AAL,2023-08-30,17 Highest Paying Countries for Pilots,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-highest-paying-countries-pilots-112324413.html,1693394604,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL', 'AAL']","[In this article, we will look at the 17 highest paying countries for pilots. We will also cover interesting aviation trends and discuss the highest paying airlines for pilots. If you want to skip our analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Pilots.The adage that ""the sky's the limit"" resonates strongly with the profession of pilots. Their training, experience, and commitment to safety justify the high salaries they command. With the responsibility of steering aircraft worth millions and the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, under their care, the demand for pilots is on the rise. This also explains why pilots are one of the most trusted professions in America. Moreover, cargo pilots have one of the highest paid positions in the aviation industry. The highest paid cargo pilots i.e the 90th percentile of these professionals can earn up to $137,096 on average. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the occupational outlook for airline and commercial pilots projects a 6% growth rate from 2021 to 2031, which is on par with the average growth across all occupations. By 2031, an estimated 18,100 openings for airline and commercial pilots are anticipated annually. The Boom of the Aviation IndustryThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently upgraded its outlook for the airline industry's profitability in 2023 and reflected a robust recovery from the challenges posed by the pandemic. Anticipated net profits for the airline industry have been revised to $9.8 billion, which is more than double the previous forecast of $4.7 billion. The improved financial picture is underpinned by several factors like the quicker-than-expected lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in China, resilient cargo revenues, and moderating jet fuel prices.Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) stands as a noteworthy example of this upward trajectory. The airline's remarkable operational performance during the busy summer season has translated into impressive financial figures. In the June Quarter of 2023, Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) achieved a record operating revenue of $15.6 billion and a record operating income of $2.5 billion with a strong operating margin of 16.0%. Earnings per share soared to $2.84 and thus, affirmed the airline's profitability. Notably, Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL) also managed its debt and finance lease obligations effectively, with a total of $20.2 billion at quarter-end. Delta Air Lines, Inc (NYSE:DAL)’s contributions to its employees were also evident as it has  allocated $667 million for next year's profit-sharing payment which is surely a testament to the airline's dedication to its workforce.Story continuesSimilarly, United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) also reported remarkable numbers in the second quarter of 2023 and hence, also reflected a robust recovery in travel demand. United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL)’s adjusted earnings per share came in at $5.03 which surpassed the expected $4.03, while its total revenue reached $14.18 billion and bet the anticipated $13.91 billion. Despite disruptions at its Newark hub, United Airlines Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) achieved a remarkable 17% increase in total revenue compared to the same period last year, with net income soaring to $1.08 billion during the same quarter last year.Aviation Trends to Watch Out for in 2023The global trend towards single-pilot commercial aircraft has recently gained traction in over 40 countries including Germany and the UK and has urged aviation standards bodies to enable such flights. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency collaborated with manufacturers to explore the feasibility of solo flight operations. While this proposed change aims to reduce expenses and alleviate challenges stemming from crew shortages, the prospect of entrusting the entire control of an aircraft to a single individual raises fears among certain stakeholders due to the increased  responsibility involved.While there are various industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is also revolutionizing the aviation industry across multiple fronts. After over a century since autopilot's invention, aerospace engineers are leveraging AI to enhance safety, efficiency, and pilot workload reduction. Autopilot systems have evolved into fully autonomous flight control, and the adoption of AI technology is evident at major industry events. EASA's AI Roadmap 2.0 emphasizes human-centric integration and safety, while machine learning research aids AI system approval.AI's impact extends beyond the skies which further optimize ground operations. AI assists aircraft assembly, maintenance, and overhaul, while fleet optimization, flight planning, and ground operations benefit from AI deployment. Generative AI like ChatGPT holds promise that facilitates vertical integration with proprietary data for bespoke applications. Digital twins benefit from AI-generated images and models, expediting their creation and reducing costs.Despite concerns about job displacement, AI is expected to create roles maintaining AI systems, developing algorithms, and ensuring ethical use. Human expertise remains crucial due to AI's inability to replace human perception.

The news comes as many Americans are looking for ways to stretch their dollars without breaking their travel budgets while travel seems to finally be back after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Spirit Airlines settles over carry-on feesIn Spirit’s case, the airline agreed on Aug. 23 to pay up to $8.25 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by passengers who booked flights on Spirit through online travel agents (OTAs) and said they were charged additional carry-on bag fees.According to federal court documents, the passengers booked tickets from Aug. 31, 2011 through May 3, 2017 on one of six OTAs – Expedia, Travelocity, Kiwi, CheapOair, Cheap Tickets and BookIt.The proposed settlement provides a cash refund of up to 75% of the carry-on fee paid to each class action member who submits a valid claim form. The amount paid will be pro-rated based on the amount of carry-on fee each person actually paid, per the court documents.Potential members of the class action suit will be sent notices advising them to review details of the settlement and submit a claim form. These members will be contacted via the email addresses that Spirit or the OTA have on file or, if an email address is unavailable and a mailing address is, by a postcard with instructions via first-class mail.Spirit did not immediately respond to requests for comment.American Airlines fined total of $4.1MAmerican, meanwhile, was slapped with a $4.1 million fine for illegally making 5,821 passengers wait on tarmacs for hours at a time without an opportunity to deplane, the Department of Transportation (DOT) said in an Aug. 28 statement.Of the total fine, $2.05 million will be credited to American for compensation provided to passengers on the affected flights, DOT said.Story continuesAmerican allowed 43 domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for long periods between 2018 and 2021 without allowing passengers an opportunity to deplane, the DOT it found in an extensive investigation. On one of those flights, passengers were not given food or water as required, the agency said. Most of the delays occurred at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.American said in a statement that the delays in question resulted from exceptional weather events and represent 0.001% of the 7.7 million flights the airline and its partners conducted from 2018 to 2021.“American always strives to deliver a positive travel experience to our customers and takes very seriously our responsibility to comply with all Department of Transportation requirements,” American said. “We have since apologized to the impacted customers and regret any inconvenience caused.”DOT said the fine is the largest ever assessed for violating federal statutes that prohibit tarmac delays of three hours or more on domestic flights without allowing passengers to deplane.“This is the latest action in our continued drive to enforce the rights of airline passengers,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “Whether the issue is extreme tarmac delays or problems getting refunds, DOT will continue to protect consumers and hold airlines accountable.”Your rights over flight delays and cancellationsButtigieg and the DOT have been looking into changes to help airline passengers in the wake of flight disruptions. Earlier this year, Buttigieg and President Joe Biden announced the formulation of new rules requiring U.S. airlines to compensate passengers and cover expenses such as meals, hotels and rebooking in cases where the airline has caused a cancellation or significant delay.You can use the DOT's airline customer service dashboard for more detailed information on what airlines entitle you to over delays and cancellations.Related Content24 Best Travel Websites to Find Deals and Save You MoneyThe Best Places to Visit Where the Dollar Is Strong5 Bargain Vacation Destinations Off the Beaten Path]"
351,acae9ea0-24b1-312e-a90f-53a1261cbfc8,ORLY,2023-08-30,Holiday discounts will look more like they did pre-pandemic: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/holiday-discounts-look-more-did-162518270.html,1693326318,VIDEO,"['BBY', 'ULTA', 'COST', 'ORLY', 'WMT', 'LOW', 'BJ']","[Best Buy (BBY) reported second quarter results that topped analyst estimates. D.A. Davidson Senior Research Analyst Michael Baker says that right now, there is a ""more promotional environment"" caused by retailers' desire to get people into the stores. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Baker tells Yahoo Finance Live that ""this holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic,"" with traditional door-buster sales. Overall, Baker says the best positioned retailers are Walmart (WMT), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Costco (COST), who all benefit from the increase in consumers looking for deals. Baker's other top picks include Ulta Beauty (ULTA), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), and Lowe's (LOW).Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: In some of the categories where consumers are continuing to show that they're either looking for a big discount, or waiting for a major sale or promotion to take place, what can you extrapolate from these numbers and apply towards, say, the Labor Day sales, or even further out some of the holiday shopping season sales. Are we going to see major doorbusters, and those deals that consumers have come to expect on a cyclical basis, because there's inventory that needs to be moved through, or just because Best Buy is going to have to do something to entice the customers back into the store here for some of the larger ticket items?MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah sure, a lot there. So it is a more promotional environment, absolutely. We are seeing it more promotional, we expect that over the holiday season. It's more because of the second thing you said, it's just to spur demand and get people to come on in and shop.It's less about inventory. Inventory is actually pretty clean right now, not just for Best Buy, but for a lot of retailers. That was a major issue last year. Most retailers, not all, there's still some pockets of heavy inventory. But most retailers have their inventory well under control. But it is more promotional just to get the consumer to come back in.Story continuesAs relates to Best Buy, the good news is, a lot of it is vendor-funded right now, because the vendors have the same incentive that Best Buy has, and that's to get people back in the store. So it is more promotional than last year. This holiday season is going to look a little bit more like it did pre-pandemic, which is those traditional doorbusters, and those types of things, those types of call to calls to action.Best Buy did say something interesting on the call today, and that is that some of their back-to-school categories are actually doing better than expected, typically that bodes well for the holiday season. Back-to-school points in the right direction for holiday sales in 85% of the time.BRAD SMITH: And so does that mean that we are to believe, and is expected now that the worst in the tech demand, and that lull is behind US?MICHAEL BAKER: Does feel like that. So we're still down year-over-year. But remember, we were down 10% in the first quarter, and then towards the end of last year. This quarter down 6%, and Best Buy is trending at down 5% in August.Still not out of the woods yet, but getting a little bit better. And Best Buy does think it's possible that holiday sales could be closer to flat. So we are trending in the right direction.There are some interesting green shoots that we heard about, in talking to the company. Laptop units were actually flat year-over-year, that's a good sign. TV units are actually up year-over-year. Gaming was a strong category. So there are definitely some positive signs that we're seeing.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Michael, as we're seeing consumers continue to trade down or trade off, which of the retailers do you think are best positioned, going into the holiday season, and beyond, keeping in mind that we are in an interest rate higher for longer environment.MICHAEL BAKER: Yeah, well bigger picture, we think among the best positioned retailers this holiday season, is Walmart, for sure. They span the spectrum of categories. But when the consumer is trading down, we are seeing some of that. We think Walmart is particularly well positioned in this environment.We think the clubs as well are well-positioned. A name like BJ's has added a lot to their general merchandise offering, and we think that could help their holiday seasons. Costco always does well in that kind of trade down environment as well.BRAD SMITH: And so from an investor perspective here, when you think about some of the top names in retail that investors should be paying close attention to, even amid what Corie Barry, the Best Buy CEO, continues to call a very unfamiliar, or all too familiar macroeconomic environment with several challenges, who would some of those top picks be?MICHAEL BAKER: Well, it's all about expectations and what's already embedded in the stock price. And sometimes the best sales performance doesn't necessarily mean the best stock. But that being said, best ideas, again, Walmart, we think, is particularly well positioned here. We like ALTA on the pullback that we've seen. We think that represents good value for a name-taking market share.Another name that we highlighted as a best idea earlier in the year, and has done particularly well, we haven't really talked about in this conversation, O'Reilly Auto Parts, that space is doing very well. And then the last one we'll throw out is Lowe's, Lowe's has been a particularly good stock this year. For them it's all about closing the margin gap with Home Depot, and through new management over the last couple of years, they've been able to do that.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It certainly makes sense as people try and do more at home with their cars, and with their homes, as well, that those are some of the companies that would also be doing well. A big thank you there to Michael Baker, D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst. Thank you for your time this morning.]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study Universal Health Services'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Universal Health Services How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Universal Health Services is:11% = US$679m ÷ US$6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Universal Health Services' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, Universal Health Services seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Universal Health Services saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesWe then compared Universal Health Services' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 11% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Universal Health Services fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Universal Health Services Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Universal Health Services has a low three-year median payout ratio of 6.9% (or a retention ratio of 93%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.Additionally, Universal Health Services has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 6.2%. As a result, Universal Health Services' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 13% for future ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Universal Health Services certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

(FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-freeport-mcmoran-130006424.html,1693314006,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -12.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 8.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.39 per share, indicating a change of +50% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34%. This estimate has changed +5.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.16 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The $23.13 billion and $24.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +4.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $2.18 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.66%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $23.42 billion, up 6.59% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.48 per share and revenue of $92.18 billion. These totals would mark changes of +10.16% and +6.7%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth. Investing in dividend stocks is not just about finding companies with a history of paying dividends. It is also important to consider whether those dividends are growing over time. Increasing dividends makes a stock more appealing to people who want to earn regular income from their investments. This combination of consistent payments and growing dividends is a winning strategy for successful dividend stock investing.Although the market has favored tech stocks this year, it appears to be a favorable time to consider investing in dividend stocks as the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated the possibility of increasing interest rates. Here are some comments from the Fed chief at the US central bank’s annual conference on August 25:“Although inflation has moved down from its peak — a welcome development — it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”High-interest rate periods have historically fared well for dividend stocks. In one of our articles, we referred to Global X data, which revealed that from January 1960 to December 2017, about half of the returns from high-dividend stocks originated from dividends paid during times of elevated interest rates. During this period, portfolios containing high-dividend stocks yielded an average annual return of 13.02%, surpassing the S&amp;P 500's return of 10%. The report also mentioned that in seven out of ten instances when interest rates were rising during this period, high-dividend stocks demonstrated superior performance compared to the broader market.Another important aspect of dividends becomes evident when considering the impact of compounding. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, this compounding effect was examined for the S&amp;P 500 across various timeframes. The data used were averages for each continuous period, based on monthly data spanning 50 years up to June 30, 2021. The results reveal that as the time horizon extends, the compounding effect becomes more pronounced, showing a positive correlation between the two factors. For instance, when comparing the annualized difference between the price return and total return of the S&amp;P 500 over each 10-year span, the average difference amounts to almost 78%.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, DraftKings Inc. DKNG, Marriott International Inc. MAR and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Ignores Powell's Rate Hike Warning: 5 PicksOn Aug 25, at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium of the Fed, Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the inflation rate is still highly elevated despite steady progress in the past year. Consequently, the central bank is open for more hikes in the near future.According to Powell, ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.""Justifying the fact for the Fed fund rate to move higher, Powell said, ""The economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up.""Surprisingly, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — advanced 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, after Powell's warning of more rate hikes. The small-cap benchmark, the Russell 2000, also gained 0.4%.After Powell's comments, market participants are directionless regarding the future trajectory of interest rate movement. The CME FedWatch is currently showing that the there exists an 80% probability that the Fed will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, while a 20% chance of rate hike by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting.Story continuesHowever, for the November FOMC meeting, a 44.5% probability is assigned for maintaining the status quo and a 55.5% probability is assigned for a rate hike of 25 basis points or more.Whatever the situation, market participants have cheered the Fed Chairman's acknowledgment that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain rock solid despite suffering from a double-edged sword — a 40-year high inflation rate and a more than 22-year high interest rate.The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. On Aug 24, the Atlanta Fed estimated the GDP growth rate to climb 5.9% in the third quarter. These data eliminate the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.The major catalyst of U.S. economy is personal consumption expenditure (consumer spending), which accounts for nearly 70% of the GDP. Therefore, at this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in consumer-centric stocks to enrich one's portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) consumer-centric stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

On Aug 25, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium, delivered a balanced speech.While he showed confidence in the economy, he also maintained his hawkish stance and said that inflation is still elevated and more interest rate hikes are required.Powell added that economic growth has been stronger than expected as consumer spending has been robust. However, more interest rate hikes are required to pull down inflation to the Fed’s target level of 2%.“The economy may not be cooling as expected.

369,bce295ad-4fe0-33d0-bdff-36330f214018,CSCO,2023-08-30,Climate Finance Tracker: Mapping the Climate Finance Ecosystem,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/climate-finance-tracker-mapping-climate-123000865.html,1693312200,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 29, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.This blog was prepared with deep thanks to Cisco employee volunteer Haitham Al-Shabibi.Climate change is an issue we can't solve alone, yet it seems like very few of those working to solve it have a big picture view of who is already working on what or where their work fits into the broader solutions landscape. Without a collaborative approach, effectiveness of private philanthropic and impact investment capital is severely limited. Climate funders need transparency, effective tools, and a holistic view of the landscape in order to make better decisions to set high-impact priorities.The Climate Finance Tracker (CFT) is a suite of visual interfaces engineered by Vibrant Data Labs (VDL), an organization housed in Berkeley, California, that combines data and network theory into flexible tools, to tackle systemic social challenges like climate change. The CFT visualizes climate funding flows to organizations and companies on the ground. What started as a simple United States finance tracker is now poised to scale into Europe, Africa, and Latin America.In 2021, VDL became a recipient of a grant via Cisco Foundation's Climate Impact &amp; Regeneration commitment to build out an initial prototype of the CFT. Since launching the CFT fall of 2022 in partnership with One Earth &amp; Impact Alpha, they have been overwhelmed by the positive response. It has led to active collaborations with Climate Policy Initiative, ClimateWorks Foundation, Elemental Excelerator, Forbes, Global Commons Alliance, Summit Impact, and TED.The partnership between Vibrant Data Labs and Cisco Foundation is built on the shared belief that by building capacity, improving transparency, and supporting funders and decision makers, efforts addressing the climate crisis can be much more effective.We recently caught up with Eric Berlow, founder of Vibrant Data Labs and co-creator of the CFT, who was awarded an Emerson Collective Climate Fellowship. He shared more about his background, philosophy, and goals.Can you tell us a bit more about your background?Eric: Yes, so I have a PhD in marine ecology and in particular I work to understand nature as a complex system. You can't do that kind of work in nature without being able to deal with noisy data and statistics, so as a result I had to develop a strong background in data science and network theory.I worked in Yosemite National Park for five years for the University of California running a research institute, trying to bridge science, policy, and natural resource management for evidence-based decision making. We had a big, collaborative project synthesizing satellite and on-the-ground data to predict where threatened amphibian species were breeding. The data helped prioritize where limited park resources should be allocated to protect the species.How does your background in ecology help inform the CFT?Eric: Well, that is exactly how the CFT works - we use data to see the big picture and to help prioritize where funding efforts should go, given that resources are limited.Another way to think about it is: If you map out who eats who in an ecosystem, you have complex flows of energy that comprise an entire food web. Turns out, those network structures are not random. They're really critical for how those systems persist, and why they don't crash. Instead of analyzing who eats whom, we're using the same statistics to analyze who funds whom. Now, we have a funding ecosystem.My passion over the past decade has been thinking about how ecological theory can inform solutions to complex problems, like climate. It requires a big picture of understanding multiple causality. There is no one silver bullet, there's no one moon shot.If you could sum up what the CFT is trying to solve, what would it be?Eric: The public CFT is a visual Rolodex. It's about overcoming myopia, which I think is the root cause of so many of those complex problems. But the main goal is to promote discovery and foster collaboration so people can see who's doing what, avoid duplication, and fill in gaps where funding is missing.We are also hoping to help people see that the success of an investment is dependent on other investments, too. Let's say you have great investments with electric vehicles (EVs), but not with chargers or grid upgrades, that investment could fail. It will be critical to fill those gaps.At the end of the day, we want to make it easy for someone to poke around and paint a picture of where money is flowing in different climate spaces.You mentioned ""silver bullets"" and ""funding gaps,"" can you explain this a bit further?Eric: Imagine you are in a community that is trying to grow a tree. You know it needs sun, water, nitrogen and phosphorous to grow. If any one of these is missing, it dies. If everybody just gives it water, it dies. Everyone needs to know what that tree is getting, and what is missing. The most important thing to contribute is always whatever is missing.Here in the US, we have a ""silver bullet"" mentality, where one thing will solve it. This idea of, &amp;lsquo;Just give the tree water, and it lives', which isn't the case. Let's take the renewable energy and mobility transition. You could have great investments in renewable power generation like solar and electric vehicles. But if you don't have upgrades in distribution through our aging grid, it doesn't matter. If you don't have your charging infrastructure, it won't work, and those other investments fail.It wasn't until pulling together data on who is funding what and where that I realized what a huge opportunity for impact is this issue of filling gaps. If one thing is missing, we fail. If we want to have an impact, we need to find where funding is lacking. And the only way to find those gaps is to see where the money is flowing.To identify those gaps, you'd have to have tags and categories in the first place, correct? How does that work?Eric: We currently start with philanthropy and investment data from Candid and Crunchbase (with more on the way!). We then gather, from online sources, more data on how the grantees and investees describe their work. This allows us then - using various methods, including natural language processing and machine learning - to categorize the organizations and let them self-organize into themes - all based around who is working on similar things.A key challenge has been to develop a method for searching for &amp;lsquo;climate relevant' investments and grants. To do that we start with broad topic searches - for things like &amp;lsquo;climate' and &amp;lsquo;agriculture,' but then we need to filter these results because not all agricultural solutions are climate-positive, or some may mention &amp;lsquo;climate' but in the wrong context. To do that we manually review a random subset of the results and use that to &amp;lsquo;fine-tune' a Large Language Model to identify in the remaining results which are actually relevant to climate - for example, companies that are addressing things like regeneration, soil health, and sustainable water usage.Can you give an example of a helpful action that can be done with CFT data?Eric: Yes! Let's stick with food systems and agriculture. If you're new to the space, the CFT allows you to see who is funding regenerative agriculture. More so, you can use those tags to see who, and what, is being funded. This is how we improve transparency and increase efficiency. If you're looking for funding - or if you are a funder who is new to a topic - you can quickly see who you should be talking to!We can also go deeper to see where organizations mention language related to social equity and justice. For example, who states an intent to address energy poverty in low-income and rural communities. We can see financial flows into community-based conservation, restoration of land and community resiliency, equitable resourcing for the clean energy transition, and the intersection of climate solutions with general livelihood improvement.We can help optimize funding and investments so resources can better flow to high-quality organizations, initiatives, or companies that are traditionally overlooked or underserved by the existing financial system.Really it just comes down to the fact that engaging communities in the solution is actually the solution. It's not just a moral thing to do, to improve the livelihoods of vulnerable communities, but it's how you can truly scale and build out markets. For example, if you support energy independence for everyone, it creates more demand for electric mobility, which creates more demand for charging infrastructure, and so on.What parting thoughts would you say to people who are interested in the CFT?Eric: Part of our goal with the CFT was to show that climate solutions are not just solar panels and electric cars, those are just tiny corners of the landscape. If we can move beyond that silver bullet mentality, we can see that there are so many ways to contribute: you don't need to become an electrical engineer.We want to change the conversation, bring a positive tone that brings everyone along. There are so many things we can do to help more people. Of course, we'll have to make sacrifices, but how cool is it that we get to build a whole new world? We get to make a renewable and regenerative transition. And we have to do it together.It doesn't matter how well-funded one company is, it will never solve every climate problem.It doesn't matter how rich one donor is, they will never solve it alone.It doesn't matter how big an investment fund is, it never will work alone.We need to empower everyone to be part of the solution.With thanks to Eric Berlow and Vibrant Data Labs for sharing their story with us, we invite you to learn more about the Climate Finance Tracker here!View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, August 29, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/778036/climate-finance-tracker-mapping-the-climate-finance-ecosystem]"
370,e117ddca-f757-3bc7-baae-5b1f196cf798,CSCO,2023-08-30,Possible Bearish Signals With Cisco Systems Insiders Disposing Stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-cisco-systems-120022762.html,1693310422,STORY,['CSCO'],"[In the last year, many Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO, Maria Martinez, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$998k worth of shares at a price of US$49.88 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$56.20). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 12% of Maria Martinez's holding.Cisco Systems insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Cisco Systems Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Cisco Systems. Specifically, Independent Director Roderick McGeary ditched US$510k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Cisco Systems insiders own about US$84m worth of shares. That equates to 0.04% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Do The Cisco Systems Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Cisco Systems stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Cisco Systems is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration.
