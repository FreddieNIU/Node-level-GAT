However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDE has amassed assets over $4.71 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Co. Index (Net) before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index (Net) ranks companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index by measures of fundamental size and tracks the performance of those companies whose fundamental scores are in the top 87.5% of the Russell Emerging Markets Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.39%.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 5.33%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, China Construction Bank Corp H accounts for about 3.62% of total assets, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd.Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 23.94% of FNDE's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, FNDE has gained about 5%, and is down about -6.24% in the last one year (as of 04/06/2023). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $23.19 and $29.14.The ETF has a beta of 0.75 and standard deviation of 18.62% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 374 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $69.50 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $71.55 billion. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VWO charges 0.08%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And now, with the new tools available at our disposal, we can include artificial intelligence in that quest to find superior investments.To that end, we asked Bing, which is Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) deployment of OpenAI’s revolutionary ChatGPT program, what it thought might be disruptive tech stocks worth keeping an eye on. Bing came up with two answers that make a lot of sense, along with one pick that was totally out of left field.As always, investors should do their own due diligence on stock picks, regardless of whether they come from a human or artificial intelligence. That said, let’s see what disruptive tech stocks Bing finds intriguing for 2023 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMSFTMicrosoft$286.61TXNTexas Instruments$183.82TZUPThumbzup Media$8.50Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comFirst up for Bing’s preferred tech disruptors is Microsoft. I must point out some potential bias here, as Microsoft owns Bing. It’s a convenient choice, to be sure.However, I can hardly fault the AI for the pick. Microsoft has built a tremendous platform in recent years. In addition to its investments in artificial intelligence, the tech giant has a leading position in cloud computing, its Hololens virtual reality system and its quantum computing ecosystem among other disruptive technologies.It’s unclear the precise path that the AI revolution will end up taking. But it’s a good bet to think that Microsoft will play a leading role in the next decade of technological progress, regardless of the shape of that evolution.Also, MSFT stock is down roughly 5% over the past year. That’s even as earnings continue to rise, making the starting valuation more reasonable. Microsoft isn’t cheap by any means at 30 times forward earnings, but it’s not a bad entry point for this cutting-edge tech titan either.Texas Instruments (TXN)a computer chipSource: ShutterstockStory continuesTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is America’s largest producer of analog semiconductor chips.Analog semiconductors are a unique part of the chip marketplace. They serve to turn real-world observations such as climatological information into data that machines can use. This ability to digitally translate the real-world is vital for applications such as remote monitoring, self-driving vehicles, automated manufacturing and many other applications.Because analog semiconductors go into a lot of industrial applications, they are less cyclical than other chip sectors such as memory. This has allowed Texas Instruments to enjoy strong and stable earnings and free cash flow growth over the decades while avoiding the sorts of deep slumps that firms like Micron (NASDAQ:MU) find themselves in today.What makes Texas Instruments a particularly disruptive technology investment? In a sense, it sells the picks and shovels for the tech industry. To automate, electrify, and digitize many industries, we’ll need billions of the little analog chips that Texas Instruments makes. As an example, no matter what company ends up with the best electric vehicles, you can be sure that Texas Instruments will sell many of the chips going into that electric car or truck.Thumzup Media (TZUP)Woman hand holding smartphone against blur bokeh of shop background VDO ads concept, April brings video marketing, social media, and real estate togetherSource: 4 Girls 1 Boy / Shutterstock.comThe AI’s last disruptive pick is more off the beaten path. It chose Thumzup Media (OTCMKTS:TZUP) which is a digital marketing company. Thumzup operates a social media tool that mixes marketing with social media.It has a group of advertisers, such as restaurants and retail chains, that will pay Thumzup for attention. Meanwhile, any user of the app can post pictures and video ads about select Thumzup clients to social networks such as Instagram and earn a commission if it results in traffic and sales for the firm that requests advertising.Founder and CEO Robert Steele says that he aims for Thumzup to be the “Uber (NYSE:UBER) of advertising.” If the company gets anywhere close to that, it could result in a highly favorable outcome for investors.To date, Thumzup hasn’t achieved much commercial success, with revenues last quarter being just a few thousand dollars. I must admit to some skepticism of Bing’s pick here, but the idea has potential. If Thumzup can develop more traction, the marketing firm could be worth revisiting later in 2023 and beyond.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

Nucor (NUE), which belongs to the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This steel company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.88%.For the most recent quarter, Nucor was expected to post earnings of $4.18 per share, but it reported $4.89 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.99%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.45 per share, while it actually produced $6.50 per share, a surprise of 0.78%.For Nucor, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

According to a new survey by Unum Group, more employees are financially fragile than employers may realize.The recent survey found:46% of U.S. workers have less than $1,000 in their checking/savings account at any given time.Almost half (48%) of U.S. workers would only be able to maintain their finances for two months if they couldn't work due to an injury, accident, or serious medical condition – up 8% from 2020 and most prominent among Millennial and Gen Z.In a time of high inflation, many employees around the globe are struggling to keep themselves and their families financially secure.Employees expect employers to helpUnum's research found 39% of U.S. workers don't feel their employer offers a robust benefits package.Unum business in the UK also found the effects of financial pressures on employees have negatively impacted productivity for nearly 30% of the workforce.In these uncertain times, there is a desire for more than a steady paycheck — employees need and expect help with their financial security and wellness.""It's important to take a fresh look at employee benefit offerings to make sure employees feel supported, especially related to voluntary benefits that promote greater financial stability,"" said Liz Ahmed, executive vice president of People and Communications at Unum Group.Ahmed also added that offering voluntary benefits can provide competitive advantage to companies to set them apart from their peers. Voluntary benefits can make a differenceVoluntary benefits, such as accident, hospital, and critical illness insurance, can protect employees with minimal savings and help pay for out-of-pocket expenses. These benefits can also help employers offer more quantity and choice, while still tailoring employee benefits to fit the age, lifestyle, income, and other circumstances of their employees.Story continuesDiverse supplemental insurance options can ensure employees and their families have access to additional financial peace of mind.Methodology: Unum Group, survey of 1,000 full-time U.S. workers, November 2022.About Unum GroupUnum Group (NYSE: UNM), an international provider of workplace benefits and services, has been helping workers and their families for 175 years.

It was frustrating for the bankers and frustrating for the clients, especially the ones who didn't feel as comfortable with technology,"" Rodriguez said. ""With cobrowse, now it's so easy.""It's so easy, in fact, that Rodriguez recently was able to cobrowse with a customer who had been visiting the Pineville branch several times a week to conduct routine transactions like depositing a check or keeping tabs on her account balance. The customer said she typically avoided interacting with technology - hence all the visits to the branches - but within just a few minutes Rodriguez had showed her how to do a mobile check deposit, lock her ATM card and look up her balance. The customer now just drops by the branch to say hello to Rodriguez, but hasn't needed help with a single banking transaction since - she does them all herself digitally.""It's empowering for our customers. She was so grateful - and so proud of herself that she can now do all of this on her own,"" Rodriguez said. ""She told me she now has all of this time back since she doesn't have to get to the branch when it's open.""A human + digital approachU.S. Bank ramped up cobrowse during the early days of the pandemic and social distancing guidelines. But the company quickly realized the feature had staying power and would have long-term value to customers even after lockdowns were lifted, because it's so convenient and helps customers conduct their transaction or get guidance from local bankers no matter where they are. In fact, usage only accelerated after branches reopened. More than one in four U.S. Bank customers have now used cobrowse, and millions have used it multiple times.Story continuesBecause they love it. In customer satisfaction survey results, customers report 97% satisfaction with the feature - a level of satisfaction that is almost unheard of in any industry. It truly has become a key part of how we serve customers in the way that works best for them, and a strong indicator of the effectiveness of our human + digital approach to provide the best experiences in banking.""The pandemic certainly accelerated clients' adoption of digital tools, and they enjoy being able to DIY their banking when and where it fits their needs,"" said Tim Welsh, vice chair, U.S. Bank Consumer and Business Banking. ""But they still want to have that human connection - especially when it comes to more complex needs like making big decisions and setting goals. So, we've invested in many ways to do things together, including new video banking experiences that put us at the intersection of digital and people.""Making ‘the best experiences in banking' even betterThose new video banking experiences include adding cobrowse with video in 2021, allowing branch bankers to appear on one-way video so customers can see who is helping them - enhancing the interaction and making it feel more personal. U.S. Bank was the first in the industry to introduce live video of the banker, and customers have said that being able to see who they are talking to on video is reassuring and gives a greater sense of security.We continue to add new features to the experience, like two-way video - meaning a customer can choose to appear on video as well, if they so wish. This puts the decision in the customer's hands, giving them the option of having whichever level of visual interaction with the banker they feel will help them most. We also integrated Live Chat with cobrowse, so bankers can invite customers to a cobrowse session while chatting on both Mobile App and Online Banking.And cobrowse is even helpful during in-person visits to the branch. Like the example shared by Wade Glover, a branch manager at the Kearny Mesa location in San Diego. One day, a mother and daughter came into the branch distraught because they weren't certain of the best way to send money to the daughter when she moved away to college. With a quick cobrowse, Glover showed them how to download the mobile app, enroll in Zelle, add each other as recipients - and test it out right there.""They were so pleased to know we had Zelle and mobile banking right there in the app - no additional downloads needed,"" he said.It's all about helping customers bank in the way that works best for them.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747960/Cobrowse-Marks-Three-Year-Milestone-With-Millions-of-Fans]"

Increased volumes and higher prices are driving revenues at the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment (revenues rose 11.5% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023).Strength across the first aid cabinet service business is boosting Cintas’ First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance.

""Consider electronics stores like Best Buy, or warehouse stores like Costco (which is also known for its electronics warranty). And here's a tip for Black Friday: Walmart will always have some of (if not the) lowest doorbuster prices on select TVs - but make sure you check the brand and the specs - it might be worth paying a couple hundred dollars more at Walmart or at another retailer to get a TV that lasts longer, instead of that tempting doorbuster.""Punrit Thongma-eng / Shutterstock.comBatteries""Batteries may be less expensive at Amazon.com or a warehouse store, such as Costco,"" said Laura Adams, MBA, a personal finance expert with Finder.com.Story continuesnastya_ph / Getty Images/iStockphotoMeat""If you've seen the TikTok videos talking about WalMart's potential issues with poultry freshness, and you are looking for a place where the meat selection is fresh and delicious, I highly recommend ALDI,"" said  Chloe Elise, a certified financial coach and the CEO/founder of Deeper Than Money.

""The best deal you can find on this item is undoubtedly at a warehouse club: Costco has a 33.8 ounce bottle for $13.11 which works out to about 39 cents per ounce; at Walmart, even the generic brand (which is usually the cheapest) will cost you nearly 64 cents per ounce, although a 32 ounce bottle (the closest to the Costco size) will cost about 50 cents per ounce.""Materio / Getty Images/iStockphotoHoney""Similar to maple syrup, the cost of this sweetener is much more at Walmart than if you buy in bulk,"" Ramhold said. ""A 12-ounce bottle of Great Value honey is about $3.72 or 31 cents per ounce; however, at Costco, you can buy 5 pounds of wildflower honey for $15.29 - that's 19 cents per ounce. If you use the sweetener often (or even if you don't) you can't beat that price.""DustyPixel / Getty Images/iStockphotoGeneric Paper Plates""At Walmart, you can get generic paper plates for as little as 3 cents each, but the odds are good that you'll be trading quality for that,"" Ramhold said.

In fact, Amazon alone brought in around $149.2 billion (net) in the fourth quarter of 2022.

In some cases, you might even end up paying less if you shop in person rather than online.“Big box stores are perfect for people wanting to purchase their groceries in bulk for a much healthier price than branded supermarkets,” said Natalie Warb, financial expert at CouponBirds. “These stores offer a much-reduced rate for items that can be found in everyday grocery stores, but at certain times of the year, even further reductions can be taken advantage of.”Take Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Shopping at Big-Box Stores Throughout the YearMany big-box retailers will bring in new merchandise for specific holidays or events. These stores also frequently have discounts throughout the year. Here are some of the best times of the year to go shopping (and what to buy):Story continuesJanuary: Federal holidays like New Year’s Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day are great times to scout out sales at places like Walmart, Target and Big Lots. You could get discounts on things like winter apparel and other out-of-season items. If you’re big into the winter holidays, this is also a good time to stock up on next year’s decor.February: Long weekends throughout the year — including President’s Day — often come with deals on things like appliances or mattresses.March: Many big-box stores offer deals on outdoor clothes, furniture and accessories around the start of spring.April/May: You can often find clothing and households appliances marked down around Easter. Certain big-box retailers — including Walmart and Target — will have deals on things like jewelry, spring attire and major appliances around Mother’s Day and Memorial Day.June/July: Big-box stores will often have Independence Day or Father’s Day discounts. Depending on where and when you shop, you could find marked-down prices on popular items like televisions, grills, menswear and tools. Big Lots, for example, often reduces their prices on furniture around this time of year.August/September: With summer coming to an end, big-box retailers tend to drop their prices on things like summer apparel, patio furniture and other outdoor supplies. You may also start seeing seasonal discounts on school items around this time.October/November/December: Some of the biggest sales of the year happen during these months. Big-box retailers like Costco, Walmart and Sam’s Club typically have Black Friday deals on everything from electronics to games to appliances. Some of these deals will extend a couple of weeks before and after the actual day.Other Times To Shop at Big-Box StoresLooking for some other ways to get some discounts at big-box stores? Here are some of the best times to go if you’re looking for the best deals.Special Savings WeekCertain big-box stores have special savings periods.“In Sam’s Club, customers are advised to keep a look out for the brand’s ‘special savings weeks’ that run at different times in the year,” said Warb. “In 2021, their spring event lasted from April 10 to April 18 and currently there is an instant savings event running until April 10 which began in March.”End of the SeasonCertain things — like coats, sandals and swimwear — regularly get swapped out for items that are more appropriate for the season. Unless you’re in a rush for new clothes, wait until the season’s about to change before going shopping. You’re more likely to find some major deals this way.This goes for back-to-school apparel and other goods, too. Things like binders, backpacks and kids’ clothes tend to be marked down in October once the rush has ended.Before New Merchandise Comes InTarget, Walmart and other big-box stores don’t have a strict restocking schedule. However, they typically restock their shelves between one and three times a week — often on Mondays, Thursdays or just before the weekend.These retailers also often mark down the items they plan to switch out in order to clear the shelves. This can lead to greater discounts than you’d get otherwise.Try shopping early in the morning, too, especially if you’re getting perishables like meat.“You’re going to find the cheapest prices while shopping in the morning before the next daily shipment hits the stores and the older meat needs to be sold or tossed,” said Lexy Rogers, author of “Break Bread on a Budget.” “Ask the store manager when they receive their shipments and shop around the few days/hours before.”As an added bonus, if you go shopping on a weekday you could get to some of these sales without the competition of other shoppers.Two Months Into the SeasonIt may be tempting to shop as soon as the new season’s items come in, but try to hold off for a month or two. Many big-box retailers will reduce their prices on goods that have been sitting on the shelves for a few weeks. You might end up missing out on some of the more popular items, but you could also reduce impulse buying and save money.More Ways To Save Money at Big-Box StoresKnowing the best times to go shopping is one thing, but shopping at big-box retailers could still be costly if you’re not careful. Having the right shopping strategies can bring your savings to a whole new level. Here are some of the best ways to save money at big-box retailers:Get a price match. If you purchase something in person but find a lower price online, ask for a price match. You may be able to get it at the lower price point.Get a price adjustment. If you buy something and the price changes afterwards, ask for a price adjustment. If you have proof of purchase, you could get a refund on the difference between what you originally paid and the new price. Costco, for example, offers price adjustments for most goods that change prices within 30 days. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club offer price adjustments for prices that change within seven days of purchase.Buy meat early and in bulk. “When it comes to shopping at big-box stores, meat in any variety can put a dent in your wallet,” said Rogers. “I recommend buying in bulk, shopping on a weekday early in the morning and freezing what you don’t need right away.”Return items you don’t need. Most big-box retailers have some kind of return policy. Costco, Walmart and Target, for example, will let you return unopened, nonperishable items for up to 90 days after purchase. Sam’s Club has no time limit on returns, but you will need a receipt.Use coupons. Many big-box stores have coupons for additional discounts on goods. Some retailers, like Sam’s Club and Costco, have retailer-specific coupons. Others, including Walmart and Target, accept manufacturer coupons.

We've got Walmart, Levi's, and Comcast.Kicking off with Walmart, now the retailer adding thousands of EV charging stations to its stores, expanding its current footprint of 1,300 EV stations at 280 stores. Now Walmart didn't give many details about the suppliers who they are going to work with when installing these EV charging stations. But right now, they have currently worked with EVgo and also Electrify America in the past.Big picture, though, this could maybe help EV adoption. We know there certainly is some range anxiety. And there's a Walmart store or Sam's Club within 10 miles of about 90% of Americans. So more access there, potentially, to some of these charging stations. EV sales accounted for just 7% of all US vehicle registrations in January.So Josh, the lack of charging stations is just one of the challenges here, just in terms of main widespread adoption of EVs. So Walmart being one of the first, or one of the biggest, I should say, retailers making this push into installing some of these charging stations.JOSH SCHAFER: Probably a trend that we're going to see, right, because I think specifically with Walmart and Sam's Club, it just makes a lot of sense. Because one thing I know I've personally thought about when it comes to charging is I don't want to sit there while it charges, right. And people will hopefully have them, as Dave fumbles here, and maybe we'll charge, we'll charge up later with the hot sauce.But I think it's interesting to think about how you're going to charge these. And obviously, Walmart or Sam's Club lines up well, because that's a store you go into for say maybe 30, 40 minutes, you're doing a long grocery run and a lot of shopping in there. So it gives you time to kind of properly charge up.Story continuesI'll let Dave-- or Dave, do you a comment on the charging stations?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, I will. I was at the New York Auto Show yesterday. And I will tell you, every single automaker I spoke with, every single writer and blogger said that the biggest single factor in mass adoption for EVs is the lack of charging stations.And the important thing about Walmart is not just how many they are, but where they are. They're in rural America, where there's no chargers. Essentially, all the chargers in this country are Los Angeles, San Francisco, and some in New York City and Austin, Texas, where Elon Musk has taken Tesla. But really, the entire middle section of this country is void of chargers. So this is a huge development for the industry, even more so than it is for Walmart probably.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly.JOSH SCHAFER: Probably be a battle for those chargers, though, right, when there's only a couple.DAVE BRIGGS: No question.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it depends how many there are at each store. Got to be lucky with the timing.DAVE BRIGGS: But again, to your point, we're still only at 7% in terms of EV adoption.]"

The company sees EV charging as a profitable business on its own and a way to bring customers into stores, he said.Over the years, Walmart tried to tap its giant parking lots to draw customers in other ways, including allowing recreational vehicles to park overnight.Price Action: WMT shares traded higher by 0.47% at $150.38 on the last check Thursday.Photo via Wikimedia CommonsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This regional bank holding company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.75%.For the last reported quarter, Huntington Bancshares came out with earnings of $0.43 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.41 per share, representing a surprise of 4.88%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.39 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.63%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Huntington Bancshares. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Huntington Bancshares currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.96%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Companies from various industries and sectors file for Chapter 11  protection. The focus on bankrupt retailers just boils down to most of us understanding and frequenting stores.I googled “potential bankruptcies,” and the first five results involved retailers. Naturally Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) was featured prominently in all five stories. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut since BBBY is widely expected to declare bankruptcy, I won’t include it on my list of three potential bankruptcies that could shock the market in 2023.  Instead, I will search the  S&amp;P Composite 1500 for businesses whose Altman Z-Scores are near or below 0, the level at which investors should become worried about a company’s financial strength.  The Altman Z-Score is designed to assess the financial strength of businesses and the likelihood of them going bankrupt over the next 24 months.WBDWarner Bros. Discovery$14.81COTYCoty$12.12NCLHNorwegian Cruise$13.35Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.Source: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.comWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav’s compensation is almost as astronomical as the debt load of his entertainment company. In 2022, Zaslav received $39.2 million of total compensation. Warner Bros. Discovery had $49.9 billion of total debt at the end of December, equal to 1.4 times its market capitalization. Nonetheless, most analysts are bullish on WBD stock. On March 17, Wells Fargo and Wolfe Research  upgraded the shares.Wells Fargo analyst Stephen Cahall upgraded WBD to “overweight” from “equal weight,” and raised his target price on WBD stock to $20 from $7. Wolfe Research’s Peter Supino upgraded the shares to “outperform “from “peer perform” with a $20 price target. “Why the upgrade now? ‘Almost a year post-merger, guidance and the stock are lower, while internal visibility is higher,’ Supino explained, echoing others’ recent commentary that the company had put the worst behind it and was turning a corner. ‘We expect execution, free cash flow generation and debt-to-equity value transfer to improve from here,’” The Hollywood Reporter noted.  Story continuesBoth analysts are convinced that the owner of media brands such as HBO, HGTV, Warner Bros., CNN, the Food Network, and many others will significantly reduce its debt over the next few years.WBD had better cut its debt for two reasons: Its current Altman Z-Score is 0.35, making it a prime candidate to go bankrupt over the next 24 months. Secondly, it would be embarrassing for the board to pay Zaslav such an obscene amount of money only to have him run the company into the ground.   Coty (COTY)Compared to where Coty’s (NYSE:COTY) share price was a year ago, the struggling cosmetics company’s stock is doing much better, as it has gained 34% during that time. In June 2022, I included Coty in a list of seven cheap stocks under $20 that could double soon. I argued that the firm’s hiring of former L’Oreal executive Sue Nabi to transform its business was a brilliant move. But, of course, it didn’t hurt that Coty generated free cash flow. In mid-March, Coty reported that its like-for-like (LFL) sales for would be up 10% or more in its fiscal Q3 versus a year earlier and that its Q3 LTL sales three percentage points higher than in the previous quarter. Additionally, it expects its 2023 LFL sales growth to be at the high end of its previous guidance of 6%-8%. So the company’s business is getting stronger.However, when I wrote about Coty last June, it had reported trailing 12-month free cash flow of $628 million. As of December, that metric had dropped to  $447 million, causing its valuation to climb to 23 times its free cash flow. Further, the firm’s Altman Z-Score is 0.61, putting it in the distress zone, according to Altman’s original system.  So bankruptcy is still a possibility for Coty.  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH)Norwegian Cruise Line ship arriving at a port. NCLH stock.Source: Ian_Stewart / ShutterstockI’m of two minds regarding Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH). On the one hand, nobody handles debt better than the cruise lines. But NCLH is the smallest of the three leading operators -(Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) are the others), likely making Norwegian’s chances of bankruptcy higher than the other two. However, a good friend of mine just returned from a Norwegian cruise in the Southern Caribbean, and he and his girlfriend had a blast. Their cruise started in Puerto Rico, went down to Aruba, and back up through some of the smaller Caribbean islands. They stayed in Haven, the cruise line’s luxury accommodation separate from the rest of the ship. They had no complaints. People love cruising. On a number of occasions since the pandemic began, I argued that many consumers would resume taking cruises again, and they generally have. In February Norwegian reported that it total revenue per passenger cruise day increased by 24% in Q4, excluding currency, compared to Q4 of 2019.    The problem is that its total debt at the end of December was $13.6 billion, 2.4 times its market cap. As a result, its Altman Z-Score is  -0.56, the lowest of the three stocks featured in this article. So if 2023 doesn’t continue to deliver for NCLH,, bankruptcy is a very realistic outcome for it.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

From there, they operate heavy machinery that digs out the coal and moves the precious resource above ground. It is hard work, the miners said, but essential to keep the country going.“Today, the country’s energy independence is more than a priority,” said Oleksandr, the chief engineer, who, like all the coal miners interviewed, spoke on the condition of giving only his first name for security reasons.Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s nuclear, thermal and other power stations continue to disrupt electricity service as the war grinds on for a second year.Negotiations to demilitarize the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which the Kremlin's forces captured last year at the start of the full-scale invasion, are at an impasse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opposes any proposal that would legitimize Russian control of the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear energy facility.At full capacity, the plant can produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity. The Ukrainian operators of the plant shut down the last reactor in September, saying it was too risky to run while Russia bombarded nearby areas.Shelling has damaged the plant numerous times, raising fears of a possible nuclear meltdown. Russian missiles have also threatened the power lines needed to operate vital cooling equipment at Zaporizhzhia and Ukraine's other nuclear plants.Before the war, the Ukrainian government planned to reduce the country's reliance on coal-fired power stations, which contribute to global warming, and to increase nuclear energy and natural gas production. But when Russian attacks damaged thermal plants in the middle of winter, it was coal that helped keep Ukrainian homes warm, Oleksandr said.Story continuesThe work of the coal miners cannot fully compensate for the loss of energy from nuclear power plants, but every megawatt they had a role in generating reduced gaps.“We come and work with optimism, trying not to think about what is going on outside the mine,” a miner named Serhii said. “We work with a smile and forget about it. And when we leave, then another life begins (for us), of survival and everything else.”While many miners from the area joined the armed forces when Russian troops invaded and are now fighting at the front in eastern Ukraine, nearly 150 displaced workers from other coal-producing regions in the east joined the team in Dnipropetrovsk.A man named Yurii left the embattled Donetsk province town of Vuhledar, where he worked as a coal miner for 20 years. “The war, of course, radically changed my life,” he said. “It is now impossible to live there and the mine where I used to work.”“Life begins from scratch,” he said.British military analysts reported Saturday that they think Russia’s campaign to degrade Ukraine’s energy grid over the winter through intense missile and drone strikes “highly likely failed,” and that the invaded country’s energy situation would improve as temperatures rise.The U.K. Defense Ministry said that while the strikes have continued since October, large-scale attacks causing significant infrastructure damage are becoming rare. Ukraine’s network operators also managed to source replacement transformers and other “critical” components to keep electricity flowing, the ministry said.___Samya Kallab contributed to this story from Kyiv, Ukraine.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine]"

OPEC nations pursued the cutbacks following a momentary drop in oil prices during March's banking turmoil and fears of a recession that could hurt energy demand.Bloomberg's data shows that Russia pumped around 1.285 million tons of crude oil a day, or over 9.4 million barrels. At the same time, exports of the commodity grew considerably, up 4.13 million barrels a day in the last week of March.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

All the six Gulf Arab states--Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman--are on track to post budget surpluses, many for the first time in a decade thanks to buoyant oil prices and years of fiscal reforms.But it’s not just the Arabian oil giants that will be enjoying the good times. In its latest forecast, the World Bank has predicted that in 2023, the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will grow 3.5%, more than twice the global average growth rate of 1.7% thanks mainly to high energy prices and increased oil production. GCC growth is expected to stabilize at 3.7% this year after expanding at a blistering 6.9% clip in 2022.Diversification and Sustainability Remain KeyAlthough hydrocarbons remain the backbone of MENA’s economy, the realities of climate change as well as wild oil price swings have been forcing Gulf nations to restrategize and diversify their economies away from oil--and Saudi Arabia is leading the way, again.Although Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman recently made waves in the oil community after telling Bloomberg News that Saudi Arabia intends to pump every last drop of oil and is going to be the last man standing, Saudi Arabia has crafted one of the most ambitious clean energy blueprints: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 economic plan.In the economic plan, Saudi Arabia has set a target to develop ~60 GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, which compares with an installed capacity of roughly 80 GW of power plants burning gas or oil.Story continuesSo far, Saudi Arabia has only made limited progress deploying renewables with just 520 MW of utility-scale solar in operation while 400 MW of wind power is under construction.With its sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes, Saudi Arabia is prime real estate for renewable energy generation. Last year, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco sent shockwaves through the natural gas markets after it announced that it was kicking off the biggest shale gas development outside of the United States. Saudi Aramco said it plans to spend $110 billion over the next couple of years to develop the Jafurah gas field, which is estimated to hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. The state-owned company hopes to start natural gas production from Jafurah in 2024 and reach 2.2 Bcf/d of sales gas by 2036 with an associated 425 million cubic feet per day of ethane.Two years ago, Aramco announced that instead of chilling all that gas and exporting it as LNG, it will convert it into a much cleaner fuel: Blue hydrogen.Saudi Aramco has  told investors that Aramco has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Nasser said that the kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR) with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet.Last year, Aramco made the world’s first blue ammonia shipment--from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan--a country whose mountainous terrain and extreme seismic activity render it unsuitable for the development of sustainable renewable energy--is looking for dependable suppliers of hydrogen fuel with Saudi Arabia and Australia on its shortlist.The Saudi government is also building a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce green hydrogen.But here’s the main kicker: Helios could soon produce green hydrogen that’s cheaper than oil.Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates that Helios’ costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land.Germany has said it needs “enormous” volumes of green hydrogen, and hopes Saudi Arabia will become a key supplier. Two years ago, Germany’s cabinet committed to invest €9B (about $10.2B) in hydrogen technology in a  bid to decarbonize the economy and cut CO2 emissions. The government has proposed to build an electrolysis capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 and another 5,000 MW by 2040 over the next decade to produce fuel hydrogen.The European economic powerhouse has realized it cannot do this alone, and will require low-cost suppliers like Saudi Arabia especially as it doubles down on its green energy commitments following a series of devastating floods in the country.UAE: Nuclear, Wind and Waste-to-EnergyBack in 2021, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) announced the commissioning of the country’s first-ever nuclear power plant--the Barakah unit 1.The 1,400-megawatt nuclear plant has become the single largest electricity generator in the UAE since reaching 100% power in early December, and is now providing ""constant, reliable and sustainable electricity around the clock.""ENEC says Barakah unit 1 is ""now leading the largest decarbonization effort of any industry in the UAE to date.""Following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia, the UAE is also laying a strong foundation for the energy transition.Masdar, the clean energy arm of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, is building renewable capacity in central Asia  after signing a deal in April 2021 to develop a solar project in Azerbaijan.Since its inception in 2006, Masdar has built a portfolio of renewable energy assets in 30 different countries, having invested about $20bn to develop 11GW of solar, wind and waste-to-energy power generation capacity.And now Masdar says it intends to apply the lessons gleaned abroad to develop clean energy capacity back at home. “Solutions we have developed in our international operations will definitely have applications here in the UAE”, says Masdar’s El-Ramahi.For instance, Masdar plans to bolster the UAE’s comparatively weak wind resources by developing domestic wind farms using the latest class three turbines that are able to harness electricity even from low wind speeds.Further, the company is also constructing a $1.1bn facility that will burn garbage to generate power in one of the world’s largest waste-to-energy plants. Once complete, the plants will incinerate almost two-thirds of the household  wastes the country generates every year.Though not typically considered a clean energy source, modern waste-to-energy plants are much cleaner as per the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). By using advanced technologies, these plants are able burn waste at extremely high temperatures thus ensuring complete combustion while missions are specially treated, leaving minimal amounts of toxic byproducts like flue ash. In fact, tests have shown that the air emitted by certain waste-to-energy chimneys can be cleaner than the air flowing in.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The UK Doing Enough To Achieve Its Ambitious Climate Pledges?Commercial Drones Poised To Disrupt Global Supply ChainsThe Middle East Is Investing Billions Into Desalination ProjectsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Results for the quarter that ended on March 31 are expected to be reported on April 28.Pioneer, the third-largest producer of oil after Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips in the top U.S. shale basin, denied a media report six weeks ago that it was considering an acquisition of smaller rival Range Resources Corp .It said at the time that it was ""not contemplating a significant business combination or other acquisition transaction.""(Reporting by Shivani Tanna and Jaiveer Shekhawat in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Sabrina Valle in Houston and Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Bill Berkrot)]"

Inflation in the U.S. and in Europe remains elevated despite all major central banks having raised their benchmark interest rates. The rotation to value stocks versus growth stocks could gain momentum as higher interest rates at some point will be the main theme not just for institutional investors but for individual investors as well, with the bond market anticipated to earn a lot of attention as the inverted yield curve in the U.S. financial market poses the risk of a recession. Lastly, oil prices may have dipped, but they remain high, and the unexpected shock of OPEC's decision in early April 2023 to cut its crude output sent oil prices above $81 per barrel to their highest price this year after dipping to nearly $66 per barrel, representing a rally of nearly 24%. Due to three key factors, I belive Shell PLC (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the most interesting ways to play continued high oil prices.SHEL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SHELPeter Lynch Chart of SHELOPEC's decision for oil output cuts is a catalyst for sustained revenue growthOn April 2, 2023, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced oil output cuts of around 1.16 million barrels per day, and on the following Monday when global financial markets opened, oil prices had gapped up to above $80 per barrel from about $75. Was this decision a surprise production cut that analysts did not expect? It can be argued that this was the case, and for sure this is bad news for inflation and for consumers. On the other hand, it is good news for Shell, as the company will have the opportunity to present higher revenue as long as oil prices remain high.The high oil prices have not yet been fully reflected in Shell's stock price in my view as the stock has gained only 6.36% year-to-date. This could be explained by the fact that the stock has a Beta of less than 1.0. In other words, the stock according to statistics should move less than the broader market. Indeed, this is true of most mega-cap stocks as the S&amp;P 500 has gained of 6.92% year-to-date.Story continuesThe question is whether high oil prices can be sustained at levels above $80 per barrel or even $70 per barrel during the remainder of 2023. History can't predict the future, but we can try to find a plausible justification based on the fundamental law in economics, which is the law of supply and demand.World oil demand is expected to remain strong during the rest of 2023On March 15, 2023, the International Energy Agency raised its estimate for global oil demand in 2023 by another 100,000 barrels per day as rebounding air traffic and pent-up Chinese demand push consumption to record highs. The gains are expected to accelerate over the year.The expected rebound in oil demand is due to at least two key factors: the rebound in air travel and the momentum picking up in the Chinese economy.Shell: 3 Bullish Factors to Consider for 2023 as Oil Prices Have RalliedSource: S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsIt seems that the Federal Reserve will have a tough time figuring out how to tame inflationary pressures as energy prices continue to rise following the OPEC cut, as energy prices have a knock-on effect on multiple areas of just about every supply chain.Strong sales growth and improved profitability over the past two yearsLooking at the financials, there are several things to like about Shell. The company reported revenue growth of 44.84% to $261.50 billion in 2021 and 45.82% to $381.31 billion in 2022. Gross profit and operating income increased by 55.02% and 123.22%, respectively, in 2022. Net profit in 2021 improved to $20.10 billion, up 192.72% year over year, and in 2022, Shell reported a net profit of $42.31 billion, showing growth of 110.48%.The balance sheet is strong as Shell had a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.44. A key metric to monitor is free cash flow. The company reported positive free cash flows for the whole period of 2017 to 2022. In 2021, the free cash flow was $26.10 billion, and in 2022, free cash flow grew to $45.81 billion, an increase of 75%.In terms of valuation, the stock has a price-earnings ratio of 5.10, a price-sales ratio of 0.57 and an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio of 0.66. These numbers imply that Shell may be undervalued.In addition to its strong growth and financials, Shell has a dividend yield of nearly 3.5%. Its Beta of less than 1.0 makes it a defensive stock in the energy sector, and it has not rallied to its full potential despite the recent OPEC oil output cut.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said that the bank “looks forward to establishing a futures company in China as we grow our domestic business footprint.”With this, Morgan Stanley will become the second foreign bank to wholly own a futures business in the world’s second-largest economy.The first foreign bank to fully own a futures company in China is JPMorgan JPM. In June 2020, JPM received approval to increase its stake in its futures joint venture (JV) — J.P.Morgan Futures Co. — from 49% to 100%.Notably, China is the second-largest equity market globally, and is one of the broadest and deepest growth markets outside the United States. Given that China’s financial market is open to foreign firms following the removal of ownership restrictions in 2018, several global banks have capitalized on the lucrative prospect.In August 2021, JPMorgan received regulatory approval to obtain full ownership of its China securities JV. The CSRC granted the Wall Street banking giant permission to own a 100% stake in J.P. Morgan Securities (China) Co.In November 2020, JPMorgan raised its stake in the securities venture to 71%, which came after the company completed the transaction to buy a 20% stake from one of the local partners — Shanghai Waigaoqiao FTZ — for 177.7 million yuan ($26 million).Like JPM, Credit Suisse Group AG CS also wanted to fully own its securities JV in China. In September 2022, Credit Suisse entered an agreement to buy out its local partner, Founder Securities’ 49% stake in Credit Suisse Founder Securities for 1.14 billion yuan ($163.92 million).Credit Suisse Founder Securities was formed in 2008 as a JV between Credit Suisse and Founder Securities. The JV provides various capital market services to clients in the domestic China market, which include sponsoring and underwriting shares, foreign investment shares, and government and corporate bonds, along with financial advisory services.In June 2020, CS raised its shareholding in the JV to 51% from 33.3% following the opening of the China markets.Notably, Morgan Stanley has a presence in China since 1994. With offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and a regional office in Hong Kong, the company offers a wide array of services to domestic and international clients, including financing, restructuring, M&amp;A advisory, research, fixed income and foreign exchange.Over the past six months, shares of Morgan Stanley have gained 6.2% against the industry’s decline of 6.4%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

According to analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers, A.I. could add up to $15.7 trillion in global GDP in 2030, which is more than the current output from India and China combined.But experts caution that investing in generative A.I. is far more nuanced than just buying Big Tech stocks that have integrated the technology. “This could be another one of those moments where we’re getting to the peak of the hype cycle, so companies are going to spend the money, but they’re going to find it’s a lot harder to build something truly compelling,” explained Peter Cohan, business professor at Babson College. “Microsoft has a big investment in OpenAI, and they also have GitHub, which has a lot of the software that can be used for developing A.I., yet I still don’t know if that’s going to generate enough revenue for Microsoft for A.I. itself to become a significant part of its business,” he noted.But it’s impossible to ignore that in an era of high inflation and subpar index returns, companies and funds that focus on A.I. and machine learning have strong growth potential. For example, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which tracks 44 holdings of companies involved with industrial robotics and automation, nonindustrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, is up 18% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 is just up 7%. For investors who want to get in on this burgeoning area, here are the smartest ways to approach investing in A.I.Story continuesBig TechA plethora of companies across sectors are integrating A.I. into their operations, from Land O’Lakes to Microsoft to cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. So you may already be indirectly investing in A.I. Big Tech is leading the charge from both investment and innovation standpoints. “A.I. is being defined actively by leading tech giants,” explained PitchBook tech analyst Brendan Burke, citing the leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). “Those companies have the research labs and the operational tools to bring basic innovations in A.I. algorithms to market,” he said.If you want to bet on Big Tech, Microsoft has forged ahead the furthest with its $10 billion investment in OpenAI and the subsequent rollout of revamped search service Bing with new A.I.-powered search features. While Bing’s features have debuted with some bizarre and disturbing interactions with users, if the technology does successfully upend Google’s search, Microsoft has a huge market share to gain. “We believe incorporating ChatGPT capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance,” wrote D.A. Davidson software analyst Gil Luria in a recent research note. Luria increased Microsoft’s price target from $270 to $325 and gave the firm a buy rating. “While Google has announced a project to add [generative] A.I. to Google Search, we believe Bing’s head start could create a permanent share shift,” Luria wrote. Yet with the speed bumps in the rollout of Bing, it is clear that generative A.I. chatbots still have a long way to go.Chart shows AI-focused fund performances y-t-dBank of America analysts, on the other hand, wrote in a recent report that Meta’s stock has the most to gain from A.I. implementation, citing the company’s incorporation of A.I. into its Reels video feature. “We expect an outsized impact from the adoption of A.I. given rich consumer data sets and massive ramp-up in A.I. investments, led by Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon,” the report detailed. Bank of America gave Alphabet and Amazon buy ratings in its forward-looking 2023 report.Comparing the A.I. boom to the dotcom boom of the early 2000s, it is clear that if you pick the right companies you can still make out very well. “Even if you bought Amazon at the height of the dotcom boom, you still would have made a lot of money,” said Tom Taulli, a startup advisor and A.I. author.But the giants have a problem—they’re huge. “It’s harder to move the needle for [Big Tech] as opposed to some of these smaller or midsize companies that are going to wind up playing in space that is going to be significant,” Helfstein said. “Maybe they won’t be as recognizable, but they have better growth potential, which can turn into investment returns,” explained Helfstein.The “picks and shovels” of the A.I. boomDuring the California gold rush, some of the savviest investors eschewed chasing gold itself and made a mint investing in the picks and shovels that those looking for riches needed for their search. Cohan sees an analogy in A.I. “It might well be that the initial beneficiaries of A.I. expansion are going to be in the hardware space, instead of the software space,” Helfstein predicted.So what “picks” do experts recommend? PitchBook’s Burke explained: “A.I. growth is based on the improved efficiency and the decreased cost of [graphics] processing units (GPUs). The most basic enabler for these new models is the latest hardware innovations coming from chip giants such as Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA).” Semiconductors are necessary for A.I. software to function, and the companies that produce them will supercharge its expansion.Nvidia is currently the leading chip producer in the A.I. space. “A lot of capital is going to go into these generative A.I. startups,” said Cohan. “And the question for investors is: What technology will they be using to build their APIs? The answer is that they’re very likely to be using Nvidia chips.” “It’s the early days in terms of picking winners and losers.”Scott Helfstein, head of thematic solutions at Global X ETFsBeyond chips, there is software infrastructure to support the huge volume of data that the A.I. explosion will rely on. “The next layer up, there’s a need for enterprises to integrate their data into centralized data warehouses to improve the performance of their A.I. models,” Burke explained. “That’s where database management vendors, such as Snowflake (SNOW) and Alteryx (AYX) can help enterprises,” he said. Zacks gives both companies buy ratings.Dynatrace (DT) is another cloud-computing infrastructure firm that could have upside. The company operates a software intelligence platform that uses A.I. and automation. Bank of America thinks the stock, which is up 1% year to date, has further to run, giving it a buy rating.Another winner could be Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which is projected to increase its market share and revenue as one of its biggest clients, the U.S. government, expands its military A.I. implementation. In October 2022, the company signed an $85 million contract with the U.S. Army Materiel Command to use its software to increase military A.I. capabilities. The company was founded in 2003 by a group of VCs including Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp. While the stock is up 31% year to date, analysts (like those at BofA who have a “buy” rating on the stock) expect it can further capitalize on the A.I. boom.A.I.-focused fundsThough A.I. technology has had a breakthrough year, there are already a robust number of funds and ETFs that give you exposure to the sector, which is a win for investors. “With these emerging technologies, people are better off playing a basket of companies, rather than putting their chips in a single one,” said Helfstein. He drew a comparison to Tesla in the electric vehicle industry. While Tesla was first out of the gate to dominate the EV market, competitors are now lining up to surpass the reigning EV king: “I don’t think we’re gonna live in a world that’s dominated by a single A.I.—it’s going to be a competitive market.” Not to mention the inherent unpredictability of an industry evolving at warp speed. “This can be a volatile space; you never know what could happen tomorrow, so diversification is important,” explained Taulli.A solid option is the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which is up 18% year to date and has $1.64 billion in assets under management. Its top holdings include Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical, Upstart Holdings (UPST), Keyence (KYCCF), and ABB (ABB).BlackRock’s iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO) is another option, which has 118 holdings and around $288 million in assets under management. Year to date, the fund is up 15%, solidly outpacing the S&amp;P 500.A widely diversified option is the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which holds 79 stocks with the top five holdings representing just 9% of the fund’s value. Year to date, the ETF is up 12%.The Defiance Machine Learning and Quantum Computing ETF (QTUM) has roughly $116 million in assets under management, and its top holdings include Nvidia and Alteryx. Year to date, its return is roughly 16%, and the fund received a five-star rating from Morningstar Research in December 2022.Overall, experts advise caution—and patience—when it comes to investing in generative A.I. “Investors should keep in mind that breakthroughs tend to be nonlinear,” explained Helfstein. Having just seen a period of what he calls “exponential innovation,” don’t be shocked if now we “level off for a little bit” before the next surge.A version of this article appears in the April/May 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “Buying the A.I. boom.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

60,52ddf9cb-ac98-3443-847e-f99f9e7f247b,WBA,2023-04-08,California to keep paying Walgreens despite abortion dispute,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-keep-paying-walgreens-despite-195711310.html,1680897431.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's Medicaid program will continue to pay Walgreens about $1.5 billion each year despite Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring last month the state was done doing business with the pharmacy giant after it indicated it would not sell abortion pills by mail in some states.“California won’t be doing business with @Walgreens -- or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk. We’re done,” Newsom tweeted March 6.He then ordered his administration not to renew a $54 million contract with the company to provide prescription medication to the state's prison system.But cutting ties with Walgreens wasn't as clear cut as the governor first indicated. Walgreens has a much more lucrative connection to California's Medicaid program — the joint federal and state health insurance program for people who are disabled or have low incomes. Federal law says Medicaid patients have the right to fill prescriptions from any willing and qualified provider.That includes Walgreens.Last year, California's Medicaid program paid the company more than $1.5 billion. The California Department of Health Care Services said California will continue to comply with that law, Kaiser Health News reported.“California has no intention of taking any action that would violate federal Medicaid requirements, or that could undermine access for low-income individuals,” said Tony Cava, spokesman for the California Department of Health Care Services.Anthony York, spokesman for the governor, also told Kaiser Health News that the Newsom administration had invited Walgreens to apply again for the $54 million contract the state chose not to renew last month.“Tweeting is not policy,” York told the news outlet.York said Friday the Walgreens contract was not renewed but that the company ""may seek future procurement opportunities.”This is not the first time Newsom has made a splashy announcement without first working out all of the details behind it. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Newsom administration quickly signed a contract to purchase masks and other personal protective equipment, frustrating some lawmakers who did not know the details.Story continues“This is something that politicians bump up against all the time,"" said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University who focuses on politics and elections. “They want to say something strong and big and bold and splashy, and the devil is in the legal details.”Newsom's spat with Walgreens began after the company indicated it would not distribute abortion pills by mail in some conservative states. That pill, mifepristone, when combined with another pill, will end a pregnancy. It's been approved since 2000 in the U.S. for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. Today, more than half of all abortions in the U.S. are done this way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.Several states have taken steps to restrict mifepristone, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion protections last year. Earlier this year, attorneys general in 20 states, mostly with Republican governors, warned Walgreens it could face legal consequences if it distributed mifepristone in their states. Walgreens responded by saying it would not distribute mifepristone in states where it is not legal to do so.On Friday, Walgreens spokesperson Fraser Engerman referred questions to Newsom's office. But Engerman reiterated the company's position about abortion pills.“Walgreens plans to dispense mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so,” Engerman said. “Once we are certified by the FDA, we will dispense this medication consistent with federal and state laws. Providing legally approved medications to patients is what pharmacies do, and is rooted in our commitment to the communities in which we operate.”Newsom's former chief of staff, Ann O'Leary, represented Walgreens in discussions with the Newsom administration over the issue last month, Politico reported.]"

This is significantly below from last year’s comparable quarter when Covid’s Omicron variant fueled the drugstore chain to earn $883 million, or $1.02 a share. Excluding certain items, per-share earnings were $1.16 which topped the estimate brought on by Refinitiv’s poll of analysts that amounted to $1.10.However, revenue rose 3% YoY and amounted to $34.86 billion, topping the expected $33.53 billion. Health care unit revenues topped $1.6, VillageMD’s primary care services grew 30% and CareCentrix’s home care rose 25%.Yet, operating income fell from more than $1.2 billion to nearly $200 million. What a difference a year makes due to a $306 million pre-tax charge for opioid litigation claims, increase in investments in pharmacy wages and as well as costs that resulted from the acquisition of a primary care provider.Growing The Healthcare UnitWith Rosalind Brewer at the helm for two years now, the emphasis is on expanding the health unit primary care and in-home services. The Summit Health acquisition alone costed $3.5 billion during the quarter but as a result, Walgreens is now one of the largest players among primary care providers.Intense Competition In HealthcareDespite its intense push into healthcare, Walgreens has no time to waste as earlier this year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) started expanding its presence in the healthcare sector. Amazon’s new subscription plan for generic drugs is a service named RxPass and it is certainly a threat to Walgreens' chain of pharmacies.CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) is also making moves to encourage customers to treat common health issues at their pharmacies as opposed to visiting a healthcare provider. It created the so-called HealthHubs which even offer care for chronic conditions. Even Walmart (NYSE: WMT) began offering healthcare services at its stores. Walgreens’ push into healthcare with its VillageMD acquisition should result in a launch of 1,000 clinics at its stores by 2027, but Amazon and low-cost retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) that have such a large presence, threaten their growth opportunities and their already-low margins. Amazon has certainly not been shy about its intentions to disrupt its healthcare and it already changed e-commerce for good.Story continuesA Covid-owed DropComparable sales in the front of store dropped by 1% due to weakened demand for over-the-counter Covid tests.U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $27.6 billion in revenues which translates to a drop of 0.3%. However, comparable pharmacy prescription sales rose 4.9% due to higher prices on brand name drugs.The international segment is a rare bright spotDespite currency headwinds, international sales rose more 1.5% YoY to $5.7 billion. Boots UK comparable retail sales jumped 16%, making an eighth consecutive quarter of market share gains.OutlookThe full year earnings guidance was reaffirmed to be in the range between $4.45 to $4.65 per share, with adjusted earnings growth project at mid-20% over the next two quarters.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sysco. View our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Sysco does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sysco, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sysco. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.3% and 6.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Sysco Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$67m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Sysco. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Sysco   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Xcel Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy Xcel Energy's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, Xcel Energy has grown EPS by 6.1% per year. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Xcel Energy maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$15b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Xcel Energy?Story continuesAre Xcel Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Xcel Energy, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. To be specific, they have US$35m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.09%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Xcel Energy, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.Xcel Energy's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.4m in the year leading up to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Xcel Energy Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Xcel Energy is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Xcel Energy, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for Xcel Energy (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

69,f74ee148-d942-3e61-85ba-bac8054aa558,ADM,2023-04-08,There's Been No Shortage Of Growth Recently For Archer-Daniels-Midland's (NYSE:ADM) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-no-shortage-growth-recently-140022682.html,1680789622,STORY,['ADM'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Archer-Daniels-Midland:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$60b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Food industry average of 10%. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceIn the above chart we have measured Archer-Daniels-Midland's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Archer-Daniels-Midland.How Are Returns Trending?Archer-Daniels-Midland is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 12%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 30% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.On a separate but related note, it's important to know that Archer-Daniels-Midland has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 40%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 106% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Archer-Daniels-Midland does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland  that you might be interested in.While Archer-Daniels-Midland may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The eventual value of the stock awards will depend on the company’s financial performance from 2022 through 2024.A Southwest spokesman said Jordan's cash bonus would have been larger without the December disruptions because of lower scores for financial performance and customer-satisfaction, but the cancellations did not affect his other compensation.A winter storm just before Christmas caused chaos across the airline industry, but Southwest took longer to recover than any of its rivals, as a crew-scheduling system was unable to keep up. The airline wound up canceling 16,700 flights in late December. The airline said the breakdown cost it about $800 million in lost revenue in the fourth quarter and up to $350 million more early this year.Bonuses declined for three other executives listed in the proxy, but Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson — who, like Jordan, got promoted last year — got a larger bonus than in 2021.Dallas-based Southwest earned $539 million last year despite a $220 million fourth-quarter loss.

But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) share price return of 31% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 0.6% over twelve months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Philip Morris International achieved compound earnings per share growth of 8.0% per year. We note that the 10% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Philip Morris International the TSR over the last 3 years was 55%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Philip Morris International has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 4.7% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 6% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Philip Morris International is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Philip Morris (PM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.39 a share.PM has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.83%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.39 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.PM is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Colgate-Palmolive (CL).Slated to report earnings on May 5, 2023, Colgate-Palmolive holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.71 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate-Palmolive is $0.70, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.98%.Story continuesPM and CL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

78,11c14e3b-105f-3698-adbb-7b2255e3e642,WU,2023-04-08,Investors in Western Union (NYSE:WU) have unfortunately lost 36% over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-western-union-nyse-wu-150457588.html,1680879897,STORY,['WU'],"[For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) shareholders, since the share price is down 45% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 53%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 42% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 22% in the last three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Western Union's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 0.6% each year. The share price decline of 18% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 4.54.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Western Union has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Western Union will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Western Union, it has a TSR of -36% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 9.6% in the twelve months, Western Union shareholders did even worse, losing 37% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Western Union (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.PPG Industries (PPG) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this paint and coatings maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for PPG Industries is 2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.3%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, PPG Industries has an S/TA ratio of 0.83, which means that the company gets $0.83 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.69, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And PPG Industries looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 3.9% this year versus the industry average of 3.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for PPG Industries have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.3% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made PPG Industries a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that PPG Industries is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In order to skip ahead, take a look at the Credit Suisse’s Top 5 Highest Conviction Picks.Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) has always been on the radars due to the fact that it’s one of the oldest and largest banks in Switzerland, which also classifies as a SIFI (systemically important financial institution). However, in the past few months the bank has been in the limelight for totally different reasons. The bank has been struggling financially and in February 2023, Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) reported an annual loss of CHF 7.3 billion ($7.95 billion), the biggest loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Later in March, the financial institution published its 2022 annual report, in which it stated that it had identified “material weaknesses” in controls over financial reporting.“The material weaknesses that have been identified relate to the failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements in its financial statements and the failure to design and maintain effective monitoring activities relating to (i) providing sufficient management oversight over the internal control evaluation process to support the Group’s internal control objectives; (ii) involving appropriate and sufficient management resources to support the risk assessment and monitoring objectives; and (iii) assessing and communicating the severity of deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action.”As a result, Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) had to revise its consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2021.Credit Suisse’s 12 Highest-Conviction Top Pickspichetw/Shutterstock.comOn the back of the financial struggles, Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS)’s stock price has declined by more than 71% since the beginning of the year, including a 64.5% drop recorded since March 14, when the annual report was published. The drop was further fueled by the bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, stating that it wouldn’t be able to provide more financial aid. Despite Credit Suisse borrowing an additional CHF 50 billion from the Swiss National Bank and attempting to undertake other measures, the panic among its clients and investors was unstoppable. On March 19, another Swiss bank, UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) announced a deal to acquire Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) for around $3.25 billion, which represented a 60% discount to the stock’s last closing price. In an attempt to halt the financial crisis triggered by the failure of two American Banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the Swiss government even changed the laws to fast track the acquisition by excluding the requirement of shareholders’ approval.Story continuesHowever, the completion of the deal is still clouded in uncertainty after on April 2, Swiss Federal Prosecutor’s office announced that it had opened an investigation into possible illegal activity related to the takeover and, in particular, the government’s support for the deal.Credit Suisse’s Highest-Conviction Top Picks: In RetrospectNevertheless, as stated earlier, prior to its untimely demise, Credit Suisse was one of the most watched financial institutions in the world and it has been regularly issuing reports in which it outlined some of its top conviction stock picks. At Insider Monkey, we have taken Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS)’s US Top Picks from July 2022 and decided to look into their performance since then. Out of 38 stocks that the bank highlighted in the report, we selected 12 companies that Credit Suisse mentioned as “above consensus calls”. Moreover, 5 of these stocks made it to the bank’s so-called “top of the crop” list, as they not only are ranked as “Outperform”, but also have least demanding market expectations. These stocks can be found under Credit Suisse’s Top 5 Highest Conviction Picks.Without any further ado, let’s dive in and see how Credit Suisse’s 12 Highest-Conviction Top Picks have fared since the bank highlighted them in July 2022.12. American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT)Stock performance since July 2022: -20.92%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 61Let’s kick off with American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT), on which Swiss bank had a price target of $313 in July 2022, which at the time implied an upside potential of around 22.5%. Analysts suggested that American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) was well positioned to benefit from growth in capital expenditures of US carriers, as well as improving dynamics in Europe, which could position the operator of wireless communications infrastructure for further expansion in that market.In the meantime, American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT)’s stock has slumped by nearly 21%, failing to deliver on Credit Suisse’s target. In February, the Real Estate Investment Trust reported a net loss of $1.47 per share, missing the estimates by $2.52, although the revenue of $2.71 billion was slightly higher than expected. All in all, analysts remain bullish on American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) in the long-run, with most having a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. In addition, being a REIT, American Tower Corp pays a solid quarterly dividend of $1.56 per share, ranking among our selection of 10 Best Stocks for Dividends.Among hedge funds followed by Insider Monkey, 61 reported long positions in American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) as of the end of 2022, with a cumulative value of $3.38 billion.11. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Stock performance since July 2022: -5.72%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 240Next in our list of Credit Suisse’s 12 Highest-Conviction Top Picks is tech behemoth Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), whose stock edged down by 5.72% since July 2022. Credit Suisse believed that Amazon is positioned to return to “historical levels of fulfillment center efficiency by 2024, certainly by 2025.” Therefore, analysts had a price target of $185 per share, which following some updates has recently been restated down to $171, although the bank continues to maintain an Outperform rating on the stock.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the highest-conviction picks not just at Credit Suisse, as confirmed by the fact that the company is one of the most popular among hedge funds, with a whooping 240 smart money investors in our database having amassed $27.54 billion worth of shares at the end of the last year. Among the most notable shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management, each holding 10.67 million shares and 901,500 shares, respectively.In its fourth-quarter investor letter, Baron Opportunity Fund also highlighted Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), saying:We believe that Amazon is well positioned to improve profitability back to historical levels, particularly in its core North American retail division. We have already seen some of this play out with reports of Amazon’s increased cost discipline and broad-based layoffs. Particularly within the internet and software sectors, we believe Amazon can sustain premium growth compared to the rest of the market, given its competitive strengths and scale. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it has less than 15% penetration in its TAM [Total Available Market], and cloud, where it is a clear leader in the vast and growing cloud infrastructure market.”10. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)Stock performance since July 2022: 30.72%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 42Then there’s Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), on which Credit Suisse was bullish saying that the company was on track to exceed its margins and accelerate unit growth. The stock of the fast food chain operator surged by more than 30% since July 2022, but is still below the bank’s price target of $2,200. During Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)’s earnings call for 2022, CEO Brian Niccol said that the company had delivered strong results the previous year, expanding its Average Unit Volume and restaurant-level margins, ""despite facing one of the highest inflationary periods on record and an uncertain macro environment.""“These results demonstrate Chipotle’s resiliency driven by our talented teams, delicious food made fresh daily, convenience, customization, and of course, our tremendous value.”Overall, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) posted 2022 sales of $8.6 billion, up by 14% on the year, but slightly lower than analysts had predicted. The company’s EPS of $8.29 missed the consensus by $0.60.There were 45 hedge funds in our database long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) at the end of December, which held $2.81 billion worth of shares, according to the latest round of 13F filings.9. International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT)Stock performance since July 2022: 38.86%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 27On International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT), Credit Suisse had a price target of $62 back in July 2022 and earlier this year it has revised it higher to $66, which is one of the highest price targets on the Street. By comparison, Deutsche Bank has a price target of $33. Even though the stock of the gambling technology company has gained 39% since July 2022, it still has to more than double in value to achieve Credit Suisse’s target. The Swiss bank considers that International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) deserves the Outperform rating due to lottery market strength from which the company is expected to benefit. In addition, International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) announced back in 2021 that it planned to spin off its digital and betting segments, and Credit Suisse considered that the potential transaction was not reflected in the company’s price back in July.Being a fairly small company (market cap around $5.2 billion), International Game Technology PLC (NYSE:IGT) was included in the portfolios of just 27 hedge funds at the end of 2022 , with largest position being held by Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group (2.53 million shares worth $57.38 million). Another investor in the company, Palm Harbour Capital mentioned IGT in its fourth-quarter letter, saying:“It is worth noting that management hit their 2025 leverage target more than two years in advance, while returning $224 million to shareholders through mid-October 2022. Management confirmed the upper half of their fiscal year 2022 guidance which combined with an improved credit profile drove the share price higher. We still find the steady cashflows and low valuation very compelling.”8. Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR)Stock performance since July 2022: -17.80%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 22With just 22 funds holding long positions as of the end of 22, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) is the least popular stock among Credit Suisse’s 12 Highest-Conviction Top Picks. Shares of the REIT are down by 18% since July 2022. In its report, Credit Suisse said that it believed that Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) was positioned to see an increase in its senior housing segment to pre-COVID levels in 2023 and to continue to grow. Another investor bullish on Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) is Baron Funds, which highlighted the REIT in its “Baron Real Estate Income Fund” investor letter for the fourth quarter:“The company’s scale allows it to swiftly act on large investment opportunities. We believe the company’s senior housing portfolio, which represents approximately 45% of assets, should deliver improved operating results in the next few years. […] The long-term demand outlook is favorable, driven in part by growth of the 80-plus population which is expected to accelerate in the years ahead.”In March, Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, unchanged from the previous, which gives the stock a forward dividend yield of 4.22%.7. T-Mobile Us Inc (NYSE:TMUS)Stock performance since July 2022: 5.87%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 94Telecom T-Mobile Us Inc (NYSE:TMUS) also made the list of Credit Suisse’s 12 Highest-Conviction Top Picks in its July 2022 report, with the bank’s analysts having set a price target of $188 amid belief that the company would continue to gain market share and benefit from synergies from the 2020 merger with Sprint Corporation.Last month, T-Mobile Us Inc (NYSE:TMUS) announced that it would acquire Mint Mobile, a budget mobile carrier that is partially owned by renowned actor Ryan Reynolds. The deal valued at up to $1.35 billion is expected to close later this year and is subject to Mint’s performance.There were 94 funds tracked by Insider Monkey with long positions in T-Mobile Us Inc (NYSE:TMUS), including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which disclosed a $733.88 million stake in its latest 13F filing. This ranks T-Mobile Us Inc (NYSE:TMUS) among the 5 Best Communication Stocks to Buy Now.6. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)Stock performance since July 2022: 9.32%Number of Bullish Hedge Funds: 74Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has seen its stock gain more than 9% since July 2022 and it's still below the Swiss bank’s price target of $430. In its report, Credit Suisse said that it believed Goldman Sachs’s business were growth businesses and its investments will provide returns through a more resilient earnings stream. Amid the decline of the whole banking segment triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the depreciation of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)’s shares put it at a P/E of 10.86 making it quite attractive at these levels. The stock also has a forward dividend yield of 3.06%, which justifies Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ranking among 5 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy.At the end of 2022, there were 74 funds in our database that held shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) with a total value of $4.90 billion.

For the sake of this article, I’ll be picking seven of the best companies from Morningstar’s 5-star stock category, as these come from the small list of companies that their analysts believe are trading at dramatic discounts to fair value.CCitigroup$45.90AVTAvnet$44.06BRBroadridge Financial Solutions$143.35PYPLPayPal$75.37GPNGlobal Payments$103.81SABRSabre $7.20VZVerizon Communications$39.36Citigroup (C)bank customer sliding money to teller at bank deskSource: Syda Productions / Shutterstock.comCitigroup (NYSE:C) has a reputation for running into trouble. The bank played its cards poorly during the 2008 financial crisis, and it has had several other reputational stumbles since that point.That said, at some price, a firm’s issues are reflected in the valuation, and Citigroup is at that point.C stock tumbled once again in March following the broader concerns around the health of the American banking sector. The too-big-to-fail banks such as Citigroup should benefit as deposits move from regional banks to national banks. In a crisis, it’s better to be big, and Citigroup is one of the nation’s largest retail banks and is third in overall asset size.Story continuesThe valuation has also gotten silly. Shares are going for just half of book value. The stock is also selling for just seven times forward earnings. This sets Citigroup up to both repurchase stock and pay a 4.4% dividend yield. Morningstar believes C stock is worth $75, making it among the most undervalued stocks out there.Avnet (AVT)The logo for Avnet (AVT) is seen on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAvnet (NASDAQ:AVT) is an electronics distribution firm, focusing on reselling semiconductor chips and equipment. Its advantage comes from scale. There are few players that have as broad a reach and depth of connections in its industry. To that point, Avnet generates roughly $25 billion in annual revenues.But, given the current glut in the semiconductor market, traders have refused to give Avnet the valuation multiple it deserves, which is what puts it among the most undervalued stocks.In fact, astonishingly enough, AVT stock is selling at just six times forward earnings. Sure, the semiconductor cycle is currently on the downswing. But, distributors take much less risk than the actual manufacturers or chip designers. Avnet has proven to be robust in past semiconductor cycles.And, in the meantime, the company is returning cash to shareholders both via a 2.5% dividend and its huge buyback program. The company bought back 8% of its outstanding shares in the past 12 months alone. That’s what makes it one of the most undervalued stocks you’re missing out on.Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)3d render illustration of bank symbols of various size. Earnings reports soon.Source: Hermin / Shutterstock.comBroadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is an unheralded financial services company. The firm is integral to much of what makes Wall Street tick.It got its start as a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). ADP had built up an operation to process shareholder proxy statements that didn’t fit with its core payroll business. And thus, Broadridge was born.In subsequent years, Broadridge has added management and document processing for wealth managers, investment banks, and other such financial professionals. It also maintains a near monopoly on proxy services.This is an ideal sort of business. It provides an integral service to brokerages, investment banks and other end clients. And its fees are low enough to not be a meaningful part of its customers’ bottom line. And, with minimal competition, Broadridge has been able to maintain fat profit margins.Broadridge shares have traded flat since 2020 while earnings growth continues to hum along. As a result, shares are now going for just 21 times forward earnings. Morningstar believes shares are worth $185, versus a current price of $145. Given Broadridge’s tremendous earnings growth track record, investors are likely to bid the company back up to a more generous valuation in due time.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seemed like an obvious winner in 2020. With people stuck at home, they’d have to move much of their financial lives to digital means. It wasn’t just e-commerce, PayPal seemed prepared to benefit from trends such as remote work and employers looked for new ways of hiring and paying their employees.However, the early surge in transaction volumes seen in 2020 and 2021 quickly faded. Along with that, the tech industry went into a tailspin. PYPL stock plunged from a high of $300 to just $76 today.That seems like an overreaction. Unlike many tech peers, PayPal is profitable. Shares are going for just 16 times forward earnings today. I’d also note that the company is continuing to grow revenues at nearly 10% a year, and analysts expect earnings growth of at least 10% annually going forward.PayPal’s core business, while slower, is still showing steady growth. The stock price, however, would suggest that things were far worse than they actually are. To that point, Morningstar believes PYPL stock is worth $135 per share which offers tremendous upside from today’s price.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) has gotten caught up in the same storm as PayPal. However, it’s arguably in an even better position. Unlike PayPal, nothing has gone wrong with Global Payments’ core business.That business, merchant acquiring, is attractive. Global Payments serves as a middleman between the credit card companies and vendors such as restaurants and retail stores. Global Payments provides payment terminals and related services such as fraud prevention, tax and accounting reporting, and transaction analysis.The payments industry has plummeted since 2021 thanks to firms like PayPal coming up short of investors’ lofty expectations. GPN stock has lost more than half its value since its peak two years ago.The thing is, Global Payments hasn’t had its operations impaired. In fact, earnings are continuing to grow at a double-digit clip, even as the stock price has plummeted. GPN stock now trades at just 10 times forward earnings. Morningstar’s Brett Horn believes shares are fully 41% undervalued today.Sabre Corp (SABR)A photo of a woman in a face mask waiting to board an airplane.Source: Maridav/ShutterStock.comSabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the three primary global distribution systems (GDS) for airlines, hotels, and other travel industry companies. GDS operators serve as a marketplace between airlines, cruise lines, passenger railroads, etc. on one side, and buyers such as travel agents and online booking websites on the other.Sabre, and its two competitors, get a cut of every transaction that passes through these GDS ticketing platforms. As airline traffic has come roaring back over the past two years, it has given the GDS firms a tailwind.That said, Sabre has failed to capitalize so far. It invested heavily in upgrades to its tech infrastructure just prior to the pandemic. Business came to a halt before these upgrades could pay off; instead, Sabre ended up undercapitalised and in financial trouble.The company has struggled to get back on track and reach profitability. However, there’s a high-quality business lying under the surface here. Morningstar believes Sabre can take flight once again; its analyst pegs fair value at $10.50 versus today’s price in the low $4 range.Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of America’s three prominent mobile telephony providers. Traditionally, investors have gravitated to these companies thanks to their stable cash flows and large dividends.However, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) threw a spanner in the works when it slashed its dividend. Investors dumped both AT&amp;T and Verizon shares following that. But AT&amp;T’s problems were self-inflicted, related to that firm taking on excess debt to make unsuccessful acquisitions.Verizon, by contrast, is still in a strong competitive position. Yes, it has seen a slowdown in earnings growth recently. That has come as Verizon has invested heavily in 5G and other next-generational telecom infrastructure. However, these investments should pay off in due time. Meanwhile, VZ stock has gotten absolutely hammered over the past year, with shares losing nearly a quarter of their value.It’s rare that telecom companies end up being dramatically mis-priced. But Morningstar believes that is exactly the situation with Verizon today. Analyst Michael Hodel pegs fair value at $57 per share versus a current price of $39. The massive discount available today probably won’t last long, and in the meantime, shares offer a 6.7% dividend yield.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, GPN, BR stock.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. American International Group (AIG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.55 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2023.AIG has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.8%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.55 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49.AIG is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Wells Fargo (WFC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 14, 2023, Wells Fargo holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.25 a share seven days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo is $1.16, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 7.24%.Story continuesAIG and WFC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Hologic (HOLX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to HOLX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Hologic's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Hologic's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic Inc. develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women.Hologic operates through the following four segments:Diagnostics (55% of total revenues in FY22): With the Gen-Probe acquisition, Hologic currently offers APTIMA family of assays that includes the APTIMA Combo 2 assay, which feature the APTIMA CT and APTIMA GC assays, the APTIMA HPV assay and the APTIMA Trichomonas assay. Other products include the ThinPrep system, primarily used in cytology applications.Breast Health (29% of total revenues in FY22): Products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, computer-aided detection (CAD), breast biopsy guidance systems, minimally invasive breast biopsy and tissue extraction devices and breast brachytherapy products.GYN Surgical (14% of total revenues in FY22): Products include the NovaSure endometrial ablation system – used in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and the MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system – which allows incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus.Skeletal Health (2% of total revenues in FY22): This segment includes dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and Fluoroscan mini-C arm imaging products.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Hologic ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $3,827.25, or a 282.73% gain, as of April 7, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 164.28% and gold's return of 22.04% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for HOLX too.Hologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Both molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses grew strong. Excluding COVID impact, molecular diagnostics business grew primarily on more assays being run through the company’s expanded Panther installed base. GYN Surgical business grew nearly 9% organically as the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from the new business lines. In the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues, along with supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in the Breast Health business, dragged total revenues down. The company also reported a contraction in both margins.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.57%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Yet, tough competitive landscape and foreign exchange headwinds are major downsides. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past six months, QIAGEN has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 3.1% compared with the industry’s 0.6% rise.QIAGEN ended fourth-quarter 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The ongoing double-digit sales growth in the non-COVID product portfolio, a high level of profitability and strong cash flow are the major upsides. The QIAcuity digital PCR system delivered solid double-digit CER growth for fiscal 2022, supported by the launch of new assays for biopharma applications. Further, QuantiFERON-TB also registered a solid double-digit CER growth in 2022, led by continued conversion of the latent TB market from the traditional skin test.Molecular diagnostic solutions contributed about 30% to sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. The key driver of the growth was the QuantiFERON franchise. Sales of QuantiFERON TB test rose 15% at CER in the fourth quarter on double-digit gains in all regions. In terms of QIAstat-Dx, the company continued to witness increased demand for system placements and growing consumables usage around the world.QIAGEN is progressing well with its testing menu expansion strategy.In January 2023, QIAGEN launched EZ2 Connect MDx for use in diagnostic laboratories. This makes the in-vitro devices (IVD) platform for automated sample processing available for widescale use 18 months after being made available for research.The same month, QIAGEN announced an enhanced QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench Premium that removes the data-analysis bottleneck of next-generation sequencing by adding game-changing speed to analyze and interpret whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and large panel sequencing data.QIAGEN N.V. PriceQIAGEN N.V. PriceQIAGEN N.V. price | QIAGEN N.V. QuoteStory continuesOn the flip side, in the fourth quarter of 2022, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and sales both declined. The massive decline in COVID-19 product sales and severe foreign exchange headwind impacted overall performance.QIAGEN currently markets products in more than 100 countries. In the quarter under review, revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell 23%, reportedly due to the sharp decline in COVID testing trends. Revenues from Asia-Pacific/Japan fell 16% year over year on a reported basis. Sales in China declined by about 7% in the fourth quarter.Escalating costs and the contraction of gross margin operating margin are concerns.Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was much higher than the quarter-end cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments level, indicating a weak solvency position.A series of current macroeconomic issues, including supply chain disruptions, energy needs and rising inflation, continue to hamper the company’s performance. Apart from this, stiff competition from firms offering pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers persists.

These initiatives were piloted in select markets during the fourth quarter and, given early positive results, a strategic decision was made to expand these programs throughout the company’s America's Best brand in 2023.Further, the company also continues to roll out its remote care capabilities, which provide doctors with additional levels of flexibility and expand exam capacity in many areas. By the end of 2022, National Vision rolled out remote care capabilities to approximately 300 stores.Story continuesOn the flip side, National Vision reported dismal fourth-quarter 2022 results, with lower-than-expected revenues. The company reported an adjusted loss in the reported quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the company reported a significant decline in the top- and bottom-line numbers. According to the company, net revenues were negatively impacted by the timing of unearned revenues.The company is facing demand headwinds across its network of stores, given the current macro environment, as well as a supply challenge in a smaller subgroup of stores due to the constraints on eye exam capacity. Contraction of both margins on escalating expenses is discouraging.We note that earlier this year, given the current inflationary environment, the company implemented the first pricing change to America's Best signature offer in more than 15 years.Over the past year, National Vision’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 58.9% compared with the industry’s 38.5% decline.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

AVNS has been gaining from its impressive product line. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and continued focus on its Research and Development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and uncertainty in the healthcare industry persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 10.2% compared with 17.1% decline of the industry and 9.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device solutions provider has a market capitalization of $1.42 billion. The company projects 1.8% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Avanos’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Portfolio: Avanos’ robust product suite raises our optimism. On the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call in February, Avanos’ management confirmed that within the Digested Health portfolio, NeoMed grew nearly 4% globally, fueled by strong execution of customer conversions to ENFit technology. At constant exchange rate, the adjusted portfolio grew by double digits, with NeoMed growing nearly 40%. The positive trends across the company’s Digestive Health franchise continued as second-half supply improvements enabled Avanos to maximize North American ENFit conversions.Focus on R&amp;D: We are upbeat about Avanos’ continued focus on its R&amp;D wing to commercialize new products, and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of the existing ones. The company has been investing to expand the indications for the use of its pain products with clinical research and studies, as well as associated new product developments. It is also expanding its portfolio with customer-preferred product enhancements.Strong Q4 Results: Avanos’ robust fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company saw year-over-year improvement in the overall top and bottom lines. The strength in Avanos’ core Pain Management and Chronic Care segments was also seen. Growth in Acute Pain and Interventional Pain solutions was registered. The expansion of both margins was also recorded.Story continuesDownsidesUncertainty in Healthcare Industry: Various government authorities periodically review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods. Avanos cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by the governments, or what ultimate effect healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on the company’s customers’ purchasing decisions regarding its products. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for Avanos’ products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect its business.Competition: Avanos faces significant competition in both the United States and international markets. Competitors of its products are fragmented by particular product categories and the individual markets for these products are also highly competitive. Such an intensely competitive landscape is likely to put pressure on margins.Estimate TrendAvanos is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.4% north to $1.68.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $194.7 million, suggesting a 1.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our first-quarter revenue estimate of $194.4 million, suggesting a 1.5% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

ZBH is gaining from strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in the knee and hip businesses. The company has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets. However, consistent foreign exchange woes and stiff competition do not bode well.The renowned musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $26.98 billion. The company has a long-term projected growth of 6.2% compared with the industry’s growth projection of 14.6%. The stock has declined 1.1% compared with a 38.9% fall in the industry and a 10% decline in the S&amp;P 500.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.Factors At PlayBusiness Recovery Continues: Zimmer Biomet witnessed a rebound in its business in the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges.In fourth-quarter 2022, U.S. sales rose 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in Zimmer Biomet’s Knee and Hip businesses. The global knees business rose 10.2%, with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%. The strong performance was driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside the United States. Global hips increased 8.4%, with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the United States.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on Emerging Markets to Drive Growth: In the recent past, Zimmer Biomet has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. The company's strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. While the integration of Biomet is over, the combined company has started to get benefitted from a strong presence in emerging markets with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints.Story continuesMarkets opportunity is expected to grow to $66.6 billion by 2025 for the orthopedic implants globally. Within the emerging market, we note that strength in the Asia Pacific market has continued to drive strong revenue growth. Post the COVID-19 mayhem, Zimmer Biomet is expected to continue with this trend, banking on a cadence of product launches and strong customer adoptions.Dental and Spine Spin-Off to Bode Well: Zimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm. According to Zimmer Biomet management, this planned spin-off of its Spine and Dental business is part of the company’s third phase of ongoing transformation, which includes changing the complexion of the business through active portfolio management to accelerate growth and drive value creation. Per management, the transaction is an important next step in its transition into a more streamlined company with a focus on greater and more optimized resource allocation toward innovation in core businesses that are profitable and where it sees attractive markets with opportunities to become market leaders.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry is highly competitive with players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. Zimmer Biomet must constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Exposed to Currency Movement: Zimmer Biomet records a significant portion of its sales from the international market. This makes it highly exposed to currency fluctuations.Estimate TrendZimmer Biomet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has moved 1.4% north to $7.04.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.13 billion, suggesting a 2.8% rise from the 2022 reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HOLX) stock is up an impressive 123% over the last five years. We note the stock price is up 3.6% in the last seven days.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Hologic There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Hologic achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 0.8% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Hologic has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store?

100,0db7c3f1-21f1-32f8-937a-dde75e14d330,NFLX,2023-04-08,Netflix (NFLX) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-nflx-upgraded-buy-does-160004778.html,1680883204,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix (NFLX) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Netflix is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Netflix, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for NetflixThis internet video service is expected to earn $11.28 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 13.4%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Netflix. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Netflix to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I know you wrote up a piece on a Jefferies note that was out today. We will be getting earnings results from Netflix in just about two weeks. What can we expect there?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, well, Jefferies saying that earnings, it's not really going to be the main story here for Netflix. Rather, the bank is focusing more on that password chain crackdown, the recently launched ad-supported tier. Jefferies saying that those two revenue drivers will be a reacceleration of growth that we'll see towards the end of this year and well into 2024. They said that we're still in the early days of both of those growth initiatives, but any commentary that will get on the earnings call in two weeks on conversion, churn, and/or adoption will be very important.In the meantime, Jefferies did say that investors will likely have to battle a lot of noise, especially in the second quarter, but they are encouraging investors to buy the dip there, saying that these are longer term catalysts and any immediate knee-jerk reaction is going to settle over the long-term. So that's going to be a very interesting earnings report. And we'll be tracking it very closely for any more specific commentary, particularly about password sharing and how the ad tier is doing.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, can't wait for that.

Today’s energy sector, however, includes crude oil and natural gas extraction, gas liquefaction, the huge web of the midstream transport and storage networks, the refineries that churn out usable fuels and chemicals, and the related petrochemical industry pervading most aspects of our lives. Such a diverse economic sector will bring along unparalleled arrays of investment opportunities.In a recent note on the refining sector, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta outlined the factors that investor should look at in energy stocks: “We believe this environment allows for companies with accelerating capital returns and strong operations to outperform, as well as those with steadier earnings contribution from non-refining segments and attractive capital returns profiles to outperform.”Against the backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts have pointed out potential two energy winners for the months ahead. Both are Buy-rated names with double-digit upside potential, and offer a small dividend as a bonus. Let’s take a closer look.Phillips 66 (PSX)First up is Houston-based Phillips 66, an oil major that saw total revenues exceed $111 billion in 2021 and jump to $170 billion in 2022. The company has a presence in most aspects of the oil and gas industries. Phillips brings crude oil and gas products to the refineries, and markets a wide range of fuel products, as well as lubricating oils, industrial chemicals, and petrochemicals.Phillips currently operates 13 refineries, which together produce a wide range of fuels and fuel oils that the company markets under multiple brand names. The Phillips 66 shield – the ubiquitous gas station sign modeled on interstate highway numbers – is recognized across the country, as are names like Conoco and 76. In addition, Phillips produces fuels for the aviation industry, and its chemical products can be found in industry, agribusiness, and the medical and pharmaceutical sectors.Story continuesTurning to Phillips’ financial results, the company saw non-GAAP EPS of $4 in 4Q22, up 35% year-over-year. While impressive, that figure came in below the consensus estimate of $4.35. The company has plenty of cash resources, and finished 2022 with $12.8 billion in liquid assets, including $6.1 billion in cash. This total included the $4.8 billion in operating cash flow generated in Q4.Management authorized a $5 billion increase to the firm’s share repurchase program, and in the most recent declaration the company raised its dividend payment by 8 cents, or 8.2%, to $1.05 per common share. The annualized dividend now yields 4%.Among the bulls is Goldman’s Neil Mehta, who writes of Phillips: “Our top pick in the group remains Phillips 66, which is on the Americas Conviction List. On our 2024 estimates, PSX trades at only 8.3X P/E compared to the sector average of 10.6X P/E, representing an attractive entry point…”“We see room for investors to get more positive on the outlook for medium and longer term business transformation, with potential upside in earnings forecasts to the extent the company delivers on its cost reduction targets and any potential uplift from the recently announced DCP transaction,” the analyst added.To this end, Mehta rates PSX shares a Buy along with a $125 price target. The figure implies shares will be valued 22% higher in a year’s time. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)Overall, PSX shares have a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 6 Buys to 4 Holds. The stock’s average price target stands at $128.80 and implies a 25% upside from the current share price of $102.84. (See PSX stock forecast)Shell plc (SHEL)Shell is one of the world’s largest oil companies, a mega-cap firm with a $200 billion market cap. Shell is also one of the oil sector’s most diversified companies, with its operations divided into four segments: Upstream, Integrated Gas, Renewables &amp; Energy Solutions, and Downstream. Operations in these segments include everything from exploration and extraction activities, to natural gas liquefaction and delivery, to renewable hydrogen and low-carbon power production, to fuel and energy delivery to more than 32 million customers.Outside of these activities, Shell also has a Projects &amp; Technology division that drives the company’s research and innovation projects into new solutions for energy tech. In addition, Projects &amp; Tech also provides needed technical capabilities and services in the operational divisions.These combined operations brought Shell a total of $101.3 billion in top-line revenues for 4Q22, the most recent period reported, up 18% year-over-year – and beating the forecast by an impressive $59.97 billion.At the bottom line, Shell had $9.8 billion in adjusted earnings for 4Q22, up 3.1% y/y. Drilling down, this income gave an adjusted EPS of $1.39. The bottom-line EPS compares favorably to the $0.83 from 4Q21 – but even so, the 4Q22 EPS was 92 cents below expectations.Even with the mixed quarterly results, Shell saw fit to raise its dividend in Q4, bumping it up from 25 cents per common share to 28.75 cents, an increase of 15%. The new payment annualizes to $1.15 and yields 2%.Covering this stock for Goldman, analyst Michele Della Vigna writes: “We believe the company has the highest quality combination of assets in the sector, with a leading global LNG and marketing businesses and strong chemical presence. We see material upside to operational performance in both deepwater and LNG assets, while the company’s strong balance sheet might allow it to veer towards the upper end of the sector’s new 30-40% cash distribution range…”Della Vigna goes on to rate SHEL as a Buy, and he sets a price target of $85 to suggest a 40% potential upside on the one-year time frame. (To watch Della Vigna’s track record, click here)Overall, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. The rating is based on 7 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares have an average price target of $69.01, implying ~14% upside from the current trading price of $60.57.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.We also note that PSX holds a PEG ratio of 0.35. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.58. Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.58.Finally, we should also recognize that PSX has a P/CF ratio of 3.68. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PSX's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.23. Over the past 52 weeks, PSX's P/CF has been as high as 11.91 and as low as 3.23, with a median of 4.45.Investors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Valero Energy are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 5.73 and a PEG ratio of 0.96 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 5.82 and 0.58, respectively.Story continuesOver the past year, VLO's P/E has been as high as 12.62, as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.29; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.10, as low as 0.73, with a median of 0.58 during the same time period.Additionally, Valero Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.86 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.25. For VLO, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.70, with a median of 2.01 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Phillips 66 and Valero Energy are likely undervalued currently.

This provides significant opportunities for ExxonMobil’s Low Carbon Solution business.ExxonMobil’s latest investment is about 40% of its overall $17 billion allocated to low-emission initiatives through 2027.

The company’s refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. Valero, with ownership interests in 15 petroleum refineries, has a combined throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day.Valero boasts that its premium refining operations are resilient even when the business operating environment is carbon-constrained. Its refining business has the capabilities to generate handsome cashflows, which will allow it to return capital to shareholders and back growth projects.Valero’s renewable diesel segment involves the Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture, which is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America. The joint venture is between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero. Low-carbon fuel policies across the globe are primarily aiding the demand for renewable diesel, driving Valero’s Renewable Diesel business.With the commissioning of the DGD Port Arthur facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, DGD’s combined renewable diesel production capacity increased by 470 million gallons per year to 1.2 billion gallons per year. In 2023, Valero’s renewable diesel margins are expected to be consistent with the current levels.Valero’s board of directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend from 98 cents per share to $1.02. The dividend hike raises the company’s annualized cash dividend rate to $4.08 per share.Valero’s commitment to the energy transition is commendable. The company is on track to reduce and displace Refinery GHG emissions by 63% through investments in board-approved projects by 2025.

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Phillips 66 (PSX) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 5.2% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this oil refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PSX meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PSX is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.38. This indicates that the stock moves 38% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PSX has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PSX earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks.

However, volatility reappeared in early April even though this month generally remains favorable to stock investors.On Apr 3, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its associate members decided to reduce aggregate production by 1.16 million barrels per day starting May. The new quota system will continue till the end of 2023.This was followed by Russia’s decision to cut crude oil production by 500,000 barrels per day till the end of 2023. Saudi Arabia said the decision of OPEC+ is a “precautionary measure” aimed at stabilizing the global oil market in case of a recession in 2023.Following the news, the future price of the U.S. benchmark — the West Texas Intermediate crude — and the global benchmark — the Brent crude — climbed to their highest level since April 2022. Several economists and financial researchers have indicated that crude oil prices could reach $100 per barrel in the near future.Oil price is one of the major sources of inflation. Market participants are worried that inflation rate, which has declined considerably since its peak in June 2022, may spike once again. Despite the decline, the aggregate price level remains elevated.Moreover, the resilient U.S. labor market has recently shown weakness. In its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, the Department of Labor reported that job openings in February came in at 9.93 million, declining 632,000 from January’s downwardly revised data. For the first time since May 2021, job vacancies fell below 10 million.The ADP private payrolls for March were below the consensus estimate. The weekly jobless claims for the last two reported weeks came in at higher-than expected. The ISM reported that the manufacturing index for March dropped to 46.3%, marking its lowest level since May 2020 when the industrial sector was facing pandemic-related lockdowns.Stocks in WatchAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe that one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are The TJX Companies Inc. TJX, Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, Sandstorm Gold Ltd.

From there, they operate heavy machinery that digs out the coal and moves the precious resource above ground. It is hard work, the miners said, but essential to keep the country going.“Today, the country’s energy independence is more than a priority,” said Oleksandr, the chief engineer, who, like all the coal miners interviewed, spoke on the condition of giving only his first name for security reasons.Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s nuclear, thermal and other power stations continue to disrupt electricity service as the war grinds on for a second year.Negotiations to demilitarize the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which the Kremlin's forces captured last year at the start of the full-scale invasion, are at an impasse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opposes any proposal that would legitimize Russian control of the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear energy facility.At full capacity, the plant can produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity. The Ukrainian operators of the plant shut down the last reactor in September, saying it was too risky to run while Russia bombarded nearby areas.Shelling has damaged the plant numerous times, raising fears of a possible nuclear meltdown. Russian missiles have also threatened the power lines needed to operate vital cooling equipment at Zaporizhzhia and Ukraine's other nuclear plants.Before the war, the Ukrainian government planned to reduce the country's reliance on coal-fired power stations, which contribute to global warming, and to increase nuclear energy and natural gas production. But when Russian attacks damaged thermal plants in the middle of winter, it was coal that helped keep Ukrainian homes warm, Oleksandr said.Story continuesThe work of the coal miners cannot fully compensate for the loss of energy from nuclear power plants, but every megawatt they had a role in generating reduced gaps.“We come and work with optimism, trying not to think about what is going on outside the mine,” a miner named Serhii said. “We work with a smile and forget about it. And when we leave, then another life begins (for us), of survival and everything else.”While many miners from the area joined the armed forces when Russian troops invaded and are now fighting at the front in eastern Ukraine, nearly 150 displaced workers from other coal-producing regions in the east joined the team in Dnipropetrovsk.A man named Yurii left the embattled Donetsk province town of Vuhledar, where he worked as a coal miner for 20 years. “The war, of course, radically changed my life,” he said. “It is now impossible to live there and the mine where I used to work.”“Life begins from scratch,” he said.British military analysts reported Saturday that they think Russia’s campaign to degrade Ukraine’s energy grid over the winter through intense missile and drone strikes “highly likely failed,” and that the invaded country’s energy situation would improve as temperatures rise.The U.K. Defense Ministry said that while the strikes have continued since October, large-scale attacks causing significant infrastructure damage are becoming rare. Ukraine’s network operators also managed to source replacement transformers and other “critical” components to keep electricity flowing, the ministry said.___Samya Kallab contributed to this story from Kyiv, Ukraine.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine]"

OPEC nations pursued the cutbacks following a momentary drop in oil prices during March's banking turmoil and fears of a recession that could hurt energy demand.Bloomberg's data shows that Russia pumped around 1.285 million tons of crude oil a day, or over 9.4 million barrels. At the same time, exports of the commodity grew considerably, up 4.13 million barrels a day in the last week of March.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

All the six Gulf Arab states--Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman--are on track to post budget surpluses, many for the first time in a decade thanks to buoyant oil prices and years of fiscal reforms.But it’s not just the Arabian oil giants that will be enjoying the good times. In its latest forecast, the World Bank has predicted that in 2023, the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will grow 3.5%, more than twice the global average growth rate of 1.7% thanks mainly to high energy prices and increased oil production. GCC growth is expected to stabilize at 3.7% this year after expanding at a blistering 6.9% clip in 2022.Diversification and Sustainability Remain KeyAlthough hydrocarbons remain the backbone of MENA’s economy, the realities of climate change as well as wild oil price swings have been forcing Gulf nations to restrategize and diversify their economies away from oil--and Saudi Arabia is leading the way, again.Although Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman recently made waves in the oil community after telling Bloomberg News that Saudi Arabia intends to pump every last drop of oil and is going to be the last man standing, Saudi Arabia has crafted one of the most ambitious clean energy blueprints: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 economic plan.In the economic plan, Saudi Arabia has set a target to develop ~60 GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, which compares with an installed capacity of roughly 80 GW of power plants burning gas or oil.Story continuesSo far, Saudi Arabia has only made limited progress deploying renewables with just 520 MW of utility-scale solar in operation while 400 MW of wind power is under construction.With its sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes, Saudi Arabia is prime real estate for renewable energy generation. Last year, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco sent shockwaves through the natural gas markets after it announced that it was kicking off the biggest shale gas development outside of the United States. Saudi Aramco said it plans to spend $110 billion over the next couple of years to develop the Jafurah gas field, which is estimated to hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. The state-owned company hopes to start natural gas production from Jafurah in 2024 and reach 2.2 Bcf/d of sales gas by 2036 with an associated 425 million cubic feet per day of ethane.Two years ago, Aramco announced that instead of chilling all that gas and exporting it as LNG, it will convert it into a much cleaner fuel: Blue hydrogen.Saudi Aramco has  told investors that Aramco has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Nasser said that the kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR) with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet.Last year, Aramco made the world’s first blue ammonia shipment--from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan--a country whose mountainous terrain and extreme seismic activity render it unsuitable for the development of sustainable renewable energy--is looking for dependable suppliers of hydrogen fuel with Saudi Arabia and Australia on its shortlist.The Saudi government is also building a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce green hydrogen.But here’s the main kicker: Helios could soon produce green hydrogen that’s cheaper than oil.Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates that Helios’ costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land.Germany has said it needs “enormous” volumes of green hydrogen, and hopes Saudi Arabia will become a key supplier. Two years ago, Germany’s cabinet committed to invest €9B (about $10.2B) in hydrogen technology in a  bid to decarbonize the economy and cut CO2 emissions. The government has proposed to build an electrolysis capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 and another 5,000 MW by 2040 over the next decade to produce fuel hydrogen.The European economic powerhouse has realized it cannot do this alone, and will require low-cost suppliers like Saudi Arabia especially as it doubles down on its green energy commitments following a series of devastating floods in the country.UAE: Nuclear, Wind and Waste-to-EnergyBack in 2021, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) announced the commissioning of the country’s first-ever nuclear power plant--the Barakah unit 1.The 1,400-megawatt nuclear plant has become the single largest electricity generator in the UAE since reaching 100% power in early December, and is now providing ""constant, reliable and sustainable electricity around the clock.""ENEC says Barakah unit 1 is ""now leading the largest decarbonization effort of any industry in the UAE to date.""Following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia, the UAE is also laying a strong foundation for the energy transition.Masdar, the clean energy arm of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, is building renewable capacity in central Asia  after signing a deal in April 2021 to develop a solar project in Azerbaijan.Since its inception in 2006, Masdar has built a portfolio of renewable energy assets in 30 different countries, having invested about $20bn to develop 11GW of solar, wind and waste-to-energy power generation capacity.And now Masdar says it intends to apply the lessons gleaned abroad to develop clean energy capacity back at home. “Solutions we have developed in our international operations will definitely have applications here in the UAE”, says Masdar’s El-Ramahi.For instance, Masdar plans to bolster the UAE’s comparatively weak wind resources by developing domestic wind farms using the latest class three turbines that are able to harness electricity even from low wind speeds.Further, the company is also constructing a $1.1bn facility that will burn garbage to generate power in one of the world’s largest waste-to-energy plants. Once complete, the plants will incinerate almost two-thirds of the household  wastes the country generates every year.Though not typically considered a clean energy source, modern waste-to-energy plants are much cleaner as per the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). By using advanced technologies, these plants are able burn waste at extremely high temperatures thus ensuring complete combustion while missions are specially treated, leaving minimal amounts of toxic byproducts like flue ash. In fact, tests have shown that the air emitted by certain waste-to-energy chimneys can be cleaner than the air flowing in.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The UK Doing Enough To Achieve Its Ambitious Climate Pledges?Commercial Drones Poised To Disrupt Global Supply ChainsThe Middle East Is Investing Billions Into Desalination ProjectsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The compact, portable models have become popular for both novice and pro cooks alike, allowing them to host casual pizza parties or cater events as part of a restaurant business. While the wood- and gas-burning ovens can be fun to use for all skill levels, they have to remain outdoors, and using wood or charcoal requires more attention.After making some of the best outdoor pizza ovens, Ooni introduced its first electric model designed for indoor use in March. The Volt 12 ($999) encompasses everything from the company’s existing product line, from high-heat cooking to consistent results, and adds ease of use and baking versatility to the mix. This beast is big and expensive, but it also makes some damn good pizza.DesignOoni Volt 12 reviewThe Volt 12 looks like what I’d expect an electric pizza oven from Ooni to look like. It bears the most resemblance to the Karu 16, one of the largest models the company offers. The gray and black color scheme is on every current Ooni model, except for the all-silver multi-fuel Karu 12. Rather than a rectangle, the Volt 12 has angled corners, making it more of a flat octagon than a boring box. Ooni says the exterior is powder-coated and weather resistant so you can take it outdoors – not that you would want it to get too wet. Since this model is more of a countertop appliance than its open-flame predecessors, the Volt 12 has short, stubby legs rather than the longer, folding ones on the wood- and gas- burning units.Only three Ooni models have glass doors that allow you to watch the entire cooking process. As an electric, indoor oven, the Volt 12 is one of those. Unlike the Karu 16 and Karu 12G, this panel is gloss black instead of metal. The door has a robust black handle that remains cool to the touch, even at 850 degrees, and a row of three control dials sit beneath the glass window. The only other button is an on/off switch on the left side of the front. This turns off the power completely. When this is switched on, the oven sits in standby mode until you hit the power button on the front that actually gets the Volt 12 ready to use.On the left is the time dial with the power button above it. The center control is for temperature, which ranges from 350 to 850 degrees Fahrenheit. Lastly, the far right dial is for “balance,” allowing you to shift how much power is given to the top and bottom heating elements. In other words, you can put more emphasis on the stone for a crisper crust or more on the top for a bit more browning/char. The balance control also activates a boost feature that can be used to get the stone to return to target temp quickly between pizzas (it takes about 45 seconds). All three controls are flanked by white lights for precise level indications. During pre-heating, for example, the temperature dial starts at 350 and slowly moves around to your target, blinking along the way at the current status.The bottom heating element sits underneath the stone – a 13-inch square cooking surface that can accommodate a variety of pans in addition to 12-inch pizza. There’s also an interior light that stays on the whole time, making it very easy to see how things are progressing without having to open the door.Setup and useOoni Volt 12 reviewBefore the first use, you’ll need to season Volt 12. This requires you to run the oven at full blast (850) for 20 minutes and then allow it to cool before preheating to launch your first pizza. The cooldown takes quite a bit longer than the preheating or 20-minute burnoff, so you’ll want to do thing well before you need to actually cook. The cool down time on the Volt 12 takes a while. While the exterior will be back to room temp sooner, it takes a while for the inside to do the same since the Volt 12 is so well-insulated. This means you’ll have to wait at least an hour to safely store it or put the cover on.Ooni says the 1,600-watt Volt 12 can hit 850 degrees in 20 minutes where it can cook a pizza in 90 seconds. This makes it slightly slower to achieve max temperature than its wood- or gas-burning counterparts. The Karu 16, for example, can reach 950 degrees Fahrenheit in 15 minutes. Still, 20 minutes is remarkably quick, and in my experience, the Volt 12 actually hit 850 faster than that.The key advantage the Volt 12 has over its wood-burning siblings is convenience. Those models make great pizza with the subtle flavor of wood fire, but the flames require supervision whereas the Volt 12 is very much set it and forget it. You don’t have to worry about maintaining the fire in between stretching dough, topping pizzas and launching them into the oven. The Volt 12 also sets the balance dial based on your cooking temperature, but you can adjust it if you need to. Most outdoor Ooni ovens have an optional gas burner (propane and natural gas models), which would also remedy some of the headaches with temperature regulation.Making the pizzaOoni Volt 12 reviewAll of this sounds great on paper, but it would be for naught if the thing didn’t make good pizza. Thankfully, Ooni has translated its formula for excellent outdoor cooking to its electric oven. The Volt 12 produces comparable results to any of the company’s other models, right down to the char and leoparding on Neapolitan pies. Since the temperature dial gives you more precise control, it’s easier to achieve the desired cook on everything from New York style to thin-and-crispy. With the extra space inside, you can also make Detroit pan pizza, as well as roast and bake other items with ease. The Volt 12 did well with any type of crust I threw at it, churning out tasty pies consistently in just a few minutes.Running wide open at 850 degrees, the Volt 12 makes excellent Neapolitan-style pizza. You’ll need to make sure you have a proper dough recipe (Scott Deley’s The Ooni Pizza Project is a great guide), but assuming you're starting with a good base, the oven will do its thing well. I found that the Volt 12 is a little more forgiving with rotating the pies than the open-flame outdoor models, so you don’t need to babysit it quite as much. These pizzas were light and airy with a slight crispness to the bottom and the requisite leoparding. New York-style pizzas baked at 650 were also great, with crisp edges and bottom, with a pleasant chewiness to the crust.Ooni Volt 12 reviewThere are some downsides to the Volt 12, the big one being the price. It’s $999, and I’ll be the first to tell you that excellent pizza is achievable with your main oven and a baking stone or steel that costs a fraction as much. The second thing is it’s huge. The Volt 12 takes up the entire depth of the counter and is 20 inches wide. It also weighs just under 40 pounds. That’s not too heavy, relatively speaking, and the Volt 12 can easily be chucked in the backseat for a nearby party. Ooni did design it with built-in handles on the sides though, which makes the task of moving it slightly easier.The competitionIn the US, Ooni’s main competition for the Volt 12 is the Breville Pizzaiolo. This oven has been on the market for a few years at this point, with a design that looks more like one of the company’s toaster ovens. It’s an all-stainless steel aesthetic, with a glass door for viewing and easy-to-use controls up front. Out of the box, the Pizzaiolo runs on a variety of presets for different styles, but Breville also equipped it with a manual mode to give you full control over the top and bottom heating elements.The three strikes against this alternative are cost, a confining cooking surface and the lack of interior lighting. The Pizzaiolo is $999.95, so unless you find one on sale, you won’t save any money over the Volt 12. The stone on the Pizzaiolo is circular instead of square, so you’ll only be able to use 12-inch round pans in addition to your pizza. And lastly, there’s no light inside, so it can be a challenge to keep tabs on the cooking process. You’ll almost certainly have to open the door at some point for a closer inspection.Wrap-upWith the Volt 12, Ooni enters new territory by bringing its formula for stone-baked pizza indoors. While the results are consistently great across a range of styles, this is the company’s most expensive product to date, and I can see that being prohibitive for some – no matter how good the pizza is. A Karu 16 with the additional purchase of a gas burner is $920 or $950 (propane vs. natural gas), which would give you the convenience of a control dial with option of cooking with wood. Still not cheap, but that oven is big enough to do more than just pizza, so it’s also quite versatile. What it really comes down to is where you’ll be cooking most often – inside or out – or if you’re just fine upgrading your pizza game with accessories for your kitchen oven. And there’s absolutely no shame in doing that.OoniOoni Volt 12Ooni enters new territory by bringing its formula for stone-baked pizza indoors with its most expensive machine yet: the Volt 12.$999 at OoniOriginally published April 7, 2023 at 7:00 PM]"

Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NRG Energy in FocusBased in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 9.43%. The power company is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.34% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.18% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 96.41%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 56%. This means it paid out 56% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.54 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 73.28%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity.

Due to the extreme climate change concerns, governments are planning to move away from carbon-based fossil fuels and are looking for alternative energy sources. Renewable energy will play a huge role in this transition, and it can help achieve climate change goals.While renewable energy can play a huge role in the world climate, it only supplies about 20% of the electricity generated by the power sector through sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. The sector’s growth pace has quickened, and several companies are expanding their production capacity. If you believe in a cleaner and greener future, it is time to invest in renewable energy.While you cannot invest directly in the projects, you can invest your money in renewable energy stocks with long-term growth potential.

The largest food processor in North America, Tyson Foods is a marketer and distributor of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods. Top-line growth has remained strong, but margins have been volatile. The margin issues have been primarily in its chicken and prepared foods businesses as beef margins have benefited from ample cattle supply, global export demand and high US domestic retail prices. In the other segments, inflationary pressures have ranged from higher raw material costs to supply chain constraints and labor availability issues. Some of these factors are out of its control, but the company is making efforts to increase labor availability and shift contract terms toward variable price models that could repair margins more quickly. The business has improved over time—the company has spent years moving away from commodity processing toward a greater mix of higher margin branded products and packaging.

133,6a221767-5c66-3f93-98e1-a8df8e4aa5e3,MA,2023-04-08,Ukraine's coal miners dig deep to power a nation at war,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraines-coal-miners-dig-deep-115419541.html,1680954859,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[DNIPROPETROVSK OBLAST, Ukraine (AP) — Deep underground in southeastern Ukraine, miners work around the clock extracting coal to power the country's war effort and to provide civilians with light and heat.Coal is central to meeting Ukraine’s energy needs following the Russia's military's 6-month campaign to destroy power stations and other infrastructure, the chief engineer of a mining company in Dnipropetrovsk province said.Elevators carry the company's workers underground to the depths of the mine. From there, they operate heavy machinery that digs out the coal and moves the precious resource above ground. It is hard work, the miners said, but essential to keep the country going.“Today, the country’s energy independence is more than a priority,” said Oleksandr, the chief engineer, who, like all the coal miners interviewed, spoke on the condition of giving only his first name for security reasons.Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s nuclear, thermal and other power stations continue to disrupt electricity service as the war grinds on for a second year.Negotiations to demilitarize the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which the Kremlin's forces captured last year at the start of the full-scale invasion, are at an impasse. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy opposes any proposal that would legitimize Russian control of the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear energy facility.At full capacity, the plant can produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity. The Ukrainian operators of the plant shut down the last reactor in September, saying it was too risky to run while Russia bombarded nearby areas.Shelling has damaged the plant numerous times, raising fears of a possible nuclear meltdown. Russian missiles have also threatened the power lines needed to operate vital cooling equipment at Zaporizhzhia and Ukraine's other nuclear plants.Before the war, the Ukrainian government planned to reduce the country's reliance on coal-fired power stations, which contribute to global warming, and to increase nuclear energy and natural gas production. But when Russian attacks damaged thermal plants in the middle of winter, it was coal that helped keep Ukrainian homes warm, Oleksandr said.Story continuesThe work of the coal miners cannot fully compensate for the loss of energy from nuclear power plants, but every megawatt they had a role in generating reduced gaps.“We come and work with optimism, trying not to think about what is going on outside the mine,” a miner named Serhii said. “We work with a smile and forget about it. And when we leave, then another life begins (for us), of survival and everything else.”While many miners from the area joined the armed forces when Russian troops invaded and are now fighting at the front in eastern Ukraine, nearly 150 displaced workers from other coal-producing regions in the east joined the team in Dnipropetrovsk.A man named Yurii left the embattled Donetsk province town of Vuhledar, where he worked as a coal miner for 20 years. “The war, of course, radically changed my life,” he said. “It is now impossible to live there and the mine where I used to work.”“Life begins from scratch,” he said.British military analysts reported Saturday that they think Russia’s campaign to degrade Ukraine’s energy grid over the winter through intense missile and drone strikes “highly likely failed,” and that the invaded country’s energy situation would improve as temperatures rise.The U.K. Defense Ministry said that while the strikes have continued since October, large-scale attacks causing significant infrastructure damage are becoming rare. Ukraine’s network operators also managed to source replacement transformers and other “critical” components to keep electricity flowing, the ministry said.___Samya Kallab contributed to this story from Kyiv, Ukraine.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine]"

OPEC nations pursued the cutbacks following a momentary drop in oil prices during March's banking turmoil and fears of a recession that could hurt energy demand.Bloomberg's data shows that Russia pumped around 1.285 million tons of crude oil a day, or over 9.4 million barrels. At the same time, exports of the commodity grew considerably, up 4.13 million barrels a day in the last week of March.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

All the six Gulf Arab states--Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman--are on track to post budget surpluses, many for the first time in a decade thanks to buoyant oil prices and years of fiscal reforms.But it’s not just the Arabian oil giants that will be enjoying the good times. In its latest forecast, the World Bank has predicted that in 2023, the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will grow 3.5%, more than twice the global average growth rate of 1.7% thanks mainly to high energy prices and increased oil production. GCC growth is expected to stabilize at 3.7% this year after expanding at a blistering 6.9% clip in 2022.Diversification and Sustainability Remain KeyAlthough hydrocarbons remain the backbone of MENA’s economy, the realities of climate change as well as wild oil price swings have been forcing Gulf nations to restrategize and diversify their economies away from oil--and Saudi Arabia is leading the way, again.Although Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman recently made waves in the oil community after telling Bloomberg News that Saudi Arabia intends to pump every last drop of oil and is going to be the last man standing, Saudi Arabia has crafted one of the most ambitious clean energy blueprints: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 economic plan.In the economic plan, Saudi Arabia has set a target to develop ~60 GW of renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, which compares with an installed capacity of roughly 80 GW of power plants burning gas or oil.Story continuesSo far, Saudi Arabia has only made limited progress deploying renewables with just 520 MW of utility-scale solar in operation while 400 MW of wind power is under construction.With its sun-scorched expanses and steady Red Sea breezes, Saudi Arabia is prime real estate for renewable energy generation. Last year, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco sent shockwaves through the natural gas markets after it announced that it was kicking off the biggest shale gas development outside of the United States. Saudi Aramco said it plans to spend $110 billion over the next couple of years to develop the Jafurah gas field, which is estimated to hold 200 trillion cubic feet of gas. The state-owned company hopes to start natural gas production from Jafurah in 2024 and reach 2.2 Bcf/d of sales gas by 2036 with an associated 425 million cubic feet per day of ethane.Two years ago, Aramco announced that instead of chilling all that gas and exporting it as LNG, it will convert it into a much cleaner fuel: Blue hydrogen.Saudi Aramco has  told investors that Aramco has abandoned immediate plans to develop its LNG sector in favor of hydrogen. Nasser said that the kingdom’s immediate plan is to produce enough natural gas for domestic use to stop burning oil in its power plants and convert the remainder into hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR) with the CO2 generated captured and then stored. As the greenhouse gasses are captured, this mitigates the environmental impacts on the planet.Last year, Aramco made the world’s first blue ammonia shipment--from Saudi Arabia to Japan. Japan--a country whose mountainous terrain and extreme seismic activity render it unsuitable for the development of sustainable renewable energy--is looking for dependable suppliers of hydrogen fuel with Saudi Arabia and Australia on its shortlist.The Saudi government is also building a $5 billion green hydrogen plant that will power the planned megacity of Neom when it opens in 2025. Dubbed Helios Green Fuels, the hydrogen plant will use solar and wind energy to generate 4GW of clean energy that will be used to produce green hydrogen.But here’s the main kicker: Helios could soon produce green hydrogen that’s cheaper than oil.Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) estimates that Helios’ costs could reach $1.50 per kilogram by 2030, way cheaper than the average cost of green hydrogen at $5 per kilogram and even cheaper than gray hydrogen made from cracking natural gas. Saudi Arabia enjoys serious competitive advantage in the green hydrogen business thanks to its perpetual sunshine, wind, and vast tracts of unused land.Germany has said it needs “enormous” volumes of green hydrogen, and hopes Saudi Arabia will become a key supplier. Two years ago, Germany’s cabinet committed to invest €9B (about $10.2B) in hydrogen technology in a  bid to decarbonize the economy and cut CO2 emissions. The government has proposed to build an electrolysis capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 and another 5,000 MW by 2040 over the next decade to produce fuel hydrogen.The European economic powerhouse has realized it cannot do this alone, and will require low-cost suppliers like Saudi Arabia especially as it doubles down on its green energy commitments following a series of devastating floods in the country.UAE: Nuclear, Wind and Waste-to-EnergyBack in 2021, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) announced the commissioning of the country’s first-ever nuclear power plant--the Barakah unit 1.The 1,400-megawatt nuclear plant has become the single largest electricity generator in the UAE since reaching 100% power in early December, and is now providing ""constant, reliable and sustainable electricity around the clock.""ENEC says Barakah unit 1 is ""now leading the largest decarbonization effort of any industry in the UAE to date.""Following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia, the UAE is also laying a strong foundation for the energy transition.Masdar, the clean energy arm of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, is building renewable capacity in central Asia  after signing a deal in April 2021 to develop a solar project in Azerbaijan.Since its inception in 2006, Masdar has built a portfolio of renewable energy assets in 30 different countries, having invested about $20bn to develop 11GW of solar, wind and waste-to-energy power generation capacity.And now Masdar says it intends to apply the lessons gleaned abroad to develop clean energy capacity back at home. “Solutions we have developed in our international operations will definitely have applications here in the UAE”, says Masdar’s El-Ramahi.For instance, Masdar plans to bolster the UAE’s comparatively weak wind resources by developing domestic wind farms using the latest class three turbines that are able to harness electricity even from low wind speeds.Further, the company is also constructing a $1.1bn facility that will burn garbage to generate power in one of the world’s largest waste-to-energy plants. Once complete, the plants will incinerate almost two-thirds of the household  wastes the country generates every year.Though not typically considered a clean energy source, modern waste-to-energy plants are much cleaner as per the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). By using advanced technologies, these plants are able burn waste at extremely high temperatures thus ensuring complete combustion while missions are specially treated, leaving minimal amounts of toxic byproducts like flue ash. In fact, tests have shown that the air emitted by certain waste-to-energy chimneys can be cleaner than the air flowing in.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Is The UK Doing Enough To Achieve Its Ambitious Climate Pledges?Commercial Drones Poised To Disrupt Global Supply ChainsThe Middle East Is Investing Billions Into Desalination ProjectsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The compact, portable models have become popular for both novice and pro cooks alike, allowing them to host casual pizza parties or cater events as part of a restaurant business. While the wood- and gas-burning ovens can be fun to use for all skill levels, they have to remain outdoors, and using wood or charcoal requires more attention.After making some of the best outdoor pizza ovens, Ooni introduced its first electric model designed for indoor use in March. The Volt 12 ($999) encompasses everything from the company’s existing product line, from high-heat cooking to consistent results, and adds ease of use and baking versatility to the mix. This beast is big and expensive, but it also makes some damn good pizza.DesignOoni Volt 12 reviewThe Volt 12 looks like what I’d expect an electric pizza oven from Ooni to look like. It bears the most resemblance to the Karu 16, one of the largest models the company offers. The gray and black color scheme is on every current Ooni model, except for the all-silver multi-fuel Karu 12. Rather than a rectangle, the Volt 12 has angled corners, making it more of a flat octagon than a boring box. Ooni says the exterior is powder-coated and weather resistant so you can take it outdoors – not that you would want it to get too wet. Since this model is more of a countertop appliance than its open-flame predecessors, the Volt 12 has short, stubby legs rather than the longer, folding ones on the wood- and gas- burning units.Only three Ooni models have glass doors that allow you to watch the entire cooking process. As an electric, indoor oven, the Volt 12 is one of those. Unlike the Karu 16 and Karu 12G, this panel is gloss black instead of metal. The door has a robust black handle that remains cool to the touch, even at 850 degrees, and a row of three control dials sit beneath the glass window. The only other button is an on/off switch on the left side of the front. This turns off the power completely. When this is switched on, the oven sits in standby mode until you hit the power button on the front that actually gets the Volt 12 ready to use.On the left is the time dial with the power button above it. The center control is for temperature, which ranges from 350 to 850 degrees Fahrenheit. Lastly, the far right dial is for “balance,” allowing you to shift how much power is given to the top and bottom heating elements. In other words, you can put more emphasis on the stone for a crisper crust or more on the top for a bit more browning/char. The balance control also activates a boost feature that can be used to get the stone to return to target temp quickly between pizzas (it takes about 45 seconds). All three controls are flanked by white lights for precise level indications. During pre-heating, for example, the temperature dial starts at 350 and slowly moves around to your target, blinking along the way at the current status.The bottom heating element sits underneath the stone – a 13-inch square cooking surface that can accommodate a variety of pans in addition to 12-inch pizza. There’s also an interior light that stays on the whole time, making it very easy to see how things are progressing without having to open the door.Setup and useOoni Volt 12 reviewBefore the first use, you’ll need to season Volt 12. This requires you to run the oven at full blast (850) for 20 minutes and then allow it to cool before preheating to launch your first pizza. The cooldown takes quite a bit longer than the preheating or 20-minute burnoff, so you’ll want to do thing well before you need to actually cook. The cool down time on the Volt 12 takes a while. While the exterior will be back to room temp sooner, it takes a while for the inside to do the same since the Volt 12 is so well-insulated. This means you’ll have to wait at least an hour to safely store it or put the cover on.Ooni says the 1,600-watt Volt 12 can hit 850 degrees in 20 minutes where it can cook a pizza in 90 seconds. This makes it slightly slower to achieve max temperature than its wood- or gas-burning counterparts. The Karu 16, for example, can reach 950 degrees Fahrenheit in 15 minutes. Still, 20 minutes is remarkably quick, and in my experience, the Volt 12 actually hit 850 faster than that.The key advantage the Volt 12 has over its wood-burning siblings is convenience. Those models make great pizza with the subtle flavor of wood fire, but the flames require supervision whereas the Volt 12 is very much set it and forget it. You don’t have to worry about maintaining the fire in between stretching dough, topping pizzas and launching them into the oven. The Volt 12 also sets the balance dial based on your cooking temperature, but you can adjust it if you need to. Most outdoor Ooni ovens have an optional gas burner (propane and natural gas models), which would also remedy some of the headaches with temperature regulation.Making the pizzaOoni Volt 12 reviewAll of this sounds great on paper, but it would be for naught if the thing didn’t make good pizza. Thankfully, Ooni has translated its formula for excellent outdoor cooking to its electric oven. The Volt 12 produces comparable results to any of the company’s other models, right down to the char and leoparding on Neapolitan pies. Since the temperature dial gives you more precise control, it’s easier to achieve the desired cook on everything from New York style to thin-and-crispy. With the extra space inside, you can also make Detroit pan pizza, as well as roast and bake other items with ease. The Volt 12 did well with any type of crust I threw at it, churning out tasty pies consistently in just a few minutes.Running wide open at 850 degrees, the Volt 12 makes excellent Neapolitan-style pizza. You’ll need to make sure you have a proper dough recipe (Scott Deley’s The Ooni Pizza Project is a great guide), but assuming you're starting with a good base, the oven will do its thing well. I found that the Volt 12 is a little more forgiving with rotating the pies than the open-flame outdoor models, so you don’t need to babysit it quite as much. These pizzas were light and airy with a slight crispness to the bottom and the requisite leoparding. New York-style pizzas baked at 650 were also great, with crisp edges and bottom, with a pleasant chewiness to the crust.Ooni Volt 12 reviewThere are some downsides to the Volt 12, the big one being the price. It’s $999, and I’ll be the first to tell you that excellent pizza is achievable with your main oven and a baking stone or steel that costs a fraction as much. The second thing is it’s huge. The Volt 12 takes up the entire depth of the counter and is 20 inches wide. It also weighs just under 40 pounds. That’s not too heavy, relatively speaking, and the Volt 12 can easily be chucked in the backseat for a nearby party. Ooni did design it with built-in handles on the sides though, which makes the task of moving it slightly easier.The competitionIn the US, Ooni’s main competition for the Volt 12 is the Breville Pizzaiolo. This oven has been on the market for a few years at this point, with a design that looks more like one of the company’s toaster ovens. It’s an all-stainless steel aesthetic, with a glass door for viewing and easy-to-use controls up front. Out of the box, the Pizzaiolo runs on a variety of presets for different styles, but Breville also equipped it with a manual mode to give you full control over the top and bottom heating elements.The three strikes against this alternative are cost, a confining cooking surface and the lack of interior lighting. The Pizzaiolo is $999.95, so unless you find one on sale, you won’t save any money over the Volt 12. The stone on the Pizzaiolo is circular instead of square, so you’ll only be able to use 12-inch round pans in addition to your pizza. And lastly, there’s no light inside, so it can be a challenge to keep tabs on the cooking process. You’ll almost certainly have to open the door at some point for a closer inspection.Wrap-upWith the Volt 12, Ooni enters new territory by bringing its formula for stone-baked pizza indoors. While the results are consistently great across a range of styles, this is the company’s most expensive product to date, and I can see that being prohibitive for some – no matter how good the pizza is. A Karu 16 with the additional purchase of a gas burner is $920 or $950 (propane vs. natural gas), which would give you the convenience of a control dial with option of cooking with wood. Still not cheap, but that oven is big enough to do more than just pizza, so it’s also quite versatile. What it really comes down to is where you’ll be cooking most often – inside or out – or if you’re just fine upgrading your pizza game with accessories for your kitchen oven.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$4.9b after the stock price dropped 3.5% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At QUALCOMMIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, sold US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$132 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$123. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.QUALCOMM Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at QUALCOMM. In total, insiders sold US$1.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$166m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At QUALCOMM Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought QUALCOMM stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that QUALCOMM is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

For more Android phones, head on over to 5 Best Android Phones to Buy for 2023. Smartphones are the bedrock of modern day technology as they have proven to be one of the most, if not the most, consequential products of the past two decades. In fact, no one would have thought that the entire Internet would be in the palm of a user's hand even at the turn of the current century. Yet today we have billions of devices that have been shipped all over the world by a variety of firms to a multitude of users with different usage requirements.In the smartphone industry, there are two device categories in terms of software. One of these is iOS devices, which are made and sold by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the other is Android smartphones. iOS is available only for Apple's smartphones, since the Cupertino, California technology giant is known for keeping tight control of its gadget ecosystem due to its belief that user experience can only be maximized by designing the hardware and software together. On the other hand, Android is developed by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which allows the operating system to run on any device provided the manufacturer agrees to place the YouTube, Play Store and other applications on the gadget - to provide Google with a steady source of revenue not only through licensing its software but also by driving user engagement to its platform.In terms of market size, Android is vastly bigger simply due to the fact that countless manufacturers are able to use the software on their devices. According to Google, there were a whopping 3 billion+ active Android devices in the world as of May 2022, out of which one billion were added in the previous year alone. According to Apple, there were a little over 2 billion active Apple devices as of December 2022, with the tally also counting other gadgets such as Macs and Apple Watches.Story continuesTaking a broader look at both the markets in the smartphone world, a recent research report from Counterpoint Intelligence outlines that global smartphone sales dropped by 14% annually as of last year's December quarter. However, iOS weathered this storm better, as Apple's devices dropped by 12% annually while the Android gadgets saw sales slow down by 16% annually. This lackluster performance in the smartphone market came at a time when both developed and developing economies are facing a historic inflationary storm fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and generous fiscal largesse in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.According to Counterpoint, Apple's overall smartphone market share touched a record high in Q4 2022, as it was aided by the fact that the firm only sells premium smartphones. Users that buy such devices generally have stronger purchasing power than the wider population, and their resilience enabled Apple to maintain its bearing in a turbulent economy. Despite this, Android was still the market leader as it commanded a strong 76% of the total market, with iOS coming in at second place by holding a 22% market share.In terms of monetary value, the global smartphone market is one of the most valuable industries in the world. According to a research report from Verified Market Research, the global smartphone market was worth $823 billion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% between 2023 to 2023 and sit at an estimated $2 trillion by the end of the forecast period. If you think that's high, then keep in mind that Apple's smartphone sales for only the three months that ended in December 2022 were worth $66 billion, and the firm had sold $205 billion worth of iPhones during its fiscal year that ended in September 2022. By making some assumptions of our own, we can estimate that the 22% market share quoted from Counterpoint above would value the smartphone market at $903 billion last year. Of course, this back of the envelope estimate has the caveat of assuming that all iOS gadgets in operation are the newer iPhones which command a premium price as opposed to older devices which are quite cheap.Shifting gears to look at the smartphone market in terms of units shipped, a report from Infiniti Research Limited believes that the smartphone market will add 226 million units between 2022 and 2027 to mark a 3.44% CAGR. On the topic of units, the industry is now recovering from the supply chain shocks of the coronavirus pandemic, with Apple's chief executive officer Mr.  Tim Cook sharing during the firm's recent earnings call  that:On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic.With this backdrop, let's take a look at some great Android smartphones to buy for 2023.21 Best Android phones to buy for 2023Leszek Kobusinski/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list we consulted eleven different sources and rankings, including New York Times, Expert Reviews, Tech Advisor, PC Mag, Wired and CNET.

Neuchips did not compete in the categories described in the story and has been removed, and Qualcomm's results and rankings have been corrected in paragraphs 6-8.)By Stephen NellisApril 5 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chips from Qualcomm Inc beat Nvidia Corp in two out of three measures of power efficiency in a new set of test data published on Wednesday.Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models with huge amounts of data. But after those AI models are trained, they are put to wider use in what is called ""inference"" by doing tasks like generating text responses to prompts and deciding whether an image contains a cat.Analysts believe that the market for data center inference chips will grow quickly as businesses put AI technologies into their products, but companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google are already exploring how to keep the lid on the extra costs that doing so will add.One of those major costs is electricity, and Qualcomm has used its history designing chips for battery-powered devices such as smartphones to create a chip called the Cloud AI 100 that aims for parsimonious power consumption.In testing data published on Wednesday by MLCommons, an engineering consortium that maintains testing benchmarks widely used in the AI chip industry, Qualcomm's AI 100 beat Nvidia's flagship H100 chip at classifying images, based on how many data center server queries each chip can carry out per watt.Qualcomm's chips hit 227.4 server queries per watt versus 108.4 queries per watt for Nvidia.Qualcomm also beat Nvidia at object detection with a score of 3.8 queries per watt versus Nvidia's 2.4 queries per watt. Object detection can be used in applications like analyzing footage from retail stores to see where shoppers go most often.Nvidia, however, took the top spot in both absolute performance terms and power efficiency terms in a test of natural language processing, which is the AI technology most widely used in systems like chatbots. Nvidia hit 10.8 queries per watt, while Qualcomm ranked second at 8.9 queries per watt. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Simao)]"

Ultimately, the contract is potentially worth around $70 billion - over decades - depending on how many the Army and U.S. allies order, the Army has said.In the FLARAA competition was Bell's V-280 ""Valor,"" a tiltrotor aircraft that has reached speeds in excess of 340 mph (547 kph) according to the Army. It beat out the entrant from Lockheed's Sikorsky unit and Boeing Co's SB-1 ""Defiant"" which has two coaxial rotors and a single pusher propeller and has reached speeds of 265 mph (426 kph), according to the Army.“We remain confident the Lockheed Martin Sikorsky and Boeing team submitted the most capable, affordable and lowest-risk Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft solution.

LMT recently clinched a modification contract involving F-35 fighter jets. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $18.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by January 2026. The latest modification allows Lockheed to provide depot tooling and test equipment for establishing the initial depot repair of radio frequency support electronics and multi-function antenna components for the F-35 aircraft.Work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs, boost demand significantly.This, in turn, results in a solid contract flow from Pentagon and other U.S. allies for production and other associated support for modernizing and upgradation of the F-35 jets. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Impressively, the F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022. Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to reap the benefits of the abovementioned market’s expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to gain from the global military aircraft market’s growth opportunities.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft. From fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare, it has been providing manned solutions to customers worldwide. The company has built some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.Its Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems. The Mission Systems segment offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control, LONGBOW Fire Control Radar and Scalable Agile Beam Radar.Airbus Group’s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived.The company has been providing its aircraft customers with an extended portfolio of services for more than 40 years, ranging from the training of flight and ground staff to live firing exercises anywhere around the world.Textron’s military aircraft includes the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft, and the T-1A jet trainer.Its subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services for commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.Price MovementShares of Lockheed have gained 7.8% in the past 12 months against the industry’s 7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Hence, wagering on buying the best space stocks to buy presents an exhilarating prospect for the adventurous investor. From established defense plays to up-and-coming startups, the diverse range of players in the space industry offers tremendous long-term opportunities for investors.Morgan Stanley predicts the global space sector could skyrocket to a staggering $1 trillion value by 2040. On top of that, there is substantial pent-up demand for space travel already, as Cowen analysts reported that 39% of individuals with a $5 million net worth have expressed interest in shelling out a minimum of $250,000 for an outer-space experience.That said, we’ll take you on a thrilling journey through three space stocks holding massive promise for aggressive investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSpace Stocks to Buy: Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comInvesting in a secondary play might be a more apt approach when wagering on a risky sector such as space. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is arguably one of the best secondary plays in the space sector, with a strong presence in the aerospace and defense segments. The defense contractor boasts a stable business, which has handsomely rewarded shareholders through regular dividend payouts and share price appreciation.The firm’s space segment, which includes space transportation, defense systems, and satellites, has played a key role in NASA’s Lucy mission to Jupiter and the 2024 Orion mission to the moon. Additionally, it partnered with space services provider NanoRacks to develop Starlab, the first-ever free-flying commercial space station. With Starlab expected to achieve initial operational capability by 2027, Lockheed Martin is well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning space industry.Story continues2022 was a relatively tough year for the business as it faced multiple supply chain issues negatively impacting its top and bottom-line performances. However, In 2024, Lockheed Martin could potentially return to mid-single-digit growth.Nevertheless, its dividend profile remains as strong as ever, with 20 consecutive years of growth and a 2.5% forward yield.ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF (ARKX)A SpaceX spacecraft docking at the International Space Station.Source: ShutterstockOne of the best ways to board the cosmic journey of investing in the space sector and minimize risk is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Once a red-hot stock, SPCE’s price shot to the moon following its management’s lofty claims and targets, which they failed to achieve. Consequently, amidst several delays and other setbacks, its stock is down over 90% from its highs achieved in February 2021.However, this year SPCE stock has been ticking upward following an announcement that upgrades to its VMS Eve mothership were complete in anticipation of commercial testing to begin in the second quarter. Commercial testing is expected to remain on track beginning in the second half of 2023.Though there’s a lot to dislike about SPCE stock, the long-term opportunity in space tourism cannot be denied. According to Vantage Market Research, the space tourism market could grow at a CAGR of 36.4% between 2021 to 2028.

This year's theme is Health for All. At Medtronic, we strive for better health access for our world and believe healthcare technology can connect, enhance, and extend lives.Donor-supported healthcare programs in low- and middle-income countries have historically been focused on specific diseases like malaria or maternal health, but in designing the global health system of the future, Medtronic LABS is thinking bigger than individual diseases.The independent Medtronic-funded nonprofit is expanding to address the full spectrum of community health needs - hypertension, diabetes, mental health, malaria, TB, HIV, maternal health, and more.""With over 5 billion people in these communities across the world lacking access to healthcare, we need health systems to look beyond addressing specific conditions and consider patients' broader health needs,"" said Anne Stake, chief strategy and product officer at Medtronic LABS. ""It's time to move away from the historical ‘verticalization' of health systems.""LABS, which accelerates healthcare access for underserved communities around the world through technology, has been primarily focused on hypertension and diabetes since launching in 2013.While disease-specific programs, which Stake describes as verticals, have been successful in addressing individual diseases, they often overlook the connections between different health conditions and the overall needs of patients.""We realized that LABS' strength in data-driven population health adds value to a range of different conditions,"" she said. ""It's a pivot away from just looking at a single condition to transforming community healthcare delivery.""And what does that transformation look like? For LABS, it's more data driven and responsive to patient needs.Story continuesDesigned for growthLABS has found its success in a sustainable healthcare model that pairs hyper-local services with cutting-edge technology - and that won't change as it continues to grow.The organization forges strong partnerships in the public and private sectors, all while connecting patients to care through a network of community health workers, who play a critical role in bridging the gap between disease verticals.Health systems are equipped with LABS' technology platform, SPICE, designed to drive better health outcomes for patients. SPICE is ushering in a new era of data-driven community healthcare delivery. For instance, one feature alerts clinicians if a community health worker sees patients with worsening symptoms or alarming test results in the field.The dashboard tracks health outcomes and population health indicators in real time - which can support policy and planning for health system leaders.SPICE - and LABS overall - was built for this type of growth.""We built SPICE for integrated care, with the ability to turn on and off conditions,"" said Kelly Shelden, head of technology at LABS, ""Our strategy from the beginning is to be the community health platform standard.""Since its launch, LABS has reached more than 1 million patients with hypertension and diabetes, and trained over 6,500 health workers in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ghana, Sierra Leone, the United States, and India.That impact is expected to grow, according Megha Kumar, head of global partnerships at LABS.""With new partnerships at every level of the global health system we believe that our move into broader community healthcare delivery will amplify our impact 10 times over the next couple of years,"" she said.Medtronic, Friday, April 7, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/748111/Medtronic-LABS-Broader-Scope-Expands-Access]"

The Medtronic Foundation is committed to supporting communities where Medtronic employees live and give by providing resources that support volunteerism and giving across the globe.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 6, 2023 / When Marcus Reid took a job developing talent at Medtronic, he didn't know that in a few years he'd be using his skills to teach young people on probation to see their strengths - and their potential.The 30-year Medtronic employee credits his co-workers with helping him see people as people, whether they are selling medical devices or serving time. That, he said, is why he was ready for what happened next, at a fateful dinner with an old friend.Reid's friend, a probation officer, shared his concerns that some of his young probationers were destined for a cruel and difficult life in the state penitentiary if they didn't learn to change their ways.As a CliftonStrengths coach, Reid had one question: ""Do you have something that can tell them what they do right instead of what they do wrong, something that helps them believe in themselves""? The answer was no.If he could teach salespeople to tap into their potential, he wondered why not young people who are on probation?That question launched a grass roots initiative that takes Reid on a six-hour drive to Gainesville, Texas to teach people on probation how to discover − and apply − their strengths.It's been so successful the District Attorney's office has asked him to train his staff so they can help reinforce the CliftonStrengths to probationers.""Now, many are developing a positive sense of self-esteem and starting to believe in their own potential,"" Reid said.Connecting the dots for the greater goodReid's grassroots effort has a name: Skills-based volunteering, which connects your unique skills and passions with the needs in your community.Story continuesAnd it's a way to think outside of the box when it comes to finding - or creating - volunteer opportunities.""Utilizing your professional skills in this way not only creates lasting, tangible impact for the organization you partner with, but it's also an opportunity to expand your resume and your network,"" said Mandy Iverson, employee experience manager for the Medtronic Foundation.We encourage employees like Reid to find ways to make a difference in their communities through a volunteer and giving hub and then maximize their impact through the Medtronic Foundation Volunteer Grant and Matched Giving programs.And if employees find opportunities organically like Reid, their contributions still matter because tracking skills-based volunteering provides valuable insights that help the Medtronic Foundation team fine additional opportunities that fit employees' passions.By connecting the dots between his professional experience and the community, Reid is making a difference for young men like James.*The 20-year-old who grew up with an incarcerated father. His mom died, and he found himself living with his grandma when the pandemic hit.

Now he's looking into taking business classes at the local community college.""No one's ever told me what I'm doing right,"" Reid recalled him saying.He wonders what would have happened if James saw his potential sooner, so he's looking into bringing the workshop to kids who are still in high school − before they end up in the system.He also wants to expand the current program to include career assessment tools to take what his students are learning a step further.""They're going to have a clear idea of the direction they can go, so they're not just taking a chance,"" he said.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past six months (+23.4% vs. +22.4%). The company’s robust surprise trend, which continued in fiscal Q2 2023, bodes well. Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter.The company’s organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that have hurt margins. Also, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)PepsiCo’s shares have gained +9.3% over the past year against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +11.2%.

The company benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses.It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It outlined its view for 2023. However, PepsiCo witnessed margin pressures in the fourth quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (-28.1% vs. -17.5%). The company’s over-dependence on trading revenues for fee income is concerning. The volatile nature of the capital markets will adversely impact non-interest income performance.A tough operating backdrop will lead to increase in provisions, with we projecting a substantial jump in the metric this year. However, higher interest rates and decent loan demand are expected to keep aiding the company’s net interest income (NII).Likewise, the company’s net interest yield will continue expanding in the near-term.

With 84% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Medtronic, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Medtronic already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Medtronic, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 9.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Medtronic plc in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$97m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Medtronic. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Let's see which one of these have actually popped since then, but before that, let's look at how Cramer feels about the market situation right now.The Way to ""Whip Inflation Now"", According to CramerOn March 28, Jim Cramer spoke about the current inflation situation and the Fed. Jim Cramer noted that that while the Fed wants to tame inflation, it does not want to go as far as causing further bank failures, and so the Fed decided to go with a quarter-point rate hike instead of a half-point rate hike due to the recent banking crisis. Jim Cramer thinks that the Fed needs to stop raising interest rates further, however, it cannot unless ""wage inflation cools dramatically"". According to Cramer, there are two ways that the Fed can ""whip inflation now"". One way is that the Fed keeps raising interest rates, causing wage stagnation and hurting the housing and automotive sectors along with the overall economy. The other riskier way to get wage inflation in control is to create ""financial panic"". Here are some comments from Jim Cramer:""I think this bank crisis, or jam, if left to its own devices is equal to about 100 basis points of tightening, if it continues like this. A big bank failure is incredibly deflationary, it's perhaps the most deflationary thing that could happen to an entire economy. It's more shocking than endless rate hikes, but it gets the darn process over with, even with collateral damage that tends to be a lot worse. No I don't want it to be this way, believe me. This is a bad way to beat inflation, but it will definitely do the job.""Story continuesCramer thinks that the risk of further banking failures is not over yet. He also pointed out that as long as small banks continue to suffer from contagion risks, the Fed will need to continue raising interest rates. Cramer said that the only way the Fed's tightening cycle will end is if and when a large bank fails.As of March 30, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) has gained 10.12% over the past 6 months.

(NYSE:GNRC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), is a manufacturer of power generation equipment with a leading position in home standby generators. Generac also offers consumers a home energy management system that harnesses and stores power from the sun to be used for backup during utility power outages. Severe weather events that strained already-overburdened power grids in California, Texas, and other key markets have created a significant opportunity for home power generation equipment manufacturers. Moreover, with the future potential to aggregate these distributed energy resources through the company’s grid services business, homeowners have the potential to monetize these assets. The stock declined during the quarter as the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance due largely to labor shortages in Generac’s dealer network which resulted in a slowdown in installations and implementations. As a consequence, dealers have reduced their on-site inventory. During the period, we exited our position in the company.”13.

From a qualitative perspective, we were concerned about the company’s aggressive international expansion which increases currency risk, but, more importantly, signals a lack of investable growth in the U.S. market now that 5G wireless investments are slowing. We were also becoming increasingly worried about the impact that rising interest rates will have on SBA’s over-levered balance sheet.”11. Crown Castle International Corp.

The company is seeing some pressure from non-renewals as a result of a merger between two major telecommunications companies.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1006-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -19.09%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) was among Cramer's top bank stock picks.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”9. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 616-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -17.48%Cramer was bullish on American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) and mentioned it among his top telecom stocks that were ""about to pop"".

REITs are generally perceived to be interest rate sensitive, which negatively impacted American Tower’s recent stock performance. However, we remain confident in the company’s highly durable and predictable business model, which is supported by long-term customer contracts and insatiable wireless data growth.”8. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 236-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -16.49%One of Cramer's favorite REITs in October was Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA).

(NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”While Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

(NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230405005809/en/LEAP-003: Merck and Eisai are discontinuing the Phase 3 LEAP-003 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This decision is based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which reviewed data from a planned interim analysis and determined KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival (OS), one of the study’s dual primary endpoints, versus KEYTRUDA alone. Merck and Eisai are informing study investigators of the decision and advising them to reach out to patients in the study regarding treatment. At an earlier interim analysis, the trial’s other dual primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), showed a statistically significant improvement in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm versus the KEYTRUDA plus placebo arm.LEAP-017: The Phase 3 LEAP-017 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA did not meet its primary endpoint of OS for the treatment of patients with unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) who experienced disease progression on, or became intolerant to, prior therapy. In the final pre-specified analysis of OS, a trend toward improvement was observed with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus regorafenib or TAS-102 (trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride); however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. A trend toward improvement was also observed in key secondary endpoints of PFS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus regorafenib or TAS-102; however, per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan these results were not tested for statistical significance.Story continuesIn both the LEAP-003 and LEAP-017 trials, the safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was consistent with previously reported data on the combination. A full evaluation of the data from these studies, including pre-planned key subgroup analyses, is ongoing. The companies will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community.""We are grateful to all the investigators, patients and their families for their participation in these studies, and we will continue to evaluate KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA across different types of cancer where additional treatment options are needed. We remain fully committed to building on existing treatments as part of our efforts to help as many appropriate patients with cancer as we can,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories.""With the LEAP-003 and LEAP-017 trials, we set out to help improve outcomes for patients with two difficult-to-treat advanced cancers, melanoma and colorectal cancer,"" said Corina Dutcus, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Oncology at Eisai Inc. ""While these results are different from our initial expectation, insights from both studies will help contribute to our understanding of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA. We remain confident in LENVIMA as a pillar of Eisai’s oncology portfolio and will continue to evaluate its potential in ongoing trials within the LEAP program.""KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX® for advanced RCC in the EU. Results from the LEAP-003 and LEAP-017 trials do not affect the current approved indications for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in multiple tumor types, including but not limited to endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer, across more than 10 clinical trials.About LEAP-003LEAP-003 is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03820986) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus KEYTRUDA alone for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The dual primary endpoints are OS and PFS, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Key secondary endpoints include ORR and DOR, both as assessed by RECIST v1.1, and safety. The study enrolled 674 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily); orKEYTRUDA (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus placebo via oral capsule daily.KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years) or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met.About melanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, pigment producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed. Although melanoma accounts for only 1% of skin cancers, it accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and approximately 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2023. The five-year survival rates from 2012-2018 are estimated to be 71% for regional disease and 32% for distant disease.About LEAP-017LEAP-017 is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04776148) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus regorafenib or TAS-102 for patients with unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer that is pMMR or not MSI-H who have received and progressed on or after, or became intolerant to, prior treatment. Patients must have been previously treated for colorectal cancer and have shown disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 on or after, or could not tolerate, standard treatment. The standard treatment must include all of the following agents, if approved and locally available in the country where the participant is randomized:Fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin;With or without an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab);With anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab) for RAS (KRAS/NRAS) wild-type (WT) participants; andBRAF inhibitor (in combination with cetuximab +/- binimetinib) for BRAF V600E mutated metastatic colon cancer.The primary endpoint is OS and key secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DOR, according to RECIST v1.1 per blinded independent central review (BICR). The study enrolled 480 patients randomized 1:1 to receive:KEYTRUDA (400 mg IV on Day 1 of each six-week cycle) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily); orRegorafenib (160 mg given orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of each four-week cycle; or TAS-102 (35mg/m2 given orally twice daily on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each four-week cycle).KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 18 cycles (approximately two years), or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met.About colorectal cancerColorectal cancer can be referred to as colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It is estimated there were more than 1,880,000 new cases of colorectal cancer globally in 2020. In the United States, it is estimated there will be approximately 107,000 new cases of colon cancer and approximately 46,000 new cases of rectal cancer, resulting in more than 52,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2023. The five-year relative survival rates in the U.S. for metastatic colon cancer and rectal cancer (stage IV) are estimated to be 13% and 17%, respectively.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal CancerKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) as determined by an FDA-approved test.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L.

In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgment of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

The first detailed results of the trial will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Orlando, FL, from April 14-19.""Prime scheme designation for mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA highlights the potential promise of individualized cancer treatments in a population with limited alternatives,"" said Stephen Hoge, M.D., Moderna's President. ""There is a high unmet need for therapies in melanoma, as it can be a life-threatening condition where available therapies may not be sufficiently effective in a significant proportion of patients.""""This milestone underscores the potential for personalized approaches to help improve outcomes for people living with certain types of melanoma,"" said Dr. Eric H. Rubin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to working with the EMA, in collaboration with Moderna, to advance our clinical development program for mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA.""PRIME is a regulatory mechanism run by the EMA that provides support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early and proactive support to help optimize the generation of robust data on a medicine's benefits and risks and speed up the development and evaluation of medicines applications, with the objective of helping patients benefit as early as possible from therapies that may significantly improve their quality of life.Story continuesAs previously announced, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for mRNA-4157/V940 in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage III/IV high-risk melanoma following complete resection. The companies continue to discuss the results of the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 trial with regulatory authorities and plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in 2023 and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer.About mRNA-4157/V940mRNA-4157/V940 is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based personalized cancer vaccine consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and mRNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.Personalized cancer vaccines are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate a tailored antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157/V940 is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157/V940 with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized to receive mRNA-4157/V940 (nine total doses of mRNA-4157) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival and safety.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases.About MelanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. It is estimated that skin melanoma accounted for 4% of all new cancer diagnoses in EU-27 countries in 2020 (all cancers, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) and for 1.3% of all deaths due to cancer. This made it the sixth most frequently occurring cancer (after breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, and bladder cancers) and one of the 20 most frequent causes of cancer death.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.SMelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular:Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal:Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

(The) (WMB). This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This pipeline operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.93%.For the last reported quarter, Williams Companies, Inc. (The) came out with earnings of $0.53 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47 per share, representing a surprise of 12.77%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.48 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.09%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Williams Companies, Inc. (The) lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.25%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Williams Companies, Inc. (The) (WMB) earns a Zacks Rank #3 25 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.51 a share.WMB has an Earnings ESP figure of 6.25%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.51 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48.WMB is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. First Solar (FSLR) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.First Solar is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 27, 2023. FSLR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.46 a share 21 days from its next earnings release.For First Solar, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 is 53.47%.WMB and FSLR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

No new airplane orders were announced during the visit.Airbus is marketing a freighter version of its A350 jet and is keen to sell more wide-body passenger jets to China. It opened an A350 completion centre there in 2021.While domestic traffic has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels after extended COVID-19 lockdowns, international traffic is at about 30% of 2019 levels.Rival Boeing had been expected to secure a large order for its wide-body 787 before a chill in Sino-U.S. relations left the planemaker partially frozen out of China.With international demand still behind the rebound in domestic flying, analysts have said airlines have time to wait for an eventual detente and ensure maximum competition before making major long-haul fleet choices.The statement also said European and Chinese regulators would accelerate certification involving the Airbus H175 helicopter, Dassault Aviation 8X business jet and Harbin Y12F turboprop.The H175 was co-developed by Airbus Helicopters and Chinese aerospace conglomerate AVIC and is often used for ambulance or police service. The Chinese version is certified in the country but the French-produced one has yet to win the Chinese safety approval needed before it can be exported to China.Airbus Helicopters, the world's largest civil helicopter maker, separately announced a major deal for its new multi-mission H160 with the sale of 50 units to Chinese lessor GDAT.The deal was signed during Macron's visit and is the biggest since the helicopter, which is designed for missions like oil and gas or servicing wind farms, was launched in 2015.

The move comes after reports of water from lavatories getting under the cabin floor and into electronic equipment bays.The FAA said the leaks could damage critical equipment and lead to a “loss of continued safe flight and landing.”The agency said one airline found wet carpet in the cockpit of a plane and, when it inspected its entire fleet of 787s, found “multiple” planes with leaking faucets. The FAA did not identify the airline.Boeing advised airlines in November about the issue, which has been traced to an O-ring seal and described as a slow leak — about 8 ounces of water per hour. However, Boeing said the issue was limited to certain 787s while the FAA order would cover all of them.The FAA described the extra inspections as a temporary measure while the manufacturer redesigns the faucet modules.A Boeing spokesman said the redesign is complete and the company is working with its supplier and customers to determine when planes can be retrofitted with new parts.Japanese aircraft parts maker Jamco says on its website that it is the exclusive provider of lavatories for all two-aisle Boeing jets such as the 787. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.There will be a 45-day period for comments before the FAA proposal can become a final order.The inspections would apply to 140 planes in U.S. fleets. Boeing calls the 787 the Dreamliner. It is a bigger plane than the 737 Max and is used extensively on long flights including international ones.Dreamliner deliveries have been halted for several stretches during the past two years because of FAA concern over production flaws, although deliveries recently resumed after the latest stoppage.]"

Airbus last year clawed back two deliveries to reflect Western sanctions on Russia.Airbus delivered 11 wide-body jets including 5 A350s in the first quarter of 2023, 10 small A220 jets and 106 of its best-selling A320neo-family aircraft, the sources said.Airbus declined comment ahead of a release due on April 11, when rival Boeing is also scheduled to report deliveries.After starting the year with a one-third drop in deliveries in January, Airbus reduced the cumulative year-on-year deficit to 11% in March from 16% the month before.But hopes of achieving deliveries in the high 130s in the first quarter were hit by continuing industrial and supply chain problems that have most recently spread to premium wide-body cabins, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The quarterly drop was led by the long-haul A350, down to 5 aircraft from an unadjusted total of 16 a year earlier.MID-YEAR DEADLINEDeliveries set the tone for profits and cashflow since airlines and lessors pay most of the price on delivery.Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury moved to bolster medium-term output targets and deepen access to a key market by announcing a new assembly line in China on Thursday.The company has also strengthened a ""watchtower"" system aimed at monitoring lower tiers of the supply chain.But the shortfall in the first quarter keeps Airbus under pressure to speed deliveries in the current quarter, or at least regain enough visibility to either confirm or review an annual goal of 720 deliveries by mid-year.Story continuesThe company was forced to lower its delivery target last year before eventually abandoning it as supply woes swamped its forecasts.Sources say Faury, who has called 2023 make-or-break after last year's downgrades, is determined to avoid flying blind into the second half, meaning the half-year performance may be decisive for delivery goals and operational planning.Even so, Airbus and Boeing are both ramping up output to meet rising global demand. Faury said in China on Thursday that the new line there would leave valuable new ""surge"" capacity. (Reporting by Tim Hepher; editing by Jason Neely, Robert Birsel, Kirsten Donovan)]"

182,ee4d3e31-becd-3067-9eab-13853761096e,MAA,2023-04-08,14 Stocks “About To Pop” According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-stocks-pop-according-jim-150048076.html,1680879648,STORY,"['SPY', 'GNRC', 'AMT', 'SWK', 'CCI', 'DPUKY', 'SBAC', 'KEY', 'MAA', 'NOW']","[In this article we will discuss the 14 stocks Jim Cramer recommended back in October 2022, and how they have fared since then. If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect.2022 was one of the worst years for the stock market due to high inflation and rising interest rates. In October 2022, Mad Money's Jim Cramer spotted 14 potential buying opportunities among 59 stocks that made new lows. Cramer said at the time that these 14 stocks were ""about to pop"". Let's see which one of these have actually popped since then, but before that, let's look at how Cramer feels about the market situation right now.The Way to ""Whip Inflation Now"", According to CramerOn March 28, Jim Cramer spoke about the current inflation situation and the Fed. Jim Cramer noted that that while the Fed wants to tame inflation, it does not want to go as far as causing further bank failures, and so the Fed decided to go with a quarter-point rate hike instead of a half-point rate hike due to the recent banking crisis. Jim Cramer thinks that the Fed needs to stop raising interest rates further, however, it cannot unless ""wage inflation cools dramatically"". According to Cramer, there are two ways that the Fed can ""whip inflation now"". One way is that the Fed keeps raising interest rates, causing wage stagnation and hurting the housing and automotive sectors along with the overall economy. The other riskier way to get wage inflation in control is to create ""financial panic"". Here are some comments from Jim Cramer:""I think this bank crisis, or jam, if left to its own devices is equal to about 100 basis points of tightening, if it continues like this. A big bank failure is incredibly deflationary, it's perhaps the most deflationary thing that could happen to an entire economy. It's more shocking than endless rate hikes, but it gets the darn process over with, even with collateral damage that tends to be a lot worse. No I don't want it to be this way, believe me. This is a bad way to beat inflation, but it will definitely do the job.""Story continuesCramer thinks that the risk of further banking failures is not over yet. He also pointed out that as long as small banks continue to suffer from contagion risks, the Fed will need to continue raising interest rates. Cramer said that the only way the Fed's tightening cycle will end is if and when a large bank fails.As of March 30, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) has gained 10.12% over the past 6 months. Some of Cramer's ""about to pop"" stocks that have outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) include ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Let's now look at how all of Cramer's picks from October 2022 have performed relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past 6 months.14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In RetrospectOur MethodologyWe got Cramer's stocks from his October 2022 list of 14 stocks that were ""about to pop"" according to him. We calculated the 6-month returns of each of these stocks, as of March 30, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). The idea was to gauge the performance of Cramer's stock picks. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their 6-month returns, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect14. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 316-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -47.00%One of Jim Cramer's top picks from October 2022 was Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). The company is an American manufacturer of backup power generation facilities Cramer said that the he liked how low the stock was, enough to add it to his charitable trust. Shares of Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) have lost 47% over the past 6 months, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), as of March 30.At the end of Q4 2022, 31 hedge funds were bullish on Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) and held stakes worth $588.2 million in the company. Of those, Ariel Investments was the top investor in the company and held a stake worth $132 million.Meridian Funds made the following comment about Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), is a manufacturer of power generation equipment with a leading position in home standby generators. Generac also offers consumers a home energy management system that harnesses and stores power from the sun to be used for backup during utility power outages. Severe weather events that strained already-overburdened power grids in California, Texas, and other key markets have created a significant opportunity for home power generation equipment manufacturers. Moreover, with the future potential to aggregate these distributed energy resources through the company’s grid services business, homeowners have the potential to monetize these assets. The stock declined during the quarter as the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance due largely to labor shortages in Generac’s dealer network which resulted in a slowdown in installations and implementations. As a consequence, dealers have reduced their on-site inventory. During the period, we exited our position in the company.”13. KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 336-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -34.95%KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) was another one of Jim Cramer's stocks that were ""about to pop"". He recommended the stock amid high interest rates, pointing out that its dividend yield is attractive. As of March 30, the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 6.47% and is trading at a PE multiple of 6x.KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) has underperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 34.95% over the past 6 months, as of March 30.KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) was held by 33 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022.

SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 426-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -21.10%SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) was one of Cramer's top picks from the telecommunications industry.

SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) has underperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 21.10% over the past 6 months, as of March 30.At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 42 hedge funds were long SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) and held positions worth $1.02 billion in the company. Of those, Diamond Hill Capital was the leading stockholder in the company and disclosed a stake worth $165.9 million.Renaissance Investment Management made the following comment about SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our position in SBA Communications Corporation(NASDAQ:SBAC) following a deterioration in fundamental factors. From a qualitative perspective, we were concerned about the company’s aggressive international expansion which increases currency risk, but, more importantly, signals a lack of investable growth in the U.S. market now that 5G wireless investments are slowing. We were also becoming increasingly worried about the impact that rising interest rates will have on SBA’s over-levered balance sheet.”11. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 516-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -20.40%Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) was one of Cramer's telecom stocks that were ""about to pop"". He mentioned it along his other telecom picks and noted that the company's long-term growth prospects are promising. As of March 30, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) has lost 20.40% over the past 6 months, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).51 hedge funds disclosed having stakes in Crown Castle International Corp.

The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.As of December 31, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest shareholder in Crown Castle International Corp.

(NYSE:CCI) underperformed due to higher interest rates and a slightly less constructive outlook for 2023. The company is seeing some pressure from non-renewals as a result of a merger between two major telecommunications companies.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1006-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -19.09%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) was among Cramer's top bank stock picks. He liked the major bank due to its ""massive deposit base"" and noted that it has ""tiny"" loan losses and ""gigantic"" credit balances.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”9. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 616-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -17.48%Cramer was bullish on American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) and mentioned it among his top telecom stocks that were ""about to pop"".

The Strategy benefited from its underweight in the real estate sector with American Tower Corporation(NYSE:AMT) as its only holding. REITs are generally perceived to be interest rate sensitive, which negatively impacted American Tower’s recent stock performance. However, we remain confident in the company’s highly durable and predictable business model, which is supported by long-term customer contracts and insatiable wireless data growth.”8. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 236-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -16.49%One of Cramer's favorite REITs in October was Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA). He noted that the company's operations are in areas where ""housing is in short supply"" and so it would be ""stupid"" to sell the stock. Cramer thought Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) was ""about to pop"" but over the past 6 months, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) has underperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 16.49%, as of March 30.At the end of Q4 2022, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) was spotted on 23 investors' portfolios that disclosed stakes worth $323 million in the company.

(NYSE:MAA) Communities is a REIT that owns, develops, acquires, and operates multi-family apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of the U.S. In recent quarters, its results have benefited from significant lease rate increases, but investors have begun to anticipate a deceleration as monetary policy takes aim at inflation.”7. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 256-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -11.73%One of Cramer's top stock picks from October was Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK).

(NYSE:SWK) has lost 11.73% over the past 6 months, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).25 hedge funds held stakes in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”While Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) has underperformed over the past 2 quarters, Cramer's picks that have outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past 6 months include ServiceNow, Inc.

As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

196,e2cb5170-5d0e-3d24-a4c6-4c9811abf29c,WFC,2023-04-08,Wells Fargo (WFC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-earnings-expected-140002818.html,1680876002,STORY,['WFC'],"[The market expects Wells Fargo (WFC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.8%.Revenues are expected to be $20.33 billion, up 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Wells Fargo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +6.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wells Fargo appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani here to break it down for us. Hi there, Anj. What are we learning?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Dave. So we know that Pfizer's RSV vaccine against-- protecting against RSV for infants, especially when it's given through pregnant mothers, has proven 82% effective in a phase III trial. That's a really good number. It kind of is on par with what we saw with GSK, which is another player in the field, but we'll get to that in a second. So phase III trial, the trial was conducted in 18 countries with pregnant women who were between 24 and 36 weeks pregnant. And this is for a single shot, so that's really good news as well.Pfizer also has on-- developing a vaccine for older adults. And that's another area where we've already seen the FDA advisory committee come in on that. So let's look at the vaccine race here for RSV because that's where the new vaccine race is. You've got GSK and Pfizer both really in the lead here when it comes to being in touch with the FDA and having advisory committees already for their older adult vaccine. We also know that Pfizer now has the infant one. Also Moderna, in the race, got a breakthrough designation from the FDA. So those three are kind of the ones that are ahead of the game there.And then we've got Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax, which, in various phases, dropped out or have paused their trials. So that's sort of where we are-- three leaders in the race right now. Important to note that RSV, while it has been around for a while, there is no vaccine for it just yet, either for infants or older adults. And it is particularly important for those individuals because it's kind of deadly for that age group. Most kids do get RSV by the time they're two years old, but we did see quite a harsh season last season, especially with the tripledemic. So that's where a lot of focus is on this infectious disease right now.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Anj, the FDA right now saying some Americans may be able to get their next updated booster soon, something that they want to get out there so those booster shots are not wasted. What can you tell us about that?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So this is the second booster of the Omicron specific vaccine for COVID-19, and that's going to be largely for the most vulnerable population. So you're thinking older adults, immunocompromised, and that is something that the CDC is going to likely allow, but not recommend. So that falls in line with what we've seen with the administration sort of pulling back from the emergency situation.And it's important to note that we're currently dealing with a new variant, sort of in that same family, though, the XVB 116. That's the one that the World Health Organization is currently focused on. There have been cases reported in 18 states here in the US, but it is largely doing a number, really, on Asia and the Middle East right now. So a lot of focus there. Some of the countries there are masking up once again as a result. So something to keep an eye on for sure.SEANA SMITH: Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that.]"

AstraZeneca AZN said a combination of its cancer drugs, Lynparza and Imfinzi met the primary goal in an advanced ovarian cancer study. The FDA approved Merck’s MRK blockbuster medicine, Keytruda, in combination with Seagen’s SGEN Padcev for a bladder cancer indication. The regulatory agency also accepted Pfizer’s PFE regulatory application seeking approval of its cancer drugs Braftovi + Mektovi in a lung cancer indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&amp;J Offers $8.96B to Settle Talc Lawsuits: J&amp;J filed for voluntary bankruptcy through its subsidiary, LTL Management, for the second time to equitably resolve all present and future talc-related claims. J&amp;J faces thousands of lawsuits, which allege that its baby powder and other talc products contain asbestos that causes cancer, mainly ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. To completely resolve its cosmetic talc litigation, J&amp;J has agreed to pay $8.9 billion over a period of 25 years. This amount is much higher than the $2 billion that the company had committed alongside LTL’s first bankruptcy filing in October 2021. However, in January this year, an appeals court rejected J&amp;J’s first bankruptcy filing via LTL Management LLC.FDA Approves Merck’s Keytruda Plus Padcev in Bladder Cancer: The FDA granted accelerated approval to Merck’s Keytruda plus Seagen’s antibody-drug conjugate, Padcev for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer in patients who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The accelerated approval was based on the tumor response rate and the durability of response data from some cohorts of the phase Ib/II KEYNOTE-869 study (also known as EV-103 study), which was conducted in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas. This is the first approval for a combination of an anti-PD-1 inhibitor and an antibody-drug conjugate in the United States in this patient group.Story continuesAstraZeneca’s Lynparza + Imfinzi Improve PFS in Ovarian Cancer Study: AstraZeneca and partner Merck announced interim data from the DUO-O phase III study, which evaluated a combination of Lynparza, Imfinzi plus chemotherapy and bevacizumab versus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (control arm) in newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer without tumor BRCA mutations. In the study, the Lynparza plus Imfinzi arm demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus the control arm.However, another arm, which comprised Imfinzi, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, did not reach statistical significance for PFS at the interim analysis.The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave a positive opinion, recommending approval of AstraZeneca’s rare disease drug Ultomiris for the treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive (Ab+). Ultomiris is also under review in the United States for the treatment of NMOSD. Ultomiris was added to AstraZeneca’s portfolio with the acquisition of Alexion and is already approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myasthenia gravis in the United States, EU and Japan.FDA Accepts Pfizer’s Braftovi + Mektovi sNDAs in NSCLC: The FDA accepted Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) seeking approval of its cancer drugs Braftovi + Mektovi in BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.The FDA’s decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. The sNDAs were based on data from the PHAROS study, which evaluated Braftovi plus Mektovi in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC. In the study, PHAROS met its primary endpoint of objective response rate. At present Braftovi + Mektovi is approved for BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma, while Braftovi, as a monotherapy, is approved for BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 4.43% in the last five trading sessions.Here’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, all the stocks were in the green, with J&amp;J rising the most (8%).In the past six months, AstraZeneca has risen the most (30.1%), while Roche has declined the most (8.5%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: SNY’s COPD Study Meets Goal, ABBV Parkinson’s Drug Gets CRL)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

206,ff16a29c-dce9-3f88-b5ea-cd54c6cebc45,FOXA,2023-04-08,Investors in Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) have made a favorable return of 34% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-fox-nasdaq-foxa-made-124450227.html,1680871490,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) share price is up 29% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Disappointingly, the share price is down 13% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fox While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last three years, Fox failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 0.6% (annualized).Based on these numbers, we think that the decline in earnings per share may not be a good representation of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The modest 1.5% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It may well be that Fox revenue growth rate of 6.4% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Fox will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Fox the TSR over the last 3 years was 34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveFox shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), falling short of the market return. Meanwhile, the broader market slid about 9.6%, likely weighing on the stock. Investors are up over three years, booking 10% per year, much better than the more recent returns. Sometimes when a good quality long term winner has a weak period, it's turns out to be an opportunity, but you really need to be sure that the quality is there. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Fox (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

This was a welcome turn of events after a difficult 2022 for investors. However, after the rally, you may wonder which are the most undervalued stocks still out there in the market today.That’s an especially good question as it seems unlikely that the current market volatility has ended. The war in Ukraine drags on, the regional banking system is under fire, inflation is too high and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates.All this makes it imperative that investors buy the most undervalued stocks to ensure a margin of safety in this unsettled economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThere are, of course, a lot of different metrics folks can use to identify the most undervalued stocks. For the sake of this article, I’ll be picking seven of the best companies from Morningstar’s 5-star stock category, as these come from the small list of companies that their analysts believe are trading at dramatic discounts to fair value.CCitigroup$45.90AVTAvnet$44.06BRBroadridge Financial Solutions$143.35PYPLPayPal$75.37GPNGlobal Payments$103.81SABRSabre $7.20VZVerizon Communications$39.36Citigroup (C)bank customer sliding money to teller at bank deskSource: Syda Productions / Shutterstock.comCitigroup (NYSE:C) has a reputation for running into trouble. The bank played its cards poorly during the 2008 financial crisis, and it has had several other reputational stumbles since that point.That said, at some price, a firm’s issues are reflected in the valuation, and Citigroup is at that point.C stock tumbled once again in March following the broader concerns around the health of the American banking sector. The too-big-to-fail banks such as Citigroup should benefit as deposits move from regional banks to national banks. In a crisis, it’s better to be big, and Citigroup is one of the nation’s largest retail banks and is third in overall asset size.Story continuesThe valuation has also gotten silly. Shares are going for just half of book value. The stock is also selling for just seven times forward earnings. This sets Citigroup up to both repurchase stock and pay a 4.4% dividend yield. Morningstar believes C stock is worth $75, making it among the most undervalued stocks out there.Avnet (AVT)The logo for Avnet (AVT) is seen on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAvnet (NASDAQ:AVT) is an electronics distribution firm, focusing on reselling semiconductor chips and equipment. Its advantage comes from scale. There are few players that have as broad a reach and depth of connections in its industry. To that point, Avnet generates roughly $25 billion in annual revenues.But, given the current glut in the semiconductor market, traders have refused to give Avnet the valuation multiple it deserves, which is what puts it among the most undervalued stocks.In fact, astonishingly enough, AVT stock is selling at just six times forward earnings. Sure, the semiconductor cycle is currently on the downswing. But, distributors take much less risk than the actual manufacturers or chip designers. Avnet has proven to be robust in past semiconductor cycles.And, in the meantime, the company is returning cash to shareholders both via a 2.5% dividend and its huge buyback program. The company bought back 8% of its outstanding shares in the past 12 months alone. That’s what makes it one of the most undervalued stocks you’re missing out on.Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)3d render illustration of bank symbols of various size. Earnings reports soon.Source: Hermin / Shutterstock.comBroadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is an unheralded financial services company. The firm is integral to much of what makes Wall Street tick.It got its start as a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). ADP had built up an operation to process shareholder proxy statements that didn’t fit with its core payroll business. And thus, Broadridge was born.In subsequent years, Broadridge has added management and document processing for wealth managers, investment banks, and other such financial professionals. It also maintains a near monopoly on proxy services.This is an ideal sort of business. It provides an integral service to brokerages, investment banks and other end clients. And its fees are low enough to not be a meaningful part of its customers’ bottom line. And, with minimal competition, Broadridge has been able to maintain fat profit margins.Broadridge shares have traded flat since 2020 while earnings growth continues to hum along. As a result, shares are now going for just 21 times forward earnings. Morningstar believes shares are worth $185, versus a current price of $145. Given Broadridge’s tremendous earnings growth track record, investors are likely to bid the company back up to a more generous valuation in due time.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquartersPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seemed like an obvious winner in 2020. With people stuck at home, they’d have to move much of their financial lives to digital means. It wasn’t just e-commerce, PayPal seemed prepared to benefit from trends such as remote work and employers looked for new ways of hiring and paying their employees.However, the early surge in transaction volumes seen in 2020 and 2021 quickly faded. Along with that, the tech industry went into a tailspin. PYPL stock plunged from a high of $300 to just $76 today.That seems like an overreaction. Unlike many tech peers, PayPal is profitable. Shares are going for just 16 times forward earnings today. I’d also note that the company is continuing to grow revenues at nearly 10% a year, and analysts expect earnings growth of at least 10% annually going forward.PayPal’s core business, while slower, is still showing steady growth. The stock price, however, would suggest that things were far worse than they actually are. To that point, Morningstar believes PYPL stock is worth $135 per share which offers tremendous upside from today’s price.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) has gotten caught up in the same storm as PayPal. However, it’s arguably in an even better position. Unlike PayPal, nothing has gone wrong with Global Payments’ core business.That business, merchant acquiring, is attractive. Global Payments serves as a middleman between the credit card companies and vendors such as restaurants and retail stores. Global Payments provides payment terminals and related services such as fraud prevention, tax and accounting reporting, and transaction analysis.The payments industry has plummeted since 2021 thanks to firms like PayPal coming up short of investors’ lofty expectations. GPN stock has lost more than half its value since its peak two years ago.The thing is, Global Payments hasn’t had its operations impaired. In fact, earnings are continuing to grow at a double-digit clip, even as the stock price has plummeted. GPN stock now trades at just 10 times forward earnings. Morningstar’s Brett Horn believes shares are fully 41% undervalued today.Sabre Corp (SABR)A photo of a woman in a face mask waiting to board an airplane.Source: Maridav/ShutterStock.comSabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the three primary global distribution systems (GDS) for airlines, hotels, and other travel industry companies. GDS operators serve as a marketplace between airlines, cruise lines, passenger railroads, etc. on one side, and buyers such as travel agents and online booking websites on the other.Sabre, and its two competitors, get a cut of every transaction that passes through these GDS ticketing platforms. As airline traffic has come roaring back over the past two years, it has given the GDS firms a tailwind.That said, Sabre has failed to capitalize so far. It invested heavily in upgrades to its tech infrastructure just prior to the pandemic. Business came to a halt before these upgrades could pay off; instead, Sabre ended up undercapitalised and in financial trouble.The company has struggled to get back on track and reach profitability. However, there’s a high-quality business lying under the surface here. Morningstar believes Sabre can take flight once again; its analyst pegs fair value at $10.50 versus today’s price in the low $4 range.Verizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of America’s three prominent mobile telephony providers. Traditionally, investors have gravitated to these companies thanks to their stable cash flows and large dividends.However, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) threw a spanner in the works when it slashed its dividend. Investors dumped both AT&amp;T and Verizon shares following that. But AT&amp;T’s problems were self-inflicted, related to that firm taking on excess debt to make unsuccessful acquisitions.Verizon, by contrast, is still in a strong competitive position. Yes, it has seen a slowdown in earnings growth recently. That has come as Verizon has invested heavily in 5G and other next-generational telecom infrastructure. However, these investments should pay off in due time. Meanwhile, VZ stock has gotten absolutely hammered over the past year, with shares losing nearly a quarter of their value.It’s rare that telecom companies end up being dramatically mis-priced. But Morningstar believes that is exactly the situation with Verizon today. Analyst Michael Hodel pegs fair value at $57 per share versus a current price of $39. The massive discount available today probably won’t last long, and in the meantime, shares offer a 6.7% dividend yield.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, GPN, BR stock.

This provides significant opportunities for ExxonMobil’s Low Carbon Solution business.ExxonMobil’s latest investment is about 40% of its overall $17 billion allocated to low-emission initiatives through 2027.

Unlike its peers, the company has stayed away from renewable energy and relied on reducing emissions from its operations.Due to the growing urgency from investors and environmentalists to curb climate change, creating a more reliable roadmap to energy transition is necessary to address climate priorities and energy security challenges for a secure and sustainable energy future.ExxonMobil predicts a future less exposed to commodity price fluctuations through predictable, long-term contracts with customers attempting to reduce their carbon footprints.

The company’s refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. Valero, with ownership interests in 15 petroleum refineries, has a combined throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day.Valero boasts that its premium refining operations are resilient even when the business operating environment is carbon-constrained. Its refining business has the capabilities to generate handsome cashflows, which will allow it to return capital to shareholders and back growth projects.Valero’s renewable diesel segment involves the Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture, which is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America. The joint venture is between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero. Low-carbon fuel policies across the globe are primarily aiding the demand for renewable diesel, driving Valero’s Renewable Diesel business.With the commissioning of the DGD Port Arthur facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, DGD’s combined renewable diesel production capacity increased by 470 million gallons per year to 1.2 billion gallons per year. In 2023, Valero’s renewable diesel margins are expected to be consistent with the current levels.Valero’s board of directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend from 98 cents per share to $1.02. The dividend hike raises the company’s annualized cash dividend rate to $4.08 per share.Valero’s commitment to the energy transition is commendable. The company is on track to reduce and displace Refinery GHG emissions by 63% through investments in board-approved projects by 2025.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Molson Coors Canada (TSE:TPX.B) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Molson Coors Canada:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.048 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$26b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Molson Coors Canada has an ROCE of 4.8%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Beverage industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Canada roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you're interested in investigating Molson Coors Canada's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 4.8%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 122%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Story continuesOur Take On Molson Coors Canada's ROCEA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Molson Coors Canada has. Given the stock has declined 20% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Molson Coors Canada  that we think you should be aware of.While Molson Coors Canada isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The impact of the same was seen in the fourth quarter of 2022 wherein both revenues and earnings increased year over year. The company is also benefiting from its commitment toward innovation and premiumization.Let’s Delve DeeperMolson Coors is keeping on track with its revitalization plan. The plan is focused on achieving sustainable top- and bottom-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities.The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space. It also plans to develop digital competencies for employees, supply-chain-related system capabilities and commercial functions.In the second quarter of 2022, Molson Coors increased dollar share in the United States for the first time in more than 10 years, achieving its goal of revitalizing the company globally. Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet's combined strength led to an increase in the industry share in the United States, which was fueled by better branding and marketing. National champion brands, including Molson Canadian and Carling beer in UK saw sizable market share gains.Molson Coors, one of the largest brewers in the world, is committed to grow its market shares through innovation and premiumization. The firm has been rapidly expanding its above premium portfolio over the past few years in an effort to accelerate portfolio premiumization.The company emphasized that it is working to reshape its product portfolio and grow in emerging markets. Sales of its U.S. above-premium portfolio outperformed those of its U.S. economy portfolio due to the hard seltzer category's rapid expansion, Simply Spiked Lemonade's successful launch and the continued strength of Blue Moon and Peroni's.The company’s fourth-quarter results gained from strength in the core brands, particularly Coors Light and Miller Lite as well as the above premium portfolio and contributions from its Revitalization Plan. In the said period, the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line missed the same.

On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 3.8% due to positive pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWrapping UpMolson Coors continues to experience lower brand and financial volume as well as ongoing inflationary pressures. In addition, sluggishness in the beer industry as a result of pricing actions and inflationary pressures acts as a deterrent.

The 2023 New York International Auto Show is back and it's better than ever! This year's show is all about the latest and greatest in electric vehicle (EV) technology, design, and innovation. With so many new EV pickups available this year, some in the auto industry are calling 2023 ""the year of the EV pickup.""Electric vehicles are taking center stage as major automakers, like Ram (STLA), Ford (F), Hyundai (HYMTF) and more, showcase their newest models and highlight refreshes to existing lineups. Yahoo Finance spoke to auto experts and executives about the latest developments.Yahoo Finance’s Dave Briggs spoke to Ram Brand CEO Mike Koval Jr. about its all-new EV pickup truck, which many are calling a game-changer in the industry. The Ram EV pickup aims to take on established players in the market, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck.Ford was one the more popular exhibits at the show, where the Mustang Mach-E was getting a lot of attention. Ford Chief Engineer Laurie Transou, only the second female engineer at Ford, and a second-generation Ford employee, discussed the future of the Mustang and other Ford vehicles, and how the company is working to stay at the forefront of EV innovation.Edmunds.com also had a presence at the event. Dave Briggs spoke to the site's Editor-in-Chief Alistair Weaver, who shared some of the best new offerings in the EV market for consumers. They also spoke about the narrowing cost-of-ownership gap between EV and ICE (internal combustion engines).AAA Northeast Senior Manager Public Affairs Robert Sinclair Jr., Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association President Mark Schienberg and J.D. Power VP of EV Practice Elizabeth Krear all weighed in on what’s next in EV, including pricing and supply. J.D. Power shared their remarkable forecast for EV adoption.Although Tesla was absent from the show (as is typical for these kind of events), Yahoo Finance’s Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian explored how the company's new pricing strategy and Tesla's impact on the industry as a whole.Story continuesHyundai’s IONIQ 6 not only won 2023’s World Car award, but also, the company made a big announcement at the show, unveiling its all-new Kona.

Sales at some of the biggest electric vehicle makers, from GM to Tesla, are hitting records. New federal tax credits, new state laws, and what consumers love most, a competitive market with prices dropping is leading to an increase in consumer demand.And the auto industry is responding, going all-in on electric vehicles, spending hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development, all to develop the next in EV. We're at the 2023 New York International Auto Show, where that bet on the future is on full display. The hottest new models, the latest tech, and the challenges for both the industry and consumers-- we've got it all covered and the ""Next in EV.""Welcome everyone to this special presentation at the New York International Auto Show, a lot to get to, including the hottest vehicles, the latest tech. But, first, many are calling 2023 the year of the EV pickup. And Ram is charging ahead in that capacity. I spoke with RAM Brands CEO Mike Kovel Jr. about that.There's some hesitation among pickup truck lovers that it doesn't have the power they need. Does this?MIKE KOVAL JR.: It sure does. And that's the one thing that our customer has demanded of us. And they said, Mike, we'll come along for the ride with you. We're hesitant, we're nervous, but do not compromise on the core attributes that we care about the most, which historically has been towing and payload, but more importantly is about charge time and range in the future. And Ram will offer a better suite of solutions, which is what we announced today.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, first, let's start with the towing capacity because that's what I hear from pickup truck drivers all the time. How does it compare?MIKE KOVAL JR.: Up to 14,000 of towing capability. That's actually more than my ICE-equipped versions. 2,700 pounds of payload and we also, in terms of range, we offer a 168 standard kilowatt hour battery, which affords you up to 350 miles of range. But if range is really your primary purchase reason, you can opt up for the 229-kilowatt hour battery pack, which affords you up to 500 miles.DAVE BRIGGS: And that appears to be the real moat, if you will, between this and its nearest competitors.MIKE KOVAL JR.: Yeah, that's-- and that's what we've heard. We've heard that a lot of range anxiety, especially while towing, and we think Ram has been able to push past what our competitors have announced today. But I will tell you this, as good as these numbers are, we're not done yet. We also confirmed today that we will, shortly after the Ram 1500 Revolution launches next year, we're going to introduce a Ram 1500 Rev XR for extended range version, which will offer even more class-shattering range than what we've revealed today on the pure battery-electric model.DAVE BRIGGS: You care to tell us what that range is?MIKE KOVAL JR.: I would love to and I will do so very soon.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, what about sticker price for the Rev 1500?MIKE KOVAL JR.: A little bit closer, a little closer to when we get-- to when we start production. But suffice it to say I, like you-- I'm a consumer as well. There's a big elephant in the room. The cost of electrification is very real. But in my view, in my humble opinion, if we're not creating electrification that's available to the masses, I'm not really sure what we're doing. And the good news is we are starting to see a little bit of relief in some of the materials that are going into the product, which is good news. And I think, just like any new tech, it'll start high and it'll come down over time. And we're starting to see some of that.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, so biggest obstacle between mass adoption for EVs like this across the country is we get beyond 6% or 7% market penetration, how do we get there?MIKE KOVAL JR.: Yeah, so it's going to be gradual, right? And I think especially because we can't-- trucks still need to do truck things. They need a tow, they need to haul. That's the one thing, as I mentioned that-- please don't compromise. Electrification cannot be a limitation. And so provided we stay true to those roots, we will bring our customers along with us on this journey. I don't expect us to change overnight. But I will say, if you look at the adoption projection through the end of the decade, our internal projection is actually more bullish than that, believe it or not. So we're all-in. And I think this is-- the Ram 1500 Rev is the first signal that Ram is in.DAVE BRIGGS: Arguably, no company is more plugged in to all things EV than Edmunds. And I spoke to their editor-in-chief, Alastair Weaver, about the challenges, the opportunities, and, of course, the vehicles.The Kia EV9 just debuted moments ago. And, Alastair, Edmunds calls it a potential game changer in EVs. Why?ALISTAIR WEAVER: Well, what's interesting about this guy is a proper three-row family EV. We've seen a lot of smaller EVs. This is a three-row similar in size to Kia Telluride, but this is a pure electric vehicle.DAVE BRIGGS: And there's been a lot of interesting debuts here. Talk about the Genesis debut we saw earlier, a concept car, as well as the Ram EV pickup. What stands out?MIKE KOVAL JR.: Yeah, the Genesis-- Genesis is a brand that's on a real roll at the moment. That's Hyundai's luxury brand-- GV80 Coupe concept, which isn't really a concept at all and that it's heading for production. And then RAM, they're a little bit behind the Ford Lightning and there's a Chevy Silverado EV this year, but Ram making a big noise about that new electric truck. So everybody's getting into the EV game.DAVE BRIGGS: Who's really leading in that pickup space, that's got a lot of buzz over the last year?ALISTAIR WEAVER: Well, of course, Ford were first to market with the F-150 Lightning. Chevy's heading-- hitting the market this year with the Silverado EV. And now RAM is saying, we might not be first, but we're going to be better, we're going to have more range, we're going to have more usability. So they got the opportunity to see what other people are doing and now they're coming with their own alternative.DAVE BRIGGS: What are consumers telling you that they want when it comes to EVs? We get a lot of headlines, but there is still a lot of hesitation.ALISTAIR WEAVER: It is. And I think the whole cliche about range anxiety is real. And a lot of that relates to the charging infrastructure in the US, which-- I mean, I live in LA, which is EV central, and even there it's not great. So this is something that has to be solved. I know there's a lot of investment going into it, but, you know, if you have an EV, you really need to charge it at home. And then if you're going road tripping, how are you going to charge it? Are the chargers going to work? Are they going to be full? And this is causing a lot of anxiety. And it's real anxiety. It's justified anxiety.DAVE BRIGGS: EVs were steadily ticking up and then came 2022 and they really took a jump. Why that noticeable jump up in sales and adaptability?ALISTAIR WEAVER: Well, I think the first thing is there a lot more product coming into the market. I mean, for a long time Tesla almost had the market to themselves and now everybody's getting into the game-- the luxury brands, the mainstream brands. So there's a lot more choice for consumers, awareness is going up. Infrastructure is not great, but it's getting better. And so, you know, prices are still more than a gas alternative but, you know, getting more accessible. So I think people are just starting to look at it and say, yeah, this is for me.DAVE BRIGGS: Edmunds says there's about a $12,000 average sticker price gap. How important are gas prices when it comes to the consumer's desire to buy an EV? Did we see a spike when we were north of $4 a gallon?ALISTAIR WEAVER: Well, certainly on Edmunds we see a massive spike in consideration as soon as gas prices go up. We can actually see on our website what people are searching for. And as soon as the gas prices go up, suddenly EVs and hybrids-- people start looking. And so obviously it's very state-specific, with gas prices differing from state to state. But it is a consideration. And what consumers have to do is offset the higher cost of an EV to purchase with the fact that you're going to save a lot of money in fuel costs.DAVE BRIGGS: The other thing that really jumps out to me here at the New York International Auto Show is the interior-- and I'm talking tech. These displays are like the flat screen in my family room. They're getting bigger, more vibrant. Why is that a concern at all?ALISTAIR WEAVER: I mean, it's a big deal, isn't it? It's like how big is your screen is now a key selling point. It's like, as you say, how big is your TV? I mean, I personally think they're quite distracting. And there's a lot of work going in to improving, you know, the UX and the UI to try and make them work on the move. But you're right. I mean, I was in a-- the new Ram EV truck. It's got three screens. It's got one in front of your eyes. It's got a massive one in the middle, then a third one in front of the passenger. So it's just-- you know, our cars are becoming pretty distracting.DAVE BRIGGS: Still ahead, we'll take a cruise around some of the more popular exhibits here at the New York International Auto Show. But first, Ford-- EV sales are up 41%, but they're still bringing the muscle. We spoke to the chief engineer of the 5-liter V-8 Mustang Dark Horse.Laurie, nice to see you. What makes this beautiful car so different than the Mustangs we've experienced in the past.LAURIE TRANSOU: Yeah. Hi, Dave, thanks for having us here today. We have a brand new interior with a fully digital immersive cockpit. You can see the exterior has very modern and edgy styling and then, of course, our powertrains. Mustang's all about power-- next generation 2.3-liter and the next generation 5-liter. Our 5-liter actually delivers 500 horsepower in the Dark Horse, so amazing horsepower.DAVE BRIGGS: Obviously, the Ford Mustang Mach-E is the only top five selling EV not named Tesla. And people have really received it well. What makes it different than others on the market.LAURIE TRANSOU: Yeah, absolutely. The thing that makes it different is it's part of the Mustang family. So it has several cues that are very tied to all of our Mustang products. So it's got amazing performance, very distinctive styling, and it's fun to drive. So we're super excited to have it part of our Mustang family.DAVE BRIGGS: What's happening to the traditional gearheads now that EVs are becoming so popular? Are they dying out?LAURIE TRANSOU: Absolutely not. There's gearheads in every generation and actually our Mustang is specifically targeting the next generation of enthusiasts. So we want to, of course, make sure we maintain our enthusiasts that we love today, but we're going to grow it to that next generation of young people who are interested in a fun sports car.DAVE BRIGGS: Ford has a goal of 600,000 EVs produced this year, 2 million by 2026. EV sales up 41%. You have had some challenges in that regard, what's the biggest obstacle into getting to those massive numbers and mass adaptability?LAURIE TRANSOU: For Mach-E, we are growing volume-- end of the year 270,000 units-- and that's to meet our demand. So we've got really strong demand, it's an amazing product.DAVE BRIGGS: Supply chain issues really were the theme of the last couple of years in the auto industry. Where are those issues? Are they beginning to clear?LAURIE TRANSOU: Yeah. Right now, we're not seeing any for Mustang. We are on top of it. We have a team that's constantly looking at supply chain, chip issues. And if they see something on the horizon, they reach out immediately, and we develop an action plan.DAVE BRIGGS: Of course, when it comes to EVs, one automaker stands high above the rest. But you won't find them here, so senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian went to them, just a few blocks from the Auto Show.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: The New York Auto Show is here. And as attendees rushed through the gates of the Javits Center to see what's latest and greatest and what's next in the world of EVs, what they won't be seeing is this brand-- Tesla.[MUSIC PLAYING]That's right-- Tesla. Tesla doesn't really go to auto shows in general or even industry events. They usually do their own thing. And what they've been doing lately is dominating the field of EVs from both a production but also a scale point of view. And now Tesla is leading in a new area-- pricing. Only weeks ago they threw down the gauntlet, hurrying prices on the Model 3 Model Y cars by thousands of dollars. Rivals like Ford, and even Chinese rivals, have to cut prices in order to compete against Tesla's latest move. And right on cue, Tesla reported Q1 delivery numbers that were record highs for the company, as they showed that cutting prices boosted demand considerably.And 2023 is not only a big year for EVs and EV SUVs, in general, but also pickups. This year at the show, the RAM Revolution EV pickup will be there, as well as the Chevy Silverado EV, in addition to the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup. Now, what's not going to be there again is Tesla and their Cybertruck. Cybertruck, Tesla says, has over 100,000 pre-orders and it will go into production later this year.DAVE BRIGGS: Still ahead, some major news from Hyundai. We'll talk to their North America CEO in just a bit. But first, 700-plus cars on display here, one clear theme-- the EV surge is here.[MUSIC PLAYING]It's a great time to be shopping for an electric vehicle. Automakers are expected to spend over a trillion dollars in the next decade to develop and deliver the next big thing in EVs. Tesla spends the most on R&amp;D per car sold. It also sells the most EVs, taking four of the top five spots in 2022. But other companies are catching up.ELIZABETH KREAR: We actually talk to new vehicle shoppers every single month. And we asked them, are you interested in purchasing an electric vehicle? 27% say, yes, very, very likely. And the number one brand has consistently been Tesla, but the last few months, we've seen Chevy overtake them in brand consideration and Ford is right there behind them.DAVE BRIGGS: More choice, competitive prices, and generous government subsidies are all powering the EV market right now. But one big issue standing in the way of electric vehicle adoption-- charging ports.ROBERT SINCLAIR: Now, if you've got a charging station at home, you got a level 2 station, great. That helps a lot. We're still a little ways away from the great American road trip and an electric vehicle. You know, It's an ongoing process, things will get better. And folks get these things at home and then we get more and more infrastructure-- the bipartisan infrastructure bill will go a long way to doing that.DAVE BRIGGS: California leads the way with 44,000 charging ports, more than four times the number two on the list, New York. Naturally, some of the country's least populous states, like the Dakotas, have the least amount of EV chargers. And now even oil and gas companies are building charging stations. BP just announced a billion dollar investment in the US over the next several years.Charging stations are one piece of the puzzle. Another key element for mass adoption of EVs is buy-in from car dealerships. I caught up with Mark Schienberg the president-- the largest regional automobile dealer networks in the country and one of the organizers of the New York Auto Show. How hesitant are your dealers to making this full transition away from gas-powered?MARK SCHIENBERG: Well, any business person when you say, listen, you've got to invest a million dollars into this. They're going to go, yeah, show me the return on investment. But dealers are like a lot of entrepreneurs. They see a business climate, they understand that this is what is coming down the pipe, they need to come, you know, to work with it. It is a big investment on their part-- on it. But they do believe that this is where the business is going to be in the future.DAVE BRIGGS: One question on the mind of consumers-- can I afford an electric vehicle? We spoke to Elizabeth Krear, who heads up EVs for JD Power, about how important affordability is to customers.OK, Elizabeth, before we jump into the EV story, the car behind us is the Jeep Wrangler, one of the hottest Sellers out of COVID. In your opinion, why?ELIZABETH KREAR: Because it's a Jeep. I mean, Jeep has such brand loyalty. People love Jeep. And I think this one behind us is a 4xe, so it may be attracting some of the consumers that are looking for that EV option.DAVE BRIGGS: Seems to be that transfer from goods to experiences, people want to get out, and live, and travel, and that fits that. So let's talk about the EV story, which really changed in 2022 with market share nearly doubling. What happened?ELIZABETH KREAR: In 2022, there was an influx of new EV alternatives. So prior to that, it was primarily the premium segment. But in '22, a number of SUVs and truck EVs entered the market, something that we call mass market. And that really attracted a lot of new buyers.DAVE BRIGGS: There's still about a $12,000 price gap between gas and electric, how is pricing changing and how is that increasing EV market share?ELIZABETH KREAR: Price matters. Price absolutely matters. Total cost of ownership is very important to the consumer. And since last-- last year that number was $20,000 gap. This year it's actually 11. Our latest numbers show an $11,000 gap and that continues to be offset with federal tax incentives, utility incentives. There's a lot of players in the ecosystem that are helping to bring that cost down.DAVE BRIGGS: How important is that sub $30,000 level primarily represented by that Chevy Bolt?ELIZABETH KREAR: That's absolutely important also to have a vehicle that's less than $30,000 that's an EV. And, oh, by the way, that doesn't even include all of the money that the consumer is going to save over the life of the vehicle as they're using electricity instead of gasoline.DAVE BRIGGS: So what's the biggest stumbling block, roadblock between really mass adoption of EVs?ELIZABETH KREAR: The number one hesitation is infrastructure. Consumers-- the current owners primarily charge at home, but they want the confidence to know that charging is going to be there in the public where they need it, when they need it, at the speed.DAVE BRIGGS: Where is the biggest problem, the biggest gap when it comes to our charging network? And can it possibly get where it needs to be by 2035, when California and New York begin to phase out gas-powered vehicles?ELIZABETH KREAR: What we're seeing is what I call a shotgun approach. There's a number of stakeholders that are implementing charging. I think what we need is to make sure that it's in the right places. Where is the demand? Where is the adoption of EV having-- happening and making sure that charging is where the consumer's going to need it-- so location, time is critical-- also reliability.The chargers have been declining in reliability. One out of every five charging experience is a failure due to reliability. So that needs some improvement as well.DAVE BRIGGS: That's a shock. How are the automakers, how are the consumers going to be ready by 2035 to phase out gas-powered cars, because it's still more than 90% of market share?ELIZABETH KREAR: I think everybody-- that's the question that everybody is asking, right? But we do see automakers, we see utilities, we see governments, we see everybody taking a vested interest in the transition. And we're here to help that transition and make sure people have the information they need so that we get to the number as we need to and we know the changes that need to happen.DAVE BRIGGS: Where do you think market share will be by the end of the year and by, say, '25 or 6?ELIZABETH KREAR: Glad you asked. 2026, we anticipate forecasts that the market share will be 27%.DAVE BRIGGS: Wow.ELIZABETH KREAR: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: So what's the story this year in the EVs that you're most focusing on? What's next?ELIZABETH KREAR: I think it is what happens now that we're moving into the next phase customer. It's no longer the early adopter. There's a lot of mass market vehicles. And it's seeing how many of them-- as the supply chain issues get resolved-- because right now it's difficult to get them. There's announcement of them, but when consumers go to buy them, they can't get them. As that frees up, now we've got market scope. There's selection for them. Let's see how fast that market share rises.DAVE BRIGGS: It should be fun, Elizabeth. Thank you. Hyundai is making its presence felt here at the Auto Show, unveiling the Kona and Ioniq EVs. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith spoke to the North America CEO about how Hyundai is gaining ground in the space.RANDY PARKER: We're off to a terrific start at the New York International Auto Show. Because of the all new Ioniq 6, we won EV car of the year, we won design car of the year, and we also won world car of the year, so an impressive start. And you're absolutely right-- so we are launching the all new Ioniq 6 just went on sale last month. We're also launching the all new Kona EV, which we just highlighted to the press. And we also-- we're launching the Disney Platinum 100 Edition with our partnership through Disney, so a very special day for Hyundai in New York.SEANA SMITH: One of the things when we talk about electric vehicles, EV, is widespread adoption. What do you think is really necessary in order to convert some of those buyers out there who are a little bit hesitant right now to purchase their first EV?RANDY PARKER: Well, you know, the-- a great stepping stone for EV would be to take a look at a hybrid because I know a lot of people are very concerned about range. A good stepping stone would be to get into a hybrid vehicle and then slowly transition into it to an EV. The second thing I would say in terms of adoption is that in the United States we've got to improve the infrastructure. I myself drive a drive an electric car. I've got a level 2 charger in my garage and I got to tell you, I don't think I'll ever go back to driving an internal combustion engine vehicle. But I know for some people it's a little bit of a concern because of a range anxiety. But once you step into an EV, I don't think you'll ever go back to a gasoline car again.SEANA SMITH: Randy, pricing is another thing that's brought up a lot in terms of widespread adoption-- what's needed, lower pricing on EVs. We've got the Ioniq 6 right here and I believe that's just over $40,000. How do you see Hyundai-- or do you see Hyundai as a player here in the cheaper EVs-- anything below $30,000-- possibly.RANDY PARKER: Well, you know, the Kona EV will get you closer to that price point, right? The good thing about the Hyundai brand is that our goal is to try and create a seat for every purse. And we've got a wide range of EV vehicles that consumers can choose from at different price points.SEANA SMITH: And I know Hyundai is making a push to produce more of its vehicles here within the US.RANDY PARKER: That's right.SEANA SMITH: You guys had a multi-billion investment plan for production for Georgia. What can you tell us about that and why Georgia?RANDY PARKER: Yeah, we're very, very excited about our new EV meta plant that we're-- under construction right now in Savannah, Georgia. The investment is about $5.5 billion. It's going to create over 8,100 local jobs. We're also excited about that as well. And the state of Georgia-- they've been very instrumental in helping us, you know, break ground in Georgia and now we'll have two huge footprints in the United States, one in Montgomery, Alabama and the other one in Savannah, Georgia. So we're really, really excited about the future.SEANA SMITH: All right, Randy, well, we got the Ioniq 6 right behind us.RANDY PARKER: Yes.SEANA SMITH: I'm excited to get in this car. We're going to go take it for a spin, really get excited--RANDY PARKER: Let's go do it.SEANA SMITH: --get in there, figure out what has people so hyped up about this.RANDY PARKER: Let's go check it out, all right?[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: We got the sunroof open.RANDY PARKER: We got the sunroof.SEANA SMITH: All right, Randy, so tell me just all about the bells and whistles. Because when it comes to these new electric vehicles, everyone's so excited about what's on the screen and what you can do with it.RANDY PARKER: Well, the first thing is first-- I mean, you saw the how beautiful the car is, right?SEANA SMITH: Yes.RANDY PARKER: I mean, the silhouette, the streamliner design.SEANA SMITH: Very futuristic.RANDY PARKER: The car is absolutely gorgeous, right? There you go.SEANA SMITH: The 360 view.RANDY PARKER: The 360--SEANA SMITH: You can see our producer's in the background here, but certainly you really get-- because I think you can-- you drag your finger-- here we go. Maybe that?RANDY PARKER: You can spin it around.SEANA SMITH: There we go a spin it around. That's really incredible.RANDY PARKER: Now tell me that's not pretty cool, right?SEANA SMITH: Let's talk about range because that's something that really sets the Ioniq 6 apart from some of its competitors out there.RANDY PARKER: Sure.SEANA SMITH: What does that range look like and how do you keep track of it?RANDY PARKER: Yeah, that's a great question. So the range is 361 miles on a full charge. And you can see right here in front of me on the screen-- right now, this particular car has a range of 141 miles, so it's been driven around the track a few times. It's by far the most range that we have in any of the Hyundai brands. So at 361, you can pretty much go from LA to Las Vegas on a full charge.SEANA SMITH: That's good because a lot of people get that range anxiety. We've been talking about it so much when it comes to EVs. Randy, from your perspective, Ioniq 6, lots of comparison out there to the Tesla Model 3, what do you make of that?RANDY PARKER: Tesla who?[LAUGHTER]Well you know what, I can't speak to the Tesla. You know, of course, I'm biased. But the Ioniq 6, from a design standpoint and a technology standpoint, I don't think you can do any better.DAVE BRIGGS: That's it for what's next in EVs, but the electric revolution is truly just beginning.

But as consumers walk the auto show floor at New York’s Jacob Javits Convention Center, what will be top of mind?Yahoo Finance’s Dave Briggs spoke to Elizabeth Krear, J.D. Power’s VP of EV Practice, to discuss the growing demand for electric vehicles and how traditional car manufacturers are starting to catch up with Tesla (TSLA) in this market.Briggs also caught up with Robert Sinclair, AAA’s Northeast Senior Manager of Public Affairs and Mark Schienberg, the President of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, to discuss the future of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and more.Click here to watch the Yahoo Finance special: Next in EV.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: Still ahead, some major news from Hyundai. We'll talk to their North America CEO in just a bit. But first, 700-plus cars on display here. One clear theme, the EV surge is here.[MUSIC PLAYING]It's a great time to be shopping for an electric vehicle. Automakers are expected to spend over a trillion dollars in the next decade to develop and deliver the next big thing in EVs. Tesla spends the most on R&amp;D per car sold. It also sells the most EVs, taking four of the top five spots in 2022. But other companies are catching up.ELIZABETH KREAR: We actually talk to new vehicle shoppers every single month. And we ask them, are you interested in purchasing an electric vehicle? 27% say yes, very, very likely. And the number one brand has consistently been Tesla. But the last few months, we've seen Chevy overtake them in brand consideration, and Ford is right there behind them.DAVE BRIGGS: More choice, competitive prices, and generous government subsidies are all powering the EV market right now. But one big issue standing in the way of electric vehicle adoption, charging ports.Story continuesROBERT SINCLAIR: Now if you've got a charging station at home, you've got a level 2 station, great. That helps a lot. We're still a little ways away from the great American road trip in an electric vehicle. You know, it's an ongoing process. Things will get better when folks get these things at home, and then we get more and more infrastructure. The bipartisan infrastructure bill will go a long way to doing that.DAVE BRIGGS: California leads the way, with 44,000 charging ports, more than four times the number two on the list, New York. Naturally, some of the country's least populous states, like the Dakotas, have the least amount of EV chargers. And now, even oil and gas companies are building charging stations. BP just announced $1,000,000,000 investment in the US over the next several years.Charging stations are one piece of the puzzle. Another key element for mass adoption of EVs is buy in from car dealerships. I caught up with Mark Schienberg, the president of the largest regional automobile dealer networks in the country and one of the organizers of the New York Auto Show.How hesitant are your dealers to making this full transition away from gas powered?MARK SCHIENBERG: Well, any business person, when you say, listen, you've got to invest $1,000,000 into this, they're going to go, yeah, show me the return on investment. But dealers are like a lot of entrepreneurs. They see a business climate. They understand that this is what is coming down the pipe. They need to come to work with it. It is a big investment on their part on it. But they do believe that this is where the business is going to be in the future.]"

Or so investors hope.This week brought a host of misses on closely watched economic data — from the ADP employment report and ISM manufacturing data to JOLTs (the job openings report). Sure, with a 236,000 increase in March, the non-farm payrolls beat estimates slightly. But the figure was below the year-to-date average increase of 344,000 — so it also sort of tapped into the gloomier data mood.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The subsequent vibe on Wall Street is that the economy may be hitting a soft patch after the March banking turmoil and after yet another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.""Risk-off sentiment has continued to grow in markets thanks to another round of weak data that’s added to fears about a potential U.S. recession,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid warned.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) all saw buyer's fatigue in the wake of the data letdowns.What didn't lack interest? Safe-haven trades such as gold, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund. Oddly enough, speculative AI names like BigBear.ai (BBAI) and SoundHound (SOUN) caught bids (here's what pros told me about this move).Amid all this activity, here are three things you may have missed this week.1. The New York Auto Show is in townWith the auto show in town, Yahoo Finance was working the scene all week to report on the latest and greatest in everything mobility.GM's (GM) CFO Paul Jacobson told me over lunch that there are no plans to turn a car's cockpit into one giant subscription service. That's reassuring considering some automakers have pondered charging subscriptions for heated seats.Story continuesThe interior of the Chrysler Airflow concept is displayed at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023. REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoAnd yes, Tesla came up at lunch — mostly from the view of GM looking to take a bite out of the EV leader's rich profit margins in the category.Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance's Dave Briggs found three hot trends in autos you need to know about; here's Briggs from the auto show floor. Shout out to our friends at our sister publication Autoblog — I really enjoyed checking out these pics on new vehicle models.2. Brace for bad chip earningsAn old boss once told me to always be on the lookout for trends. In the spirit of that, I am tossing a red flag onto the field for the approaching earnings season in the semiconductor industry.With U.S. markets closed on Friday, Samsung (005930.KS) did its best to sneak in an under-the-radar major warning on its business. The chip giant said it would make a ""meaningful"" cut to its production amid still bloated inventory levels that are weighing on prices.This is the same bearish tone markets heard from fellow chip-maker Micron (MU) when it reported earnings a few weeks ago.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.None of this is a good setup for chip-maker earnings that begin trickling in later this month. I would argue it doesn't augur well for results from PC makers such as HP Inc. and Dell, either.Even an upgrade on Intel (INTC) on Monday didn't strike me as a ""screaming buy"" call on the stock.""We have been decidedly negative on Intel's prospects for quite some time, a stance clearly justified by the company's utter collapse as a weakening market and poor decisions shaved billions off the top line, burned billions in cash, and crashed the stock price by almost 50% since CEO Pat Gelsinger arrived,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote. ""But while things still look bad, tactically we believe the medium-term set-up is, finally, improving a bit, as the company's issues are known, and numbers (for the first time in a while) may be low enough to stand.""3. McDonald's is having a momentBelieve me, after spending years covering the restaurant industry as a consumer reporter, a highly paid communications person at McDonald's (MCD) wants nothing more in life than to see their beloved fast food brand mentioned favorably somewhere in media land.Since I am in a positive mood after my birthday, I have a morsel of happiness for folks at McDonald's (and their investors) to chew on.Two calls on McDonald's from a report by longtime restaurant analyst Andy Barish at Jefferies caught our attention:""We continue to be encouraged by the Famous Meals platform as evidence of MCD's powerful brand and marketing relevancy, not to mention the same-store sales upticks and opportunity for digital engagement with loyalty &amp; mobile app usage, particularly among younger customers,"" Barish wrote. ""While we concede there is a limit to how many times they organize current menu items into a combo with a celebrity name attached and still expect big consumer buzz/sales results, Google search data indicates the recent Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal starting on Valentine's Day saw a similar level of attention as the successful J Balvin and Saweetie meals from Oct '20 and Aug '21, respectively, and only lagged the Travis Scott and BTS Meals (which had average tickets 50% lower or more given the Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal is targeted for 2 people, and the BTS Meal likely benefited from a larger and younger worldwide fanbase).""And then this:""Google search data (below) also shows “chicken big mac” is trending well in the U.S. even though it isn't available here...yet,"" the analyst added. ""This product is running as a limited-time offering in Canada, Ireland, and the UK. An August ’22 test in select Miami stores also generated a high level of Google search interest relative to MCD’s popular 'Famous Meal' LTO platform. Should the Chicken Big Mac come to U.S. stores, especially as chicken breast prices moderate, we think it would see high demand.""Another nugget: McDonald's shares are up 7.3% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% gain.The search for the chicken Big Mac.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Global Stocks to Buy.U.S. Stocks Vs Non-U.S. StocksOn February 28 director of institutional asset management at Ritholtz Wealth Management, Ben Carlson, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade where he talked about investing in U.S. stocks versus non-U.S. stocks. Carlson discussed how investing in the United States has long been viewed as a beneficial strategy due to the consistent positive returns over time. However, he discussed that there is potential for success in international investing as well. Carlson pointed out that according to The Credit Suisse Global Yearbook, since 1900 developed stock markets outside of the US have generated an average annual return of 4-6% after inflation adjustments. Carlson said that while international stocks have lagged since the global financial crisis of 2008 and U.S. tech stocks have driven outperformance, it is important to note that historically other regions of the world have done well.Ben Carlson said that non-US stocks have been looking ""way more attractive if you value them at anything, cash flows, earnings, price-to-book, whatever it is"". Carlson thinks this is because the U.S. is dominated by growth stocks, and primarily tech stocks, and there is more value oversees in financials, industrials, and materials stocks. Carlson noted that value stocks tend to do better in a period of high inflation and rising interest rates, such as the one we are in right now, and so he is bullish on non-U.S. stocks since they are ""mostly value stocks"".Ben Carlson further elaborated on the underperformance of international stocks relative to U.S. stocks in the past. He noted that there are several factors that contributed to this trend, including low interest rates, low inflation, and a strong dollar. Ben Carlson pointed out that between 1970 and 2008, ""international stocks and U.S. stocks were basically neck and neck"", however since then U.S. stocks have outperformed international stocks. Ben Carlson thinks that investing in international stocks is the value play right now, given higher inflation, higher interest rates, and a weak dollar.Story continuesWhile U.S. stocks have driven outperformance globally over the past decade, there is potential for success in other regions of the world, and a diversified portfolio can provide a balance of risk and return. We have compiled a list of the 12 best cheap global stocks to buy now according to hedge funds which include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.12 Cheap Global Stocks to BuySource:PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the best cheap global stocks to buy now, we screened for stocks that were trading at a PE multiple of less than 15, as of March 30. We sorted our screen by market cap and looked for large companies that have worldwide operations and draw at least 40% of their revenue from outside the U.S. We then sourced the hedge fund sentiment for each stock from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 elite hedge funds. We narrowed down our selection to the stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds and were the cheapest. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Where the number of hedge funds was the same, we used the PE ratio as the tie-breaker.Cheap Global Stocks to Buy12. TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE)PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 30: 7.98Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21This January, JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek raised his price target on TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) to EUR 73 from EUR 68 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. 21 hedge funds held stakes in the stock at the close of the fourth quarter of 2022.

(NYSE:SU).ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection in the energy sector was also a strong driver of returns, benefiting from an improving global macro outlook. Prospects for a milder recession, increased demand from China reopening from its COVID-19 restrictions, and the recognition that the market hasn’t discounted oil company valuations based on commodity prices all served to benefit energy company stock prices. Holdings such as TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE), a leading French oil, and natural gas company, was a recipient of these macro tailwinds. We are constructive on the long-term prospects of the energy sector, with it being the second largest relative overweight in the portfolio. We believe that as the market becomes more comfortable with the industry’s intermediate earnings and capital discipline from producers, our high-quality companies in the sector should continue to perform.”11.

As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature.

Yahoo Finance’s Dave Briggs gives his three takeaways from the floor of the show.First up, affordability. The sub-$30,000 Chevy Bolt EV is leading the charge. Affordability is a major factor in General Motors’ (GM) rise to number two in EV sales, surpassing Ford (F).

226,4b023048-7848-4ee8-a9e2-46ad9183eb3b,GM,2023-04-08,‘Everybody’s getting into the EV game’: Edmunds,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everybodys-getting-into-the-ev-game-edmunds-185003513.html,1680807003,STORY,"['TSLA', 'GM', 'F']","[Once upon a time, Tesla (TSLA) stood out as the biggest name in electric vehicles, spearheading the popularity of such cars in the U.S market.But Alistair Weaver, editor-in-chief of Edmunds, says those days are over.“There's a lot more product coming into the market,” Weaver recently told Yahoo Finance at the 2023 New York Auto Show. (Video above.) ""I mean, for a long time, Tesla almost had the market to themselves. And now everybody's getting into the game— the luxury brands, the mainstream brands.”Weaver cited several new-to-market EVs. For example, Ford's (F) F-150 Lightning and GM's (GM) Silverado EV. Also: the KIA EV9, which unlike most smaller EVs, is a three-row family car. And the much hyped Ram 1500 EV pickup, which Stellantis, Ram’s parent company, contends will lead the EV truck market in range, or the distance electric cars can travel on a full battery.“Ram is saying, we might not be first, but we're going to be better. We're going to have more range. We're going to have more usability,” Weaver said. ""So they've got the opportunity to see what other people are doing. And now they're coming with their own alternative.”Meanwhile, Edmunds, Weaver's publication sees increased interest in electric vehicles along with rising gasoline prices. “We can actually see on our website what people are searching for,” Weaver said. “And as soon as the gas prices go up, suddenly EVs and hybrids, people start looking.""The Kia EV9 is displayed at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023. REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoOther highlights from Weaver's Yahoo Finance interview:Supply bottlenecks: Though he says electric vehicles make up roughly 6 percent of the car market, the industry has recently experienced supply shortages—like anyone else. “So it's potentially a bit of a false market. As supply increases, then we might see the share go up as well” he said. “We're expecting it to keep creeping up, you know, as the years go by.”Tech overkills? Weaver took issue with the tech found in many new electric vehicles. For instance, he contended that three screens inside the new Ram EV truck were excessive. “I mean, it's a big deal, isn't it? It's like how big your screen is now a key selling point,” he said. “It's a bit like, as you say, how big is your TV? I mean, I personally think they're quite distracting.“Story continuesBad GM move: Weaver also criticized GM’s recent decision to eliminate Carplay, a feature that allows iPhones to connect to the car’s infotainment screen and sound system. “Sometimes the industry makes decisions, or people within the system make decisions that just sort of blow your mind,"" he said. “There’s been a big backlash online. So maybe they'll reverse the decision. Who knows? But a very strange one because that's what consumers are asking for.”Headwinds? Despite the EV excitement Weaver said the market faces challenges. For instance, electric vehicles can only travel as far as their battery permits and consumers often struggle to find nearby charging stations. “I think, you know, the whole cliche about range anxiety is real. And a lot of that relates to the charging infrastructure in the US, which, I mean, I live in LA, which is EV central. And even there, it's not great,” Weaver said. “So this is something that has to be solved.”Final thought: “There's a lot more choice for consumers. Awareness has gone up. Infrastructure is not great, but it's getting better,” Weaver said. “And so prices, you know, are still more than a gas alternative, but, you know, getting more accessible. So I think people are just starting to look at it and say, yeah, this is for me.”Dylan Croll is a reporter and researcher at Yahoo Finance.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.7%.Revenues are expected to be $5.62 billion, up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.43% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.49, delivering a surprise of -11.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

233,57c3b879-62e2-394e-be24-ebebc58a22fa,PNC,2023-04-08,PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $1.50,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-services-group-nyse-101815587.html,1680862695,STORY,['PNC'],"[The board of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $1.50 per share on the 5th of May. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.9%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.PNC Financial Services Group has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but PNC Financial Services Group's payout ratio of 42% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 16.2% over the next 3 years. The future payout ratio could be 44% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.historic-dividendPNC Financial Services Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that PNC Financial Services Group has grown earnings per share at 6.3% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.Story continuesWe Really Like PNC Financial Services Group's DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

Wall Street is avoiding the banks at all costs. And that includes all three of the major banking categories: the “too big to fail” big four, the regional banks and the thousands of community banks.But are things really that dire in the entire industry? Or are some banks now values?First quarter earnings reports will be key.

(PNC)PNC Financial is one of the larger regional banks, headquartered in Pittsburgh.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Target What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$273.4mUS$3.45bUS$4.13bUS$4.90bUS$5.60bUS$6.42bUS$7.02bUS$7.52bUS$7.94bUS$8.31bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.36%Est @ 7.17%Est @ 5.64%Est @ 4.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% -US$256US$3.0kUS$3.4kUS$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$178bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$178b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$92bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$128b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$166, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Target as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TargetStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Target, we've put together three essential elements you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does TGT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:ISRG) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-ownership-intuitive-surgical-inc-120018345.html,1680868818.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Intuitive Surgical's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 21 shareholders own 50% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuitive Surgical's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Intuitive Surgical is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.1% and 6.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$429m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuitive Surgical. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Growth Large Cap Stocks to Invest In. Investing in the stock market appears to be a daunting task, especially in today's age. While investors of the late 1900s and even the first decade of this millennium could rely on a handful of sources for their investment decisions, today's digital age is inundated with countless streams of financial information. Whether it's social media platforms such as Twitter or Reddit, or mainstream media like the Wall Street Journal or CNBC, for the everyday investor picking out the right stocks is often a daunting task.This investment journey is further complicated by the thousands of publicly listed stocks. For instance, the NASDAQ Composite one of the largest and most widely followed stock market indexes in the U.S. has more than 2,500 stocks listed on it. On the other hand, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) which is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization, has roughly 2,300 companies that trade exclusively on it. As a whole, according to the NYSE's estimates, there are 8,000 securities listed on U.S. exchanges.These securities are bifurcated based on their market capitalization. According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) - a private U.S. self regulator - there are five categories of stocks. These are micro, small, mid, large, and mega caps, with the market capitalization of the firms starting from less than $250 million for the micro segment and going above $200 billion for the mega cap companies.Each of these has its own set of advantages and drawbacks. For instance, micro cap companies can promise high returns through small share price movements but come at the risk of low liquidity. At the other end of the spectrum, mega cap stocks offer stability, but at the expense of a loss of return in the form of opportunity costs of having missed out on the smaller companies.Story continuesToday, we'll take a look at some high growth large cap stocks, out of which the top ones are Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), argenx SE (NASDAQ:ARGX), and Lucid Group, Inc.

These were then filtered out to only include those companies whose quarterly sales have grown by more than 30%. However, as is the case with most stock screeners, revenue growth estimates for several companies were flat out wrong. So, each entry in the list was manually verified to make sure that the screener had the right percentage and that the information was accurate. Out of the final list, the top fifteen were chosen, after taking special care to ensure that the growth came from their organic revenue and not one off factors.High Growth Large Cap Stocks to Invest In15.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect.2022 was one of the worst years for the stock market due to high inflation and rising interest rates. In October 2022, Mad Money's Jim Cramer spotted 14 potential buying opportunities among 59 stocks that made new lows. Cramer said at the time that these 14 stocks were ""about to pop"". Let's see which one of these have actually popped since then, but before that, let's look at how Cramer feels about the market situation right now.The Way to ""Whip Inflation Now"", According to CramerOn March 28, Jim Cramer spoke about the current inflation situation and the Fed. Jim Cramer noted that that while the Fed wants to tame inflation, it does not want to go as far as causing further bank failures, and so the Fed decided to go with a quarter-point rate hike instead of a half-point rate hike due to the recent banking crisis. Jim Cramer thinks that the Fed needs to stop raising interest rates further, however, it cannot unless ""wage inflation cools dramatically"". According to Cramer, there are two ways that the Fed can ""whip inflation now"". One way is that the Fed keeps raising interest rates, causing wage stagnation and hurting the housing and automotive sectors along with the overall economy. The other riskier way to get wage inflation in control is to create ""financial panic"". Here are some comments from Jim Cramer:""I think this bank crisis, or jam, if left to its own devices is equal to about 100 basis points of tightening, if it continues like this. A big bank failure is incredibly deflationary, it's perhaps the most deflationary thing that could happen to an entire economy. It's more shocking than endless rate hikes, but it gets the darn process over with, even with collateral damage that tends to be a lot worse. No I don't want it to be this way, believe me. This is a bad way to beat inflation, but it will definitely do the job.""Story continuesCramer thinks that the risk of further banking failures is not over yet. He also pointed out that as long as small banks continue to suffer from contagion risks, the Fed will need to continue raising interest rates. Cramer said that the only way the Fed's tightening cycle will end is if and when a large bank fails.As of March 30, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) has gained 10.12% over the past 6 months. Some of Cramer's ""about to pop"" stocks that have outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) include ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Let's now look at how all of Cramer's picks from October 2022 have performed relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past 6 months.14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In RetrospectOur MethodologyWe got Cramer's stocks from his October 2022 list of 14 stocks that were ""about to pop"" according to him. We calculated the 6-month returns of each of these stocks, as of March 30, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). The idea was to gauge the performance of Cramer's stock picks. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their 6-month returns, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect14. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 316-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -47.00%One of Jim Cramer's top picks from October 2022 was Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). The company is an American manufacturer of backup power generation facilities Cramer said that the he liked how low the stock was, enough to add it to his charitable trust. Shares of Generac Holdings Inc.

(NYSE:GNRC) and held stakes worth $588.2 million in the company. Of those, Ariel Investments was the top investor in the company and held a stake worth $132 million.Meridian Funds made the following comment about Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), is a manufacturer of power generation equipment with a leading position in home standby generators. Generac also offers consumers a home energy management system that harnesses and stores power from the sun to be used for backup during utility power outages. Severe weather events that strained already-overburdened power grids in California, Texas, and other key markets have created a significant opportunity for home power generation equipment manufacturers. Moreover, with the future potential to aggregate these distributed energy resources through the company’s grid services business, homeowners have the potential to monetize these assets. The stock declined during the quarter as the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance due largely to labor shortages in Generac’s dealer network which resulted in a slowdown in installations and implementations. As a consequence, dealers have reduced their on-site inventory. During the period, we exited our position in the company.”13. KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 336-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -34.95%KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) was another one of Jim Cramer's stocks that were ""about to pop"". He recommended the stock amid high interest rates, pointing out that its dividend yield is attractive. As of March 30, the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 6.47% and is trading at a PE multiple of 6x.KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) has underperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 34.95% over the past 6 months, as of March 30.KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) was held by 33 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022.

Of those, Diamond Hill Capital was the leading stockholder in the company and disclosed a stake worth $165.9 million.Renaissance Investment Management made the following comment about SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our position in SBA Communications Corporation(NASDAQ:SBAC) following a deterioration in fundamental factors. From a qualitative perspective, we were concerned about the company’s aggressive international expansion which increases currency risk, but, more importantly, signals a lack of investable growth in the U.S. market now that 5G wireless investments are slowing. We were also becoming increasingly worried about the impact that rising interest rates will have on SBA’s over-levered balance sheet.”11. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 516-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -20.40%Crown Castle International Corp.

(NYSE:CCI) underperformed due to higher interest rates and a slightly less constructive outlook for 2023. The company is seeing some pressure from non-renewals as a result of a merger between two major telecommunications companies.”10. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 1006-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -19.09%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) was among Cramer's top bank stock picks. He liked the major bank due to its ""massive deposit base"" and noted that it has ""tiny"" loan losses and ""gigantic"" credit balances. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) has lost 19.09% over the past 6 months, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), as of March 30.At the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 100 hedge funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and held collective stakes worth $37.5 billion in the company.

We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”9. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 616-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -17.48%Cramer was bullish on American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) and mentioned it among his top telecom stocks that were ""about to pop"".

The Strategy benefited from its underweight in the real estate sector with American Tower Corporation(NYSE:AMT) as its only holding. REITs are generally perceived to be interest rate sensitive, which negatively impacted American Tower’s recent stock performance. However, we remain confident in the company’s highly durable and predictable business model, which is supported by long-term customer contracts and insatiable wireless data growth.”8. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 236-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -16.49%One of Cramer's favorite REITs in October was Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA). He noted that the company's operations are in areas where ""housing is in short supply"" and so it would be ""stupid"" to sell the stock. Cramer thought Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) was ""about to pop"" but over the past 6 months, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) has underperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 16.49%, as of March 30.At the end of Q4 2022, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc (NYSE:MAA) was spotted on 23 investors' portfolios that disclosed stakes worth $323 million in the company.

(NYSE:MAA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:MAA) Communities is a REIT that owns, develops, acquires, and operates multi-family apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of the U.S. In recent quarters, its results have benefited from significant lease rate increases, but investors have begun to anticipate a deceleration as monetary policy takes aim at inflation.”7. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 256-Month Performance as of March 30 (Relative to SPY): -11.73%One of Cramer's top stock picks from October was Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK).

(NYSE:SWK) has lost 11.73% over the past 6 months, relative to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).25 hedge funds held stakes in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”While Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) has underperformed over the past 2 quarters, Cramer's picks that have outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past 6 months include ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).6. Domino's Pizza, Inc.

(NYSE:DPZ) was a part of 44 investors' portfolios that disclosed collective positions worth $1.46 billion in the company. Of those, Holocene Advisors was the top shareholder in the company and held a position worth $252 million.LRT Capital Management made the following comment about Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230406005157/en/Kendra Key joined Regions Bank as a Senior Vice President in the company’s Community Affairs division and will lead the Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative. (Photo: Business Wire)The Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative will be led by Kendra Key, who recently joined Regions as Senior Vice President in the bank’s Community Affairs division. Key will collaborate with community partners to leverage Regions’ resources and business development experience in ways that support and strengthen a vibrant Black-owned business ecosystem. The initiative will specifically aim to reach entrepreneurs throughout the Magic City, including and especially in underserved neighborhoods. Key and a network of organizations will work toward the following priorities:Identify and amplify current resources for Black entrepreneurs: Already, various organizations offer mentorship, technical assistance, or even funding to help new businesses go from concept to reality. The Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative will raise awareness of existing resources and evaluate opportunities for providing greater financial or technical support for programs with a proven track record of results. The impact over time will be greater opportunities for current and future business owners to receive customized guidance in launching and operating a successful business.Address gaps where additional resources are needed: Often, the difference between whether a business succeeds or fails comes down to access. Did the business owner have access to the right tools and training? Was there enough access to capital and liquidity? What are ways the existing business community can help address a lack of access and help more business owners thrive? These are foundational questions Key and community partners will consistently address as they identify ways to reach more people with tangible benefits.Build collaboration that focuses on results: While many organizations share in the goal of building a more prosperous Birmingham, it is important for these organizations to have strong awareness within the community and strong collaboration to ensure as many business owners as possible are benefiting. Key and community partners of Regions Bank will work extensively to ensure business accelerator programs, mentorship opportunities, technical assistance, co-working spaces, potential funding sources, and more are increasingly available to entrepreneurs to maximize their likelihood for success and growth.Story continues""Over the last several years, Regions Bank has focused its community engagement on fostering more inclusive prosperity, and one of the most powerful ways we can build on this commitment is by creating new strategies to support and uplift Black-owned businesses in our headquarters city,"" said John Turner, President and CEO of Regions Financial Corp. ""Regions is proud to be based in Birmingham, and we are deeply invested in our hometown. By enhancing our collaboration with community groups and focusing more of our time and resources on the growth of Black-owned businesses, we can address an important need in the Magic City while strengthening the quality of life for more entrepreneurs, families and neighborhoods.""Turner is a member of the Board of Directors of Prosper, an initiative created by corporate, civic and community leaders to build the most inclusive and thriving economy in the Southeast. The Birmingham Black-Owned Business Initiative is a shared priority for Regions and Prosper and is designed to work with a range of organizations that are all united in the goal of helping more Black-owned businesses thrive.A recent Brookings Institution study reported the Birmingham region has the lowest rate among all large U.S. metro areas (53rd out of 53) for Black business ownership of companies that are large enough to have employees in addition to their owner. But many areas of the country are seeing an increase in Black entrepreneurship. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Black neighborhoods with moderate income levels experienced a large uptick in new business startups between 2019 and 2020. Key and community groups are focused on ensuring Birmingham builds a positive trajectory through collaboration and innovation to support more business owners.""We have an entrepreneurial spirit, enthusiastic community partners, and higher engagement from the existing business community that recognizes the importance of a stronger Black-owned business climate,"" Key said. ""I’m excited about this initiative, which is a pivotal step toward a long-term goal at Regions to make a meaningful difference in addressing the plight of Black businesses in Birmingham while helping create a best-in-class Black business ecosystem.""Key reports to Leroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs for Regions Bank and president of the Regions Foundation. Key’s work will also complement the work of the Regions Community Development Corporation, which was established under Abrahams’ leadership.""The deeper collaboration Kendra is building today will create a more prosperous tomorrow,"" Abrahams said. ""We are deeply grateful for community partners like Prosper and others that share a strong vision for fostering more Black-owned business success. Financial inclusion is crucial to the success of the communities where we live and work, and we know Kendra’s experience and passion will drive tangible results in neighborhoods across Birmingham.""""Prosper is committed to working with leading businesses, including Regions, and a wide range of community partners to empower more people with crucial resources for business success,"" added Prosper President J.W. Carpenter. ""We saw through the pilot launch of Prosper’s Magic City Match program that Black-owned businesses are ready to grow, compete and succeed in the marketplace. We appreciate the leadership position Regions is taking and cannot think of a better person than Kendra to lead this work. As a Prosper Board member, Kendra has already had a tremendous influence on Prosper’s work, and this has the potential to make a generational impact for entrepreneurs and families across our city. We are excited to partner with her and with Regions.""Before joining Regions, Key served as head of Minority Depository Institution Engagement for Citigroup. Prior to Citigroup, Key served as senior vice president of community and economic development and market leader for Hope Enterprise Corporation. She was also an associate attorney at Maynard Cooper &amp; Gale. Her legal and financial experience has focused on community development initiatives including tax credit financing, opportunity zones, real estate and commercial banking.Key earned a juris doctor at Vanderbilt University Law School and a bachelor of arts in Political Science at the University of Alabama, where she was a Truman Scholar and Blackburn Institute Fellow.Key is a member of the Board of Advisors for both the Vanderbilt University Law School and the University of Alabama Division of Community Affairs.

261,e7fc5b25-003b-3136-a059-3bdd2e938f87,VZ,2023-04-08,Verizon continues to upgrade Denver's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-denvers-best-130000718.html,1680786000,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show Verizon customers have the best network experience in DenverDENVER, April 06, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Denver, CO. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Denver include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Verizon engineers have been aggressively deploying 5G Ultra Wideband throughout Denver, deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service on more than 200 cell sites. Network coverage has also been expanded recently with the addition of four new macro cell sites and a dozen small cell sites which provide 4G and 5G Ultra Wideband service using both Verizon’s C-band coverage layer spectrum and Millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum, its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.  Service covers communities including the Denver metropolitan area, from Castle Rock on the south side, throughout Denver, and extending into Boulder and Longmont to the North.Denver’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Until this year in Denver, Verizon currently uses 100 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Denver will be able to take advantage of additional C-band spectrum, significantly increasing the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Denver. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Denver area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“Today’s world calls for faster speeds, ultra secure connections and improved coverage in more places. We’re dedicated to bringing the best and latest technologies to local communities, and to keeping our customers connected through 5G,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers, the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Denver, CO customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers and visitors to Denver, CO having the best experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Denver, Verizon wins for overall network performance, and in fact is unbeaten in every single category tested including accessibility, reliability, speed and performance in texts and calls.  Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Denver with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 235%, median upload speeds increasing 38% since last year* in the market and peak speeds of up to 481 Mbps. In fact, Verizon’s network achieved an overall network performance score of 99.7 out of 100 - the highest score in Denver for any carrier in the history of RootMetrics’ testing.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Denver, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect.2022 was one of the worst years for the stock market due to high inflation and rising interest rates. In October 2022, Mad Money's Jim Cramer spotted 14 potential buying opportunities among 59 stocks that made new lows. Cramer said at the time that these 14 stocks were ""about to pop"". Let's see which one of these have actually popped since then, but before that, let's look at how Cramer feels about the market situation right now.The Way to ""Whip Inflation Now"", According to CramerOn March 28, Jim Cramer spoke about the current inflation situation and the Fed. Jim Cramer noted that that while the Fed wants to tame inflation, it does not want to go as far as causing further bank failures, and so the Fed decided to go with a quarter-point rate hike instead of a half-point rate hike due to the recent banking crisis. Jim Cramer thinks that the Fed needs to stop raising interest rates further, however, it cannot unless ""wage inflation cools dramatically"". According to Cramer, there are two ways that the Fed can ""whip inflation now"". One way is that the Fed keeps raising interest rates, causing wage stagnation and hurting the housing and automotive sectors along with the overall economy. The other riskier way to get wage inflation in control is to create ""financial panic"". Here are some comments from Jim Cramer:""I think this bank crisis, or jam, if left to its own devices is equal to about 100 basis points of tightening, if it continues like this. A big bank failure is incredibly deflationary, it's perhaps the most deflationary thing that could happen to an entire economy. It's more shocking than endless rate hikes, but it gets the darn process over with, even with collateral damage that tends to be a lot worse. No I don't want it to be this way, believe me. This is a bad way to beat inflation, but it will definitely do the job.""Story continuesCramer thinks that the risk of further banking failures is not over yet. He also pointed out that as long as small banks continue to suffer from contagion risks, the Fed will need to continue raising interest rates. Cramer said that the only way the Fed's tightening cycle will end is if and when a large bank fails.As of March 30, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) has gained 10.12% over the past 6 months. Some of Cramer's ""about to pop"" stocks that have outperformed the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) include ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Yum! Brands, Inc.

(NYSE:GNRC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), is a manufacturer of power generation equipment with a leading position in home standby generators. Generac also offers consumers a home energy management system that harnesses and stores power from the sun to be used for backup during utility power outages. Severe weather events that strained already-overburdened power grids in California, Texas, and other key markets have created a significant opportunity for home power generation equipment manufacturers. Moreover, with the future potential to aggregate these distributed energy resources through the company’s grid services business, homeowners have the potential to monetize these assets. The stock declined during the quarter as the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance due largely to labor shortages in Generac’s dealer network which resulted in a slowdown in installations and implementations. As a consequence, dealers have reduced their on-site inventory. During the period, we exited our position in the company.”13.

We were also becoming increasingly worried about the impact that rising interest rates will have on SBA’s over-levered balance sheet.”11. Crown Castle International Corp.

The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry.

(NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect. Suggested articles:12 Cheap Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds14 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to BuyStarter Stock Portfolio: 15 Safe Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 14 Stocks ""About To Pop"" According To Jim Cramer: In Retrospect is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

266,5c627a62-e047-334d-a9e6-e9eb2633ed0a,NVDA,2023-04-08,How to invest in the A.I. boom: 11 stocks and 4 funds to buy now,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-boom-11-stocks-4-154500787.html,1680882300,STORY,"['INTC', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL']","[When it comes to A.I., investors have a torturous choice to make: Believe the hype and jump in headfirst, or ignore the hype and potentially miss out on a once-in-a-generation tech transformation. “It’s the early days in terms of picking winners and losers” of the A.I. boom, explained Scott Helfstein, head of thematic solutions at Global X ETFs. “We’re not sure yet of the different ways that we’re going to be able to monetize this technology. Some are obvious, and some are not obvious—and it might be that the ones that are not obvious become more important over time,” he said. According to analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers, A.I. could add up to $15.7 trillion in global GDP in 2030, which is more than the current output from India and China combined.But experts caution that investing in generative A.I. is far more nuanced than just buying Big Tech stocks that have integrated the technology. “This could be another one of those moments where we’re getting to the peak of the hype cycle, so companies are going to spend the money, but they’re going to find it’s a lot harder to build something truly compelling,” explained Peter Cohan, business professor at Babson College. “Microsoft has a big investment in OpenAI, and they also have GitHub, which has a lot of the software that can be used for developing A.I., yet I still don’t know if that’s going to generate enough revenue for Microsoft for A.I. itself to become a significant part of its business,” he noted.But it’s impossible to ignore that in an era of high inflation and subpar index returns, companies and funds that focus on A.I. and machine learning have strong growth potential. For example, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which tracks 44 holdings of companies involved with industrial robotics and automation, nonindustrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, is up 18% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 is just up 7%. For investors who want to get in on this burgeoning area, here are the smartest ways to approach investing in A.I.Story continuesBig TechA plethora of companies across sectors are integrating A.I. into their operations, from Land O’Lakes to Microsoft to cybersecurity firm SentinelOne. So you may already be indirectly investing in A.I. Big Tech is leading the charge from both investment and innovation standpoints. “A.I. is being defined actively by leading tech giants,” explained PitchBook tech analyst Brendan Burke, citing the leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). “Those companies have the research labs and the operational tools to bring basic innovations in A.I. algorithms to market,” he said.If you want to bet on Big Tech, Microsoft has forged ahead the furthest with its $10 billion investment in OpenAI and the subsequent rollout of revamped search service Bing with new A.I.-powered search features. While Bing’s features have debuted with some bizarre and disturbing interactions with users, if the technology does successfully upend Google’s search, Microsoft has a huge market share to gain. “We believe incorporating ChatGPT capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance,” wrote D.A. Davidson software analyst Gil Luria in a recent research note. Luria increased Microsoft’s price target from $270 to $325 and gave the firm a buy rating. “While Google has announced a project to add [generative] A.I. to Google Search, we believe Bing’s head start could create a permanent share shift,” Luria wrote. Yet with the speed bumps in the rollout of Bing, it is clear that generative A.I. chatbots still have a long way to go.Chart shows AI-focused fund performances y-t-dBank of America analysts, on the other hand, wrote in a recent report that Meta’s stock has the most to gain from A.I. implementation, citing the company’s incorporation of A.I. into its Reels video feature. “We expect an outsized impact from the adoption of A.I. given rich consumer data sets and massive ramp-up in A.I. investments, led by Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon,” the report detailed. Bank of America gave Alphabet and Amazon buy ratings in its forward-looking 2023 report.Comparing the A.I. boom to the dotcom boom of the early 2000s, it is clear that if you pick the right companies you can still make out very well. “Even if you bought Amazon at the height of the dotcom boom, you still would have made a lot of money,” said Tom Taulli, a startup advisor and A.I. author.But the giants have a problem—they’re huge. “It’s harder to move the needle for [Big Tech] as opposed to some of these smaller or midsize companies that are going to wind up playing in space that is going to be significant,” Helfstein said. “Maybe they won’t be as recognizable, but they have better growth potential, which can turn into investment returns,” explained Helfstein.The “picks and shovels” of the A.I. boomDuring the California gold rush, some of the savviest investors eschewed chasing gold itself and made a mint investing in the picks and shovels that those looking for riches needed for their search. Cohan sees an analogy in A.I. “It might well be that the initial beneficiaries of A.I. expansion are going to be in the hardware space, instead of the software space,” Helfstein predicted.So what “picks” do experts recommend? PitchBook’s Burke explained: “A.I. growth is based on the improved efficiency and the decreased cost of [graphics] processing units (GPUs). The most basic enabler for these new models is the latest hardware innovations coming from chip giants such as Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA).” Semiconductors are necessary for A.I. software to function, and the companies that produce them will supercharge its expansion.Nvidia is currently the leading chip producer in the A.I. space. “A lot of capital is going to go into these generative A.I. startups,” said Cohan. “And the question for investors is: What technology will they be using to build their APIs? The answer is that they’re very likely to be using Nvidia chips.” “It’s the early days in terms of picking winners and losers.”Scott Helfstein, head of thematic solutions at Global X ETFsBeyond chips, there is software infrastructure to support the huge volume of data that the A.I. explosion will rely on. “The next layer up, there’s a need for enterprises to integrate their data into centralized data warehouses to improve the performance of their A.I. models,” Burke explained. “That’s where database management vendors, such as Snowflake (SNOW) and Alteryx (AYX) can help enterprises,” he said. Zacks gives both companies buy ratings.Dynatrace (DT) is another cloud-computing infrastructure firm that could have upside. The company operates a software intelligence platform that uses A.I. and automation. Bank of America thinks the stock, which is up 1% year to date, has further to run, giving it a buy rating.Another winner could be Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which is projected to increase its market share and revenue as one of its biggest clients, the U.S. government, expands its military A.I. implementation. In October 2022, the company signed an $85 million contract with the U.S. Army Materiel Command to use its software to increase military A.I. capabilities. The company was founded in 2003 by a group of VCs including Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp. While the stock is up 31% year to date, analysts (like those at BofA who have a “buy” rating on the stock) expect it can further capitalize on the A.I. boom.A.I.-focused fundsThough A.I. technology has had a breakthrough year, there are already a robust number of funds and ETFs that give you exposure to the sector, which is a win for investors. “With these emerging technologies, people are better off playing a basket of companies, rather than putting their chips in a single one,” said Helfstein. He drew a comparison to Tesla in the electric vehicle industry. While Tesla was first out of the gate to dominate the EV market, competitors are now lining up to surpass the reigning EV king: “I don’t think we’re gonna live in a world that’s dominated by a single A.I.—it’s going to be a competitive market.” Not to mention the inherent unpredictability of an industry evolving at warp speed. “This can be a volatile space; you never know what could happen tomorrow, so diversification is important,” explained Taulli.A solid option is the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which is up 18% year to date and has $1.64 billion in assets under management. Its top holdings include Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical, Upstart Holdings (UPST), Keyence (KYCCF), and ABB (ABB).BlackRock’s iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO) is another option, which has 118 holdings and around $288 million in assets under management. Year to date, the fund is up 15%, solidly outpacing the S&amp;P 500.A widely diversified option is the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which holds 79 stocks with the top five holdings representing just 9% of the fund’s value. Year to date, the ETF is up 12%.The Defiance Machine Learning and Quantum Computing ETF (QTUM) has roughly $116 million in assets under management, and its top holdings include Nvidia and Alteryx. Year to date, its return is roughly 16%, and the fund received a five-star rating from Morningstar Research in December 2022.Overall, experts advise caution—and patience—when it comes to investing in generative A.I. “Investors should keep in mind that breakthroughs tend to be nonlinear,” explained Helfstein. Having just seen a period of what he calls “exponential innovation,” don’t be shocked if now we “level off for a little bit” before the next surge.A version of this article appears in the April/May 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “Buying the A.I. boom.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresThe young creators of a ""TED meets Burning Man"" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the insurance sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The insurance industry in the US can be divided into several categories, including life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty insurance, and reinsurance. In 2022, the global annual insurance premiums exceeded $7 trillion and the sector is likely to experience a CAGR of 8.5% through 2028. Over the last few years, the insurance sector has shown resilience and adaptability in the face of various social and geopolitical events. However, other several ongoing factors currently contribute to the expanding protection gap, including natural catastrophes, cyber risks, and a net-zero economy. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the protection gap totaled over $1.4 trillion in 2021 and is expected to widen in the coming years as well.The recent data breaches and cyber attacks have increased the importance of cyber insurance among individuals and institutions. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, cyber economic losses reached $945 billion in 2020, over 100 times the total premium market, which stood at $9 billion in 2021. The report also mentioned that two-thirds of companies in a survey by McAfee reported some kind of cyber incident in 2019. Due to these reasons, US insurance companies are deploying digital technologies for customer satisfaction. In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are massively preferred by US insurers, which first came to prominence during the pandemic of 2020 when major organizations adopted work-from-home policies. Bloomberg cited data by Allied Market Research, which revealed that AI in the insurance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 32.5% by 2031, reaching $45.7 billion globally.The growing role of AI in the insurance market is also covered in one of our articles, titled 10 Hot Insurance Stocks To Buy Now. This report also highlighted a positive outlook for the sector this year as many individuals around the world started paying attention to their retirement and health-related plans. The returns of the insurance industry also showed a steady performance of the sector over the past 12 months. The S&amp;P Insurance Select Industry Index fell by 5.37% in the past year, compared with a 9.61% decline in the S&amp;P 500.

277,0321f505-3207-3175-a219-22d0fefb14aa,APD,2023-04-08,7 Hydrogen Stocks Sitting in the Sweet Spot,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-hydrogen-stocks-sitting-sweet-180704731.html,1680545224,STORY,"['GS', 'BE', 'PLUG', 'FCEL', 'APD']","[Hydrogen could be one of the most explosive opportunities. After all, it emits no greenhouse gas, and the only waste product is vapor. And it could create a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for long-term hydrogen investors. Even better, Goldman Sachs, for example, says the market for hydrogen production could reach $1 trillion by 2050. To reach net-zero emissions, the firm says about $5 trillion will need to be invested in the hydrogen supply chain. Along the way, it could lead to a massive opportunity for some of the top hydrogen stocks to buy.With the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. is set to be “positioned to be one of the lowest green hydrogen production cost regions in the world, at $0.5 to $1.5 per kg of green hydrogen, which is going to substantially boost the demand in the U.S., potentially growing to ~30 MTPA by 2030 to 35, setting a precedent for other countries to follow,” as noted by EY.com.In addition, according to the International Energy Agency, global hydrogen demand will need to double from about 94Mt in 2021 to more than 180 by 2030. Europe may need to see a six-fold increase in demand by 2050. So, it’s no surprise that some analysts foresee a multi-trillion-dollar hydrogen opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat being said, it’s a good idea to load up on hydrogen stocks for the long term.Hydrogen Stocks to Buy: Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (HDRO)An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue skySource: Audio und werbung / ShutterstockOne of the best ways to diversify with top hydrogen stocks to buy is with an ETF, such as the oversold Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEARCA:HDRO) – which currently sits at strong support.Not only does this ETF offer a good deal of exposure to hydrogen stocks, but it does so at an impressively lower cost. For example, the HDRO ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.30%, trades at around $10 a share. With this ETF, investors gain exposure to stocks such as Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE), Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP), Fuel Cell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL), and dozens more.Story continuesTo be included in this ETF, a company must generate 50% of its revenue from hydrogen and/or a fuel cell project, or be involved in developing fuel cells or hydrogen sources, according to Defiance ETFs.Hydrogen Stocks to Buy: Direxion Hydrogen ETF (HJEN)An image of a hydrogen fuel pipeline running through a grassy field, with wind turbines and solar panels in the backgroundSource: petrmalinak / ShutterstockAnother one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy is the Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSEARCA:HJEN). Not only does it give investors exposure to top hydrogen stocks, but it also does so at below $15 per share.With an expense ratio of 0.45%, this ETF holds 30 companies that are in the following sectors: Hydrogen production and generation, storage and supply, fuel cells and battery, and systems and solutions. Some of the ETF’s top holdings include Plug Power, Bloom Energy, Ballard Power, Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NASDAQ:APD), and Doosan Fuel Cell Co.Plus, after a recent pullback with the broader market, the ETF appears to have caught strong support around $13.75. From here, I’d like to see it run back to $15.50 initially.Hydrogen Stocks to Buy: Global X Hydrogen ETF (HYDR)Hydrogen renewable energy production - hydrogen gas for clean electricity solar and wind turbine facility.Source: Audio und werbung / ShutterstockLet’s toss in one more ETF for good measure. After all, I’m a big fan of ETFs, especially when it comes to a sector as potentially explosive as hydrogen. With an expense ratio of 0.50%, the Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ:HYDR) is also excessively oversold at the moment and is another solid fit among top hydrogen stocks to buy.This one, in particular, invests in companies involved in hydrogen production; the integration of hydrogen into energy systems; and the development/manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cells and electrolyzers, including Bloom Energy, Plug Power, Ballard Power, and Ceres Power (OTCMKTS:CPWHF).Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals is another one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy. The company owns and operates more than 100 hydrogen plants around the world. It’s also involved in more than 250 hydrogen-fueling projects all over the world. Most recently, it announced plans, in partnership with AES, to invest $4 billion in its first huge green hydrogen facility, which will be located in Texas. It also just received over $130 million in NASA contracts to provide liquid hydrogen for several NASA locations.Even better, the company increased its quarterly dividend from $1.62 to $1.75 per share—representing an 8% increase. This marks the 41st consecutive year that Air Products has increased its dividend payment. The dividend is payable on May 8, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 3, 2023.Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comAnother hot trade on the hydrogen boom is Linde (NYSE:LIN). Its Niagara Falls plant, scheduled to open in 2025, will use carbon-free hydroelectric power to make hydrogen. In fact, according to Barron’s, “Hydrogen now represents less than 10% of Linde’s sales, but analysts see it growing in importance as the company invests in projects worth tens of billions of dollars.”The company also said it was allocated $33 billion to clean energy investments, most of which will be hydrogen-related. Plus, BMO Capital Markets says investors should use any weakness in LIN as a buying opportunity. They also see “upside potential beyond our $370 target price.”Earnings have been just as impressive. For 2022, it posted an adjusted operating profit of $7.9 billion, up 10% year over year. Income jumped 11% to $6.2 billion, with sales up 8% to $33.3 billion. It also believes it’s on track for a record year in 2023.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockAnother top hydrogen stock is Bloom Energy, which manufactures solid oxide fuel cells. Bloom’s fuel cells are being used by retailers, healthcare centers, and auto manufacturers.Earnings have been strong. While its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $47.17 million, or 23 cents a share, from a loss of $33.32 million, or 19 cents a share, year over year, its adjusted was 27 cents, which was ahead of estimates for nine cents. Revenue jumped to $462.5 million from $342.4 million, year over year. That was also ahead of expectations for $398.7 million. Looking ahead, Bloom Energy said it expects 2023 revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, as compared to analyst expectations for $1.48 billion.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power, like many of its peers, was beaten up over the last year. However, as the hydrogen market explodes, this is one of the top stocks to own – especially with its current deals with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Boeing (NYSE:BA), and FedEx (NYSE:FDX),to name a few.Plug also announced it expanded its GenKey offering to enable fuel cell adoption for warehouses that operate less than 100 electric forklifts. “For the first time, this segment of the forklift market, representing more than 25% of all forklifts sold in the U.S., will have access to cost-effective hydrogen fuel cells and the increased productivity they unlock,” says the release.It also announced the historic flight of a regional airliner powered by the company’s line of ProGen fuel cells. The plug also popped on news that Nikola and Chart Industries announced an agreement regarding hydrogen storage. That was beneficial to Plug because it suggests the hydrogen market is gaining momentum.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

280,ff16a29c-dce9-3f88-b5ea-cd54c6cebc45,FOX,2023-04-08,Investors in Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) have made a favorable return of 34% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-fox-nasdaq-foxa-made-124450227.html,1680871490,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) share price is up 29% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Disappointingly, the share price is down 13% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fox While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last three years, Fox failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 0.6% (annualized).Based on these numbers, we think that the decline in earnings per share may not be a good representation of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The modest 1.5% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. It may well be that Fox revenue growth rate of 6.4% over three years has convinced shareholders to believe in a brighter future. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Fox will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Fox the TSR over the last 3 years was 34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveFox shareholders are down 12% for the year (even including dividends), falling short of the market return. Meanwhile, the broader market slid about 9.6%, likely weighing on the stock. Investors are up over three years, booking 10% per year, much better than the more recent returns. Sometimes when a good quality long term winner has a weak period, it's turns out to be an opportunity, but you really need to be sure that the quality is there. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Fox (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

282,00cca6fe-c701-3377-9fde-7e26fe97cd50,CHRW,2023-04-08,3 Transport-Services Stocks to Watch in a Challenging Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-transport-services-stocks-watch-134001910.html,1680788401,STORY,"['CHRW', 'SNDR', '^GSPC']","[The U.S. equity markets continue to be affected by extreme volatility. With inflation woes far from over, economic uncertainty is rampant.  High operating costs and supply-chain woes, too, act as major deterrents. All these factors are denting the prospects of stocks in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three industry players, namely Expeditors International of Washington EXPD, C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Schneider National SNDR, which are better positioned to brave multiple industry challenges.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping. The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation. Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustryEconomic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices in March, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The recent turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Story continuesSupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; High Costs: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Increased operating costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. The industry players are distressed by rising logistic expenses. The labor market has struggled with the limited availability of labor, which is driving-related expenses. Costs will likely continue to be steep due to supply-chain troubles.Strong Financial Returns for Shareholders: With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more and more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile by way of dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in business. Among the Transportation - Services industry players, Schneider National announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend in February.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 26-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 24% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate for 2023 has decreased 25.1% on a year-over-year basis.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Surpasses S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Transportation-Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 2.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 9.3% and the broader sector’s decline of 7.6%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.72X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.57X. The value is, however, higher than the sector's trailing 12-month P/S of 1.54X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.33X, as low as 1.41X and at the median of 1.94X.Price-to-Sales Ratio (F12M)3 Transport Services Stocks to WatchExpeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This Seattle, WA-based freight forwarder is being bolstered by strong air freight revenues. Efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable as well.Expeditors has an impressive earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark on the other occasion), the average beat being 5.69%. The stock has witnessed a 0.2% upward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings over the past 30 days.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  Price and Consensus: EXPD C.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, operates as an asset-light logistics player. Efforts to control costs bode well for this freight broker. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock.C.H. Robinson surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining ones), the average surprise being 7.64%.Price and Consensus: CHRW Schneider National, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, is being aided by strong performances in the Truckload and Intermodal segments. The Truckload segment is benefiting from Midwest Logistics Systems’ revenues, effective yield management and dedicated new business growth.The Intermodal unit is being aided by a rise in revenue per order and brokerage volume growth. Efforts to reward its shareholders are commendable as well. SNDR’s sound liquidity position is an added positive. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has moved 0.9% north. Price and Consensus: SNDRWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Dave Wehrkamp, the plant's former Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) leader, says the plant is always looking for ways to improve its sustainability efforts by asking questions like, ""What items in the facility are top energy users?"" or ""How can we reduce the impact of machinery while maintaining efficiency?""Over the years, the Columbus Engine Plant (CEP) has become home to the manufacturing, research and development of multiple Cummins Inc products. From battery packs and electric driveline components to heavy-duty machining of heads and blocks for the X15 engine, the plant tackles it all. It's become home to the Light Duty Tech Center (LDTC) for research and development for light, medium and heavy-duty engines, Cummins Inc.

The climbdown by Brussels, which followed intense lobbying from German and Italian carmakers, has prompted calls for Britain to follow suit.Story continuesIt came as Elon Musk said that it would cost $14 trillion to convert the world entirely to green energy. The billionaire's electric car company Tesla also suggested it was developing a compact car, van and bus in a paper dubbed Master Plan Part 3.Lord Bamford has donated significant sums to the Conservative Party and Mr Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson over the years.More recently he has become a leading advocate for the development of hydrogen as a green energy source alongside his son Jo, who owns Boris bus manufacturer Wrightbus.JCB has invested £100m in new hydrogen engines to go in the digger company’s machines.Lord Bamford added: “The UK Government needs to be more open-minded and supportive of the hydrogen economy, and of hydrogen combustion technology in particular. Recent comments from the Department for Transport and Department for Business and Trade suggest a lack of interest and understanding.”The JCB chairman’s criticism comes just days after urging ministers to rethink a net zero ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles.Insisting that “the internal combustion engine certainly has a future”, he said the UK should follow the lead of the EU which water down restrictions by allowing the sale of internal combustion engines as long as they burn carbon-neutral petrol alternatives known as e-fuels.The UK stood by its decision for a blanket ban from 2030 despite the EU’s decision during its “Green Day” last month.Critics of the Government's net zero plans seized on the European Union's decision as evidence that a total policy rethink is needed. Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace have said that it could slow down electric vehicle adoption.British carmakers Aston Martin and McLaren are already understood to be examining e-fuels as an option for powering future models.Lord Bamford said: “Governments should be wary of outlawing engines, when the root cause of the problem is the fossil fuels we currently put in the fuel tank.”]"

(OKE) closed the most recent trading day at $65.69, moving -0.45% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.36%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.01%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.91%.Coming into today, shares of the natural gas company had lost 1.64% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 2.56%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.24%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Oneok Inc. as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 2, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.81, up 108.05% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.56 billion, up 2.13% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.40 per share and revenue of $22.3 billion, which would represent changes of +40.63% and -0.37%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oneok Inc. should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.06% higher within the past month.

With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Colgate-Palmolive. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Colgate-Palmolive. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 6.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$61m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Colgate-Palmolive .If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Philip Morris (PM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on April 20, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.39 a share.PM has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.83%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.39 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.PM is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Colgate-Palmolive (CL).Slated to report earnings on May 5, 2023, Colgate-Palmolive holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.71 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate-Palmolive is $0.70, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.98%.Story continuesPM and CL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It was the first instance where 5G network slicing was implemented in Taiwan. It ensured high-performance live streaming with rapid data transmission in real time. Ericsson’s network slicing technology provided greater flexibility to FET, enabling full optimization of the latter’s existing base station to ensure optimum competition coverage and premium experience for the viewers.5G network slicing brings many opportunities with efficient resource utilization. Demand for network connectivity differs depending on factors such as location, devices and user preferences. Airplane communication systems, home networks, vehicle navigation and online sports streaming all have different connectivity requirements. Ericsson’s network slicing technology with 5G standalone architecture allows multiple virtual network creations based upon a shared physical network infrastructure. This enables operators to optimize bandwidth connectivity and adjust latency and security according to consumer’s needs.  More than 11,000 runners and 300 competitors from 33 countries participated in the WJS Marathon, certified as a ""Gold Label” by World Athletics. The successful implementation of Ericsson’s technology in such a high-profile event accentuates the strength of the company’s innovation and will likely lead to further commercial expansion.Ericsson is witnessing solid demand trends for its 4G and 5G RAN technology that  emphasize the strength of its Radio System portfolio and acceptance of its latest innovation among customers. The company is benefiting from solid 5G momentum worldwide. Investments in research and development (R&amp;D) have established it as a leader in 5G. In the Mobile Networks business, Ericsson plans to capitalize on the convergence of cloud, software and services by merging Digital Services and Managed Services to form a new segment dubbed Cloud Software and Services.With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has recently increased. To maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is a need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity.The company is focused on structural changes that will generate lasting efficiency gains and boost cost competitiveness.

That's the studio behind the new ""Super Mario Brothers Movie,"" in theaters nationwide today.[DRAMATIC MUSIC]- There's a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies. They're all counting on us.- Mario!- No pressure.DAVE BRIGGS: Man, I think it looks really good. Mario, Princess Peach, and company teaming up, though, with beloved sauce brand Truff to drop a limited edition collectible pack of its truffle-infused hot sauces. The pack features Truff's three best selling sauces in this exclusive Mushroom Kingdom VIP gift box.These things are selling like hotcakes. They've become incredibly popular. I want you guys to try. I will tell you, it is hot, hotter, and then white truffle infused. So let's start from the right, and then we're going to go--SEANA SMITH: Have you this yet?DAVE BRIGGS: I have not tried it yet. My kids--JOSH SCHAFER: Oh, he's just facilitating this time.DAVE BRIGGS: I will try it. I will try it. But my kids are obsessed with this Truff sauce. They have a lot of partnerships. They have one with Costco. You can get it there.SEANA SMITH: Oh, that's good.DAVE BRIGGS: It's doing so extraordinarily well. Hot sauce combined with truffle, right, two of the real popular things in this country.I should mention, the Comcast stock, by the way, is down, fractionally though, up 6% this year. Why is it down? It may have more to do with a note here from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. They sold their Comcast shares, citing a company with ""no clear catalyst.""I'm going to try it. What do you guys think?SEANA SMITH: It's very hot, but I think it makes so much sense for this company. You're right, this sauce really has a cult-like following, almost. I would say they capitalize on a lot of these types of promotional activities. And this makes so much sense. It really is tapping nostalgia, with so many people out there who are excited for this, in terms of the-- it's too hot for me.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: It's really hot.SEANA SMITH: It's really hot. That's the extra hot one.JOSH SCHAFER: I think it's good.SEANA SMITH: And that's a lot of sauce.DAVE BRIGGS: That's the hottest one in the middle?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I only had the middle one, the hottest one.SEANA SMITH: If you told me the right thing.JOSH SCHAFER: I thought it was good.DAVE BRIGGS: It's delightful.JOSH SCHAFER: I think it really does build on, too, what we talk about all the times, when once you get these universes, having a movie, building products out of it, it makes sense, right. You could see Mario lovers maybe even getting one of those and not opening it.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: It's got a fun cover on it.SEANA SMITH: I got a question, though. How many people are really going to go and see this? You said you loved the trailer. Would you go and see it in theaters?DAVE BRIGGS: Well, you know what I'm going to see in theaters, ""Air.""SEANA SMITH: ""Barbie?""DAVE BRIGGS: ""Air,"" which we will talk about later on. That movie, I'm really excited for. I think it's probably a younger demographic than the 46-year-old.JOSH SCHAFER: To me, I think it is more appealing the other way, where you have a movie and then build a video game off of it. I always liked playing those games growing up, like a Harry Potter video game or the Star Wars LEGOs that they came out with. I loved that series and it worked for me that way. I don't know if it works when you go video game to movie as much for me. I should note, I wasn't that big of a gamer growing up, but I just casually played video games. So I think it's more probably for that hardcore Nintendo-style audience.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. I grew up on Super Mario Brothers. The one, the hotter is the one closest to me.SEANA SMITH: You're starting to sweat a little bit.DAVE BRIGGS: It is on fire. I prefer the white truffle infused.JOSH SCHAFER: The truffle. The truffle is the best tasting one.SEANA SMITH: Smart move by them.]"

(NYSE:PRU) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial Prudential Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of International Businesses &amp; PGIM, Andrew Sullivan, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$101 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$83.36). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Prudential Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Prudential Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Prudential Financial. In total, Executive VP and Head of International Businesses &amp; PGIM Andrew Sullivan sold US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Prudential Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Prudential Financial insiders own about US$53m worth of shares. That equates to 0.2% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Prudential Financial Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Prudential Financial and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.1% increase in share prices after a year of 5.0% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Devon Energy. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Devon Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Devon Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Devon Energy Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$249m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Devon Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Devon Energy is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit concerning...If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Seamless Exchange retrieves, aggregates, and deduplicates health data from multiple sources to create a more comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) of a patient's medical history, even if treatment was received from multiple providers. With this comprehensive view, MU Health Care's physicians and nurses can see a patient's health history, medications, and other vital information they need to determine the best course of care.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""In the clinics where we've launched Oracle Health Seamless Exchange, we've seen the benefits of its data deduplication capabilities firsthand and gained reconciliation efficiencies quickly. It is simplifying the ingestion of critical external health data,"" said Robert Pierce, MD, medical director for Clinical Decision Support, MU Health Care. ""Now, with external patient data more consistently integrated into the local chart, our clinicians can make care decisions more confidently, considering all relevant factors so patients receive more consistent and better care.""Creating a single medical record across systems to improve carePatients commonly receive medical treatment across multiple facilities, providers, and health systems. This leaves their critical health data stored in disparate, disconnected systems, which can make it challenging for clinicians to have access to a complete view of a patient's health history to inform care decisions.Oracle Health Seamless Exchange combines health data from multiple healthcare facilities, including from most EHRs and other outside sources, to create a more comprehensive, clearer view of a patient's care history. Seamless Exchange automatically reconciles new data against existing data to eliminate redundant information and manual data management. This cleansed data can then be accessed directly in the clinician's workflow without the need to search through multiple sources to find critical information, which not only improves care quality but also supports patient safety.Story continues""Transforming, organizing, and understanding data is critical to helping physicians, individuals, and communities get the information they need to improve healthcare,"" said Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability, Oracle Health. ""With Seamless Exchange, we are taking data exchange beyond connectivity to true usability. This is a big step forward for the industry. Not only does it immediately ease the administrative burden on clinicians, it sets the stage for a more connected and open healthcare ecosystem that will deliver better outcomes for patients and providers while making global health systems more useable and equitable.""Today, hundreds of millions of outside data records have been exchanged and aggregated using Seamless Exchange. MU Health Care is currently using Seamless Exchange at two of its ambulatory clinics, Fulton Family Health Associates and Family Medicine – Mexico, and is planning to expand its deployment across its health system this year.To see Seamless Exchange in action, visit booth #921 at the 2023 HIMSS Global Health Conference in Chicago, April 17-21, 2023. Oracle is also sponsoring the Interoperability Showcase, which demonstrates the value of interoperability for connecting health and care, with related solutions featured in booth #7946.About University of Missouri Health CareUniversity of Missouri Health Care is an academic health system with a mission to save and improve lives.

Or so investors hope.This week brought a host of misses on closely watched economic data — from the ADP employment report and ISM manufacturing data to JOLTs (the job openings report). Sure, with a 236,000 increase in March, the non-farm payrolls beat estimates slightly. But the figure was below the year-to-date average increase of 344,000 — so it also sort of tapped into the gloomier data mood.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The subsequent vibe on Wall Street is that the economy may be hitting a soft patch after the March banking turmoil and after yet another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.""Risk-off sentiment has continued to grow in markets thanks to another round of weak data that’s added to fears about a potential U.S. recession,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid warned.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) all saw buyer's fatigue in the wake of the data letdowns.What didn't lack interest? Safe-haven trades such as gold, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund. Oddly enough, speculative AI names like BigBear.ai (BBAI) and SoundHound (SOUN) caught bids (here's what pros told me about this move).Amid all this activity, here are three things you may have missed this week.1. The New York Auto Show is in townWith the auto show in town, Yahoo Finance was working the scene all week to report on the latest and greatest in everything mobility.GM's (GM) CFO Paul Jacobson told me over lunch that there are no plans to turn a car's cockpit into one giant subscription service. That's reassuring considering some automakers have pondered charging subscriptions for heated seats.Story continuesThe interior of the Chrysler Airflow concept is displayed at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023.

Shout out to our friends at our sister publication Autoblog — I really enjoyed checking out these pics on new vehicle models.2. Brace for bad chip earningsAn old boss once told me to always be on the lookout for trends. In the spirit of that, I am tossing a red flag onto the field for the approaching earnings season in the semiconductor industry.With U.S. markets closed on Friday, Samsung (005930.KS) did its best to sneak in an under-the-radar major warning on its business. The chip giant said it would make a ""meaningful"" cut to its production amid still bloated inventory levels that are weighing on prices.This is the same bearish tone markets heard from fellow chip-maker Micron (MU) when it reported earnings a few weeks ago.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.None of this is a good setup for chip-maker earnings that begin trickling in later this month. I would argue it doesn't augur well for results from PC makers such as HP Inc. and Dell, either.Even an upgrade on Intel (INTC) on Monday didn't strike me as a ""screaming buy"" call on the stock.""We have been decidedly negative on Intel's prospects for quite some time, a stance clearly justified by the company's utter collapse as a weakening market and poor decisions shaved billions off the top line, burned billions in cash, and crashed the stock price by almost 50% since CEO Pat Gelsinger arrived,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote. ""But while things still look bad, tactically we believe the medium-term set-up is, finally, improving a bit, as the company's issues are known, and numbers (for the first time in a while) may be low enough to stand.""3. McDonald's is having a momentBelieve me, after spending years covering the restaurant industry as a consumer reporter, a highly paid communications person at McDonald's (MCD) wants nothing more in life than to see their beloved fast food brand mentioned favorably somewhere in media land.Since I am in a positive mood after my birthday, I have a morsel of happiness for folks at McDonald's (and their investors) to chew on.Two calls on McDonald's from a report by longtime restaurant analyst Andy Barish at Jefferies caught our attention:""We continue to be encouraged by the Famous Meals platform as evidence of MCD's powerful brand and marketing relevancy, not to mention the same-store sales upticks and opportunity for digital engagement with loyalty &amp; mobile app usage, particularly among younger customers,"" Barish wrote. ""While we concede there is a limit to how many times they organize current menu items into a combo with a celebrity name attached and still expect big consumer buzz/sales results, Google search data indicates the recent Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal starting on Valentine's Day saw a similar level of attention as the successful J Balvin and Saweetie meals from Oct '20 and Aug '21, respectively, and only lagged the Travis Scott and BTS Meals (which had average tickets 50% lower or more given the Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal is targeted for 2 people, and the BTS Meal likely benefited from a larger and younger worldwide fanbase).""And then this:""Google search data (below) also shows “chicken big mac” is trending well in the U.S. even though it isn't available here...yet,"" the analyst added. ""This product is running as a limited-time offering in Canada, Ireland, and the UK. An August ’22 test in select Miami stores also generated a high level of Google search interest relative to MCD’s popular 'Famous Meal' LTO platform. Should the Chicken Big Mac come to U.S. stores, especially as chicken breast prices moderate, we think it would see high demand.""Another nugget: McDonald's shares are up 7.3% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% gain.The search for the chicken Big Mac.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Earlier this week, many articles on Chinese social media accused Micron of lobbying against Chinese chip firms like domestic rival Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) and Fujian Jinhua.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""Micron's product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal,"" the Boise, Idaho-based company said in a statement on Monday, adding that it was ""in communication and cooperating fully with the CAC"".The China market contributed about 11 per cent of Micron's total 2022 revenue of US$30.8 billion, with products such as DRAM, NAND flash memory and SSD products.Analysts believe the CAC investigation could accelerate the pace of localisation of products among downstream customers in the supply chain. Memory chips made by Shenzhen Longsys and BIWIN Storage Technology Co are expected to ""benefit first"", analysts at Citic Securities wrote in a research note published earlier this week.However, Micron's technology prowess in both DRAM and 3D NAND could make it harder to find domestic alternatives for advanced memory chips because its Chinese rivals like ChangXin Memory Technologies and YMTC have been under US sanctions since October 2022, curbing their ability to produce leading-edge products.Story continuesThe Citic analysts also believe that South Korean DRAM giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix could end up benefiting at Micron's expense. ""To reduce supply chain risks, domestic companies may transfer their end products/wafer purchase orders to non-US manufacturers such as Samsung and Hynix"" they said.Some analysts believe the probe could also affect Micron's customer base in China, which procures memory chips directly or indirectly from the US company for use in products such as servers, which are considered critical information infrastructure (CII) in China.CII regulations in China are expansive, covering numerous sectors considered crucial to national security, people's livelihoods, as well as public interest sectors such as communications and information services, energy, transport, water resources and finance.""The investigation focuses on supply chain security, therefore it could involve both Micron's products in China and partners along its supply chain,"" said Sun Pengcheng, a partner and attorney at law firm Dentons. ""If problems caused by use of Micron's products were detected during the investigation, it could lead to a replacement requested by the regulator.""Memory chips from Micron Technology are pictured at the company's booth at an industrial fair in Frankfurt, Germany. Photo: Reuters alt=Memory chips from Micron Technology are pictured at the company's booth at an industrial fair in Frankfurt, Germany. Photo: Reuters&gt;If Micron's products fail to pass the cybersecurity review, Chinese operators of CII will not be able to purchase Micron products, and they could even be fined for previous purchases, said Hong Yanqing, a cybersecurity expert close to the regulator.Micron's top seven customers in China, ranked by contributions to its revenue, were Lenovo, Xiaomi, Inspur Electronics Information, ZTE, Coolpad, China Electronics Corp, and Oppo, according to a search of Bloomberg data.Lenovo, Xiaomi, Oppo and Coolpad - which are in the smartphones and personal computer markets - rely on large quantities of memory chips for their products.Xiaomi declined to comment when reached by the Post on Tuesday. Oppo and Lenovo did not reply to a request for comment.Shenzhen-based ZTE, which has huge exposure to CII from its telecoms and enterprise businesses, declined to comment on Tuesday.Inspur, a major supplier of computers to data centres, was put on a US trade blacklist last month over alleged activities contrary to US national security and foreign policy interests. China Electronics Corp, which was added to the same blacklist in August 2020, is a major company in China's electronics industry.At the end of last year, Micron shrank its China presence by shutting down its DRAM design research centre in Shanghai, although it still maintains sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, as well as a semiconductor packaging and testing factory in Xian.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Shares rose.Most Read from BloombergUS-Saudi Oil Pact Breaking Down as Russia Grabs Upper HandUS Core Inflation Slows Only a Bit, Keeping Fed on Track to HikeFed Leans Toward Another Hike, Defying Staff’s Recession OutlookJPMorgan Calls Managing Directors to Office Five Days a WeekI Bonds Lose Their Luster With Yield Set to Plunge Below 4%Operating profit at the world’s largest maker of memory chips plunged more than 95% to 600 billion won ($450 million) for the three months ended March, missing the average analyst estimate of 1.4 trillion won. Sales fell 19% to 63 trillion won.Samsung said it would cut memory chip production to a “meaningful level,” a move competitors had been waiting for after a pileup of inventory hurt pricing and profits.South Korea’s largest company had resisted pulling back despite the downturn, in part to grab market share from rivals SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., which have been forced to cut output. Samsung’s cuts could help bolster chip prices, a key step for the industry’s recovery.“Because it is adjusting production and lowering memory-chip output to a meaningful level, the supply-demand situation can improve much faster,” said Baik Gilhyun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co. “Short-term concerns are coming to an end.”Samsung’s shares rose as much as 4.7% in the highest intraday jump in three months. Hynix shares surged as much as 6.7%.Still, Samsung indicated it’s committed to long-term investment in the industry.“We have cut short-term production plans, but as we project solid demand for the mid-to-long term, we will continue to invest in infrastructure to secure essential cleanrooms and to expand R&amp;D investment to solidify tech leadership,” it said in a statement.Story continuesSamsung plans to provide a full financial statement with net income and information on divisional performance later this month.The company had warned that earnings would fall in the first quarter on slowing sales. But memory prices tumbled more than anticipated because of sluggish demand for a wide range of electronics from smartphones to PCs, as consumers and companies navigated recession risks. Despite its post-Covid re-opening, China’s market has also not bounced back as quickly as some anticipated.Samsung is estimated to have lost about $3 billion in its memory chip division.The Covid pandemic whipsawed the semiconductor industry, leaving many of the biggest players struggling to keep up with market changes. Demand soared as consumers locked down at home bought new computers and smartphones. The trend quickly reversed as restrictions lifted and the global economy suffered economic shocks from rising inflation, surging interest rates and the war in Ukraine.Prices of DRAM - a type of memory used to process data - are expected to fall in the current quarter by around 10%, according to Yuanta’s Baik. That follows a roughly 20% slide in the previous three months and a more than 30% drop in the fourth quarter of last year.Micron, the largest US maker of memory chips, has said customer inventories are declining, and predicted gradual improvements to the supply-demand balance. Hynix executives have said production cuts by memory suppliers should take effect in the second half and help prop up prices. But the two Samsung rivals underscored the pace of the recovery will hinge on peers’ efforts to cut supply.The South Korean giant historically has opted against slowing down during difficult times so that it can take share from rivals. It’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build the world’s largest chip complex in its home country, and is building a new facility in the US too. The South Korean and US governments are both offering financial incentives to bolster their domestic industries.Inventory at Samsung had swelled to 52.2 trillion won at the end of last year after the company maintained production despite a collapse in demand.The existing high inventory will take time to digest, said TrendForce Senior Vice President Avril Wu. “Slower-than-expected demand in the second half of 2023 will prolong the time required for inventory to get back to normal levels.”What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysMemory-chip prices could have dropped significantly in 1Q, which might have caused an inventory valuation loss. The firm’s TV and home-appliance profit could have been sluggish due to weak end-demand caused by inflation. OLED display sales and profit in 1Q might have dropped due to lower output for the iPhone 14. Mobile-segment sales could have been solid due to the new Galaxy S23.- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI analystClick here for the full researchIt’s unclear how the US-China conflict over semiconductors might affect the industry in coming years. Last week, Beijing launched a security review of chips from Micron, spurring concerns the Chinese government is taking a more aggressive line toward American companies.Samsung managed to stay in the black during the first quarter in part because its new Galaxy S23 series bucked the overall smartphone slump. Sales of the phone lineup came to about 11 million units during those three months, up 50% compared with its predecessor, according to Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities analyst Kim Kwangjin. The smartphone division’s profit rose 123% quarter-on-quarter to 3.3 trillion won, Kim estimated.(Updates with share price reaction and analyst comment from the fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInside the IRS’s Shrinking Band of Wealth HuntersA Runner’s Murder in Kenya Opens a Window Into Violence Against WomenThe Business of … DeathThe Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Just Getting StartedWhat to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New World©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

On the contrary, the industry has gained 5.6% in the same period.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out the factors behind this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s dismal performance.Hasbro Vs Industry Scorecard Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Disappointing Performance in 2022The company’s 2022 revenues were $5.9 billion, down 9% year over year. Foreign exchange movement negatively impacted revenues by 3% year over year. Consumer Products and Entertainment revenues were $3.6 billion and $959 million, down 10% and 17% year over year, respectively. However, revenues of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming increased 3% year over year to $1.3 billion.The company’s 2022 results show operating profit margin of 7%, which declined 490 basis points (bps) from the previous year. The adjusted operating profit margin declined 20 bps to 15.7% from the previous year.Higher Costs to Hurt ProfitsHasbro's initiatives, including product launches and a shift toward more technology-driven toys for reviving its brands and boosting sales, are likely to drive profits in the long term. However, costs related to those initiatives may prove detrimental to the company in the near term. The company has shouldered high expenses with respect to freight, product costs, sales allowances, and various toy and gaming product closeouts.The company anticipates inflationary pressures to persist for the majority of 2023. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Hasbro's cost of sales (as a percentage of net revenues) was 34.6% compared with 33.9% in the prior-year quarter. Selling, distribution and administration expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 39.7% compared with 21.3% in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.

Brands:Yum! Brands, Friday, April 7, 2023, Press release pictureWe all know that representation matters, and this is especially important in business. In a new series for 2023, Pizza Hut LLC and its restaurants will be showcasing a franchisee for each heritage month (Black History Month, Women's History Month, etc.) to have a chance to get to know them more personally; learn more about their culture, background and traditions; and celebrate the diversity represented within Pizza Hut LLC's franchise group.We recently sat down with Pizza Hut franchisee Jason Cochran, Chief Executive Officer of American West Restaurant Group (AWRG), to learn more about his background and career journey, hear some of the challenges he's faced in business and discover what advice he'd give aspiring business owners.Share with us a little about your background, your career journey and how you landed where you are.""I received my MBA from Southern Methodist University (SMU Cox School of Business) in Dallas, Texas. Since then, I've accumulated more than 25 years of experience in various positions across restaurant fast casual, specialty retail, sporting goods, consumer electronics and fashion apparel. I spent 14 years at GameStop and four years at Chipotle, with my last role being Vice President of Operations. Now, at AWRG, I have the amazing job of leading the third-largest franchise group with Pizza Hut restaurants and bringing my passion for leading operational excellence across the organization.""As a mixed-race business owner, have you experienced any career challenges and, if so, how did you overcome them?""I have experienced many career challenges requiring perseverance, mainly with identifying role models and associations. Throughout my career, it was often difficult to find bi-racial mentors who I could connect with, especially on similar leadership characteristics. It's important - both personally and professionally in business - to experience having role models. However, having a growth mindset and discovering what it means to be authentic with my natural style, has opened many doors to be the best version of myself.""Story continuesWhat made you choose to be a Pizza Hut franchise owner?""I was attracted to Pizza Hut, primarily because of the many fond memories I have with my mom, dad and brother visiting our neighborhood ""red roof"" on Bethany Home Road in Glendale, Arizona. I have always had a connection with Pizza Hut and relate it to family and fun food. Having an opportunity to lead the third-largest Pizza Hut franchisee is a fulfilling way to enable a legacy of memories for thousands of store team members and millions of customers.""How do you support diverse communities in and outside of your business? What can other business leaders do to provide more support and create a more inclusive community?""I believe that supporting diversity, equity and inclusion is in three buckets for me. First, it starts with my responsibility as a husband and father of a multi-racial family. While the demands of my career consume a lot of my time, when I'm spending time with my family, I focus on being in the moment and opening conversations about how they see the world and scenarios of how others might innocently perceive them.The second bucket is as a Pizza Hut franchisee. As a franchisee, I welcome the obligation of employing people within the community who represent local customers. I strive for an organizational environment that fosters an atmosphere that provokes employees to thrive and pursue their passion. Talking with team members about their professional goals, providing support to unlock barriers, and celebrating wins is essential to creating positive outcomes. Tying these outcomes to more sales, more profit, and less cost, along with developing people, create a culture of having fun and being accountable for growth.The third bucket is as the CEO of AWRG. As a franchisee operator in business communities, it is important that our company supports investing and giving back, related to our cultural values that have the best interest for sustaining our Pizza Hut reputation. Being involved with schools - sponsoring sports events, supporting fundraisers, providing school lunches, and promoting the Pizza Hut BOOK IT! program - builds academic capabilities, which influence the future of communities we serve. It is important that AWRG does its part with Pizza Hut to cultivate systems in order to grow diversity in communities.""In celebration of Black History Month, are there any special cultural traditions or activities that you participate in?""As a family, we tend to watch biographies, documentaries, movies and read books that represent real history, progress for civil rights and our changing the world. While my sons, 13 and 10, marvel over the superhero movie series Black Panther and Creed, this year, we watched Emancipation and Till. We usually attend a festival, and my wife often attends or teaches Afro-Colombian salsa classes.""Who, within the Black community, has been your biggest inspiration - both in life and business?""I am inspired by the movement of Black community leaders in the mid-50s to late ‘60s and ‘70s in the U.S. This was the era of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., Mohammed Ali, and Shirly Chisholm - people who made bold declarations that will forever change the world for Black communities. I am most inspired by what my mother and father persevered through as a bi-racial married couple in the 1960s, when interracial marriage was banned in 16 states. I am most emotionally moved by Mildred and Richard Loving - who fought against the laws of Virginia, confining them and everyone else from marrying interracially. June 12 is Loving Day - an important day in my eyes - and it's the celebration in the U.S. marking the day the Supreme Court struck down state bans against interracial marriage.""When you were an aspiring business owner, what is some advice that would have been helpful to you or that you wish you had?""I was very fortunate to have a football coach during my teenage years who invested time, introducing me to writing positive affirmations, having goals, and maintaining a positive self-image. My advice for today's business owners and young entrepreneurs would be to ""dream BIG,"" and ""FAIL fast."" Meaning: Unleashing a mindset to envision what you really want out of life without limitations. FAIL is simply - First Attempt At Learning.""If you could tell your child-self some advice, what would it be?""Embrace who you are, regardless of differences to those around you, because it will enable the best version of yourself.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

Brands (YUM) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-yum-brands-133201386.html,1680787921,STORY,"['YUM', 'ARCO']","[Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM is likely to benefit from unit expansion, the strong Taco Bell performance and digital initiatives. Also, the emphasis on the ramped-up the rollout of Dragontail systems bodes well. However, commodity inflation and labor shortages are a concern.Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for now.Factors Driving GrowthYUM! Brands continues to focus on expansion efforts to drive growth. Considering its existing footprint of more than 50,000 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can nearly triple its current global presence over the long term. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company opened 1,830 gross units. The company reported solid developments in the KFC and Pizza Hut International divisions, with gross unit openings of 997 and 571, respectively. The company reported solid developmental contributions from each brand in China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Canada and Turkey. The company anticipates achieving a long-term unit growth of 5% in the upcoming periods.Taco Bell continues to impress investors with robust same-store sales. The company’s comps climbed 5%, 8%, 6% and 11% during the first, the second, the third and the fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. Taco Bell recorded 253 gross new restaurant openings in fourth-quarter 2022 and 496 gross new openings in 24 countries during the year. During the fourth quarter, its operating margin expanded 3200 bps year over year to 32.1%. The company announced that it is focused on building momentum in markets like the U.K., Spain and India.Yum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive. The company focuses on integrating aggregator channels into its point-of-sale system to drive growth. In 2022, the company expanded its digital initiative, Tictuk, a conversational commerce and e-commerce platform. Following the chat ordering launch in KFC Mexico, the initiative drove incremental customers and digital sales. The company is optimistic in this regard and anticipates to roll it out in 1,000 new stores in 2023.The company intends to ramp-up Dragontail Systems rollout to drive growth. The initiative allows the company to tap the powers of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and improve its delivery capabilities. Backed by positive results in certain markets, the company intends to expand this cutting-edge platform across its franchisees in the United States. The company intends to onboard about 1000 Pizza Hut stores in the United States by first-quarter 2023. By 2023, the company anticipates including this system in about 7,000 stores internationally.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 21.1% compared with the Retail – Restaurants industry’s 19.8% growth.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsThe company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. In fourth-quarter 2022, its net costs and expenses amounted to $1,441 million from $1,388 million in the prior-year quarter. The transfer of business and exit from Russia incorporated certain additional costs. Also, spikes in commodity inflation added to the downside. We believe that costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives are likely to dent margins in the near term.Moreover, labor shortages are a headwind. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksYum!

Or so investors hope.This week brought a host of misses on closely watched economic data — from the ADP employment report and ISM manufacturing data to JOLTs (the job openings report). Sure, with a 236,000 increase in March, the non-farm payrolls beat estimates slightly. But the figure was below the year-to-date average increase of 344,000 — so it also sort of tapped into the gloomier data mood.The subsequent vibe on Wall Street is that the economy may be hitting a soft patch after the March banking turmoil and after yet another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.""Risk-off sentiment has continued to grow in markets thanks to another round of weak data that’s added to fears about a potential U.S. recession,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid warned.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) all saw buyer's fatigue in the wake of the data letdowns.What didn't lack interest? Safe-haven trades such as gold, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund. Oddly enough, speculative AI names like BigBear.ai (BBAI) and SoundHound (SOUN) caught bids (here's what pros told me about this move).Amid all this activity, here are three things you may have missed this week.1. The New York Auto Show is in townWith the auto show in town, Yahoo Finance was working the scene all week to report on the latest and greatest in everything mobility.GM's (GM) CFO Paul Jacobson told me over lunch that there are no plans to turn a car's cockpit into one giant subscription service. That's reassuring considering some automakers have pondered charging subscriptions for heated seats.Story continuesThe interior of the Chrysler Airflow concept is displayed at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023. REUTERS/David 'Dee' Delgado (David Dee Delgado / reuters)And yes, Tesla came up at lunch — mostly from the view of GM looking to take a bite out of the EV leader's rich profit margins in the category.Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance's Dave Briggs found three hot trends in autos you need to know about; here's Briggs from the auto show floor. Shout out to our friends at our sister publication Autoblog — I really enjoyed checking out these pics on new vehicle models.2. Brace for bad chip earningsAn old boss once told me to always be on the lookout for trends. In the spirit of that, I am tossing a red flag onto the field for the approaching earnings season in the semiconductor industry.With U.S. markets closed on Friday, Samsung (005930.KS) did its best to sneak in an under-the-radar major warning on its business. The chip giant said it would make a ""meaningful"" cut to its production amid still bloated inventory levels that are weighing on prices.This is the same bearish tone markets heard from fellow chip-maker Micron (MU) when it reported earnings a few weeks ago.None of this is a good setup for chip-maker earnings that begin trickling in later this month. I would argue it doesn't augur well for results from PC makers such as HP Inc. and Dell, either.Even an upgrade on Intel (INTC) on Monday didn't strike me as a ""screaming buy"" call on the stock.""We have been decidedly negative on Intel's prospects for quite some time, a stance clearly justified by the company's utter collapse as a weakening market and poor decisions shaved billions off the top line, burned billions in cash, and crashed the stock price by almost 50% since CEO Pat Gelsinger arrived,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote. ""But while things still look bad, tactically we believe the medium-term set-up is, finally, improving a bit, as the company's issues are known, and numbers (for the first time in a while) may be low enough to stand.""3. McDonald's is having a momentBelieve me, after spending years covering the restaurant industry as a consumer reporter, a highly paid communications person at McDonald's (MCD) wants nothing more in life than to see their beloved fast food brand mentioned favorably somewhere in media land.Since I am in a positive mood after my birthday, I have a morsel of happiness for folks at McDonald's (and their investors) to chew on.Two calls on McDonald's from a report by longtime restaurant analyst Andy Barish at Jefferies caught our attention:""We continue to be encouraged by the Famous Meals platform as evidence of MCD's powerful brand and marketing relevancy, not to mention the same-store sales upticks and opportunity for digital engagement with loyalty &amp; mobile app usage, particularly among younger customers,"" Barish wrote. ""While we concede there is a limit to how many times they organize current menu items into a combo with a celebrity name attached and still expect big consumer buzz/sales results, Google search data indicates the recent Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal starting on Valentine's Day saw a similar level of attention as the successful J Balvin and Saweetie meals from Oct '20 and Aug '21, respectively, and only lagged the Travis Scott and BTS Meals (which had average tickets 50% lower or more given the Cardi B &amp; Offset Meal is targeted for 2 people, and the BTS Meal likely benefited from a larger and younger worldwide fanbase).""And then this:""Google search data (below) also shows “chicken big mac” is trending well in the U.S. even though it isn't available here...yet,"" the analyst added. ""This product is running as a limited-time offering in Canada, Ireland, and the UK. An August ’22 test in select Miami stores also generated a high level of Google search interest relative to MCD’s popular 'Famous Meal' LTO platform. Should the Chicken Big Mac come to U.S. stores, especially as chicken breast prices moderate, we think it would see high demand.""Another nugget: McDonald's shares are up 7.3% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% gain.The search for the chicken Big Mac.

New research from talent solutions and business consulting firm Robert Half reveals five trends for college graduates planning to launch their career:Research from Robert Half reveals what first-time job seekers can expect.Multiple interviews — Employers typically conduct four interviews with an entry-level candidate before extending an offer. But the process moves fairly quickly, with companies taking five weeks on average to make a hire.Questions that gauge soft skills — One in five managers attribute their hiring mistakes to placing too much weight on technical skills. To avoid making the same misstep, employers are asking situational questions to learn more about a candidate's traits and interpersonal abilities, such as self-motivation and collaboration, which are especially critical in hybrid and remote work environments.Preparation and follow-through — Beyond skills, managers said the following actions can tip the scales in an applicant's favor:Researching the company (67%)Maintaining a respectable online presence (51%)Sending a thank-you note after an interview (49%)In-office time — While remote work gained prominence during the pandemic, less than one in three entry-level jobs (29%) are advertised as hybrid or fully remote. However, off-site opportunities are more common for technology and finance and accounting positions.Hiring bright spots — College graduates can increase their chances of finding work by exploring roles and industries with the most jobs available. View infographics of in-demand positions and skills for entry-level professionals and additional research highlights.""While there are plenty of opportunities for the Class of 2023, upcoming graduates should prepare for a rigorous hiring process,"" said Paul McDonald, senior executive director of Robert Half. ""Landing the right job requires patience and persistence. It's important for first-time job seekers to target their search, tailor application materials, network and be proactive throughout the process.""Story continuesMcDonald offers three job search tips for new grads:Pinpoint your priorities. Figure out what matters most to you in a job so you can focus your search. Consider deal makers and breakers, and potential compromises.Request an in-person interview if the role requires in-office work. This will give you a chance to get a feel for the commute, company culture and your potential colleagues, which are all critical aspects of ensuring a good long-term fit.Prepare to negotiate. The job market continues to favor skilled workers. Ask for the salary you deserve and other nonmonetary perks you value before accepting an offer.Visit the Robert Half blog for tips on preparing for a job interview.About the ResearchFindings are based on an online survey of 2,175 hiring managers in the U.S. and propriety analysis of nearly 2 million entry-level job postings (requiring a college degree and 0-2 years of experience) on more than 1,000 independent job boards and company websites across the United States in 2022.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.79, up 55.65% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.54 billion, up 23.49% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.55 per share and revenue of $30.06 billion, which would represent changes of +13.91% and +10.04%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Paccar. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

United Parcel Service (UPS), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This package delivery service has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.20%.For the last reported quarter, UPS came out with earnings of $3.62 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 per share, representing a surprise of 1.12%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.99 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.28%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor UPS, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UPS has an Earnings ESP of +7.48% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

These are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.Despite these challenges, the industry has gained 25.6% over the past six months, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 12.3% appreciation and 13% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe believe the buoyant e-commerce demand scenario is a huge positive for the industry participants. Even though economies have reopened, consumer demand for online shopping is high. High shipping rates should also drive revenues.Given this backdrop, let’s focus on some air freight and cargo stocks — United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS and FedEx Corporation FDX — which have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.FedEx: Based in Memphis, TN, FedEx provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services in the United States and internationally. Currently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a market capitalization of $56.93 billion. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On Apr 5, FDX’s board of directors approved a dividend hike of 10%, thereby raising its quarterly cash dividend from $1.15 ($4.60 annualized) per share to $1.26 ($5.04 annualized). The raised dividend is anticipated to be paid out on Jul 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 12.Story continuesPrior to the dividend hike, FDX paid out a quarterly dividend of $1.15 ($4.60 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.00% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 27% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.72%. (Check FedEx’s dividend history here).FedEx Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)FedEx Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)FedEx Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | FedEx Corporation QuoteFedEx has been consistently making efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which are encouraging. During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, FedEx paid dividends worth $888 million (higher than $598 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2022). During fiscal 2022, FedEx paid dividends worth $793 million (higher than the $686 million dividend payout in fiscal 2021). Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but positively impact earnings per share.United Parcel: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, United Parcel provides transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, airfreight, customs brokerage, and insurance services. Currently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market capitalization of $166.36 billion.UPS pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.62 ($6.48 annualized) per share, which gives it a 3.42% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 47% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.60%.

(NYSE:UPS). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$194 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$174. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether United Parcel Service's current trading price of US$189 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at United Parcel Service’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What's The Opportunity In United Parcel Service?The stock is currently trading at US$189 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 32% compared to my intrinsic value of $143.21. This means that the opportunity to buy United Parcel Service at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that United Parcel Service’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will United Parcel Service generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of United Parcel Service, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -2.0%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe UPS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UPS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its true value, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.09bUS$1.15bUS$1.41bUS$1.54bUS$1.66bUS$1.75bUS$1.83bUS$1.90bUS$1.96bUS$2.02bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x8Analyst x5Est @ 9.31%Est @ 7.14%Est @ 5.62%Est @ 4.55%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$996US$956US$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$998US$951US$899US$846US$793(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.6bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$10bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NetApp as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.299. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NetAppStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For NetApp, we've put together three relevant elements you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 1 warning sign for NetApp we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does NTAP's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

ZBH is gaining from strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in the knee and hip businesses. The company has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets. However, consistent foreign exchange woes and stiff competition do not bode well.The renowned musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $26.98 billion. The company has a long-term projected growth of 6.2% compared with the industry’s growth projection of 14.6%. The stock has declined 1.1% compared with a 38.9% fall in the industry and a 10% decline in the S&amp;P 500.With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.Factors At PlayBusiness Recovery Continues: Zimmer Biomet witnessed a rebound in its business in the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges.In fourth-quarter 2022, U.S. sales rose 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in Zimmer Biomet’s Knee and Hip businesses. The global knees business rose 10.2%, with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%. The strong performance was driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside the United States. Global hips increased 8.4%, with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the United States.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFocus on Emerging Markets to Drive Growth: In the recent past, Zimmer Biomet has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth. The company's strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. While the integration of Biomet is over, the combined company has started to get benefitted from a strong presence in emerging markets with an extended portfolio that includes upper and lower joints.Story continuesMarkets opportunity is expected to grow to $66.6 billion by 2025 for the orthopedic implants globally. Within the emerging market, we note that strength in the Asia Pacific market has continued to drive strong revenue growth. Post the COVID-19 mayhem, Zimmer Biomet is expected to continue with this trend, banking on a cadence of product launches and strong customer adoptions.Dental and Spine Spin-Off to Bode Well: Zimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm. According to Zimmer Biomet management, this planned spin-off of its Spine and Dental business is part of the company’s third phase of ongoing transformation, which includes changing the complexion of the business through active portfolio management to accelerate growth and drive value creation. Per management, the transaction is an important next step in its transition into a more streamlined company with a focus on greater and more optimized resource allocation toward innovation in core businesses that are profitable and where it sees attractive markets with opportunities to become market leaders.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive. The orthopedic industry is highly competitive with players like Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson's DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Medtronic. Zimmer Biomet must constantly introduce or acquire new products to withstand competitive pressure and maintain its market share.Exposed to Currency Movement: Zimmer Biomet records a significant portion of its sales from the international market. This makes it highly exposed to currency fluctuations.Estimate TrendZimmer Biomet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 earnings has moved 1.4% north to $7.04.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.13 billion, suggesting a 2.8% rise from the 2022 reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on ResMed's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for ResMed How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ResMed is:22% = US$809m ÷ US$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.22 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.ResMed's Earnings Growth And 22% ROETo begin with, ResMed seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. Probably as a result of this, ResMed was able to see a decent growth of 18% over the last five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ResMed's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if ResMed is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Story continuesIs ResMed Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?ResMed has a three-year median payout ratio of 36%, which implies that it retains the remaining 64% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, ResMed is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 29% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 22%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that ResMed's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Mondelez (MDLZ), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.82%.For the last reported quarter, Mondelez came out with earnings of $0.73 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.71 per share, representing a surprise of 2.82%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.74 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.82%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Mondelez lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Mondelez currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The company has a favorable P/Sales ratio of 4.6 compared with the industry’s P/Sales ratio of 8.2. In the last reported quarter, Boston Scientific’s revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.12%. The average earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters was 0.22%.BSX is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by several recent acquisitions, including strategic investments made to complement the company’s Electrophysiology portfolio. The optimism led by the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 and bullish 2023 guidance is expected to contribute. However, exposure to competitive markets and flat sales of the company’s pacemaker device are major downsides.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey Growth DriversAcquisitions to Add Value: We are upbeat about Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions, which will potentially boost the top line in the long term.In February 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Baylis Medical Company. The Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated Transseptal access and remains on track to achieve its full-year expectations.Further, Boston Scientific recently announced its plans to buy a majority stake in M.I. Tech to broaden the company’s Neuromodulation product line. The strategic investment in the Chinese medical technology company, Acotec, is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s drug-coated balloon offerings.In November 2022, BSX also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Apollo Endosurgery. The $615 million acquisition deal will add a complementary and innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio to the company.Story continuesPromising Growth From WATCHMAN Device: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. The next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.In the fourth quarter, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 22% year over year. BSX recently completed the enrollment of the CHAMPION-AF trial way ahead of the schedule.Per a representative of the company, this head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLEX in 2027 and beyond.Currently, the company expects double-digit growth within WATCHMAN in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence and strong commercial execution.A Strong Q4 Performance: Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed its industry. In the fourth quarter, Boston Scientific’s revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues.Organic revenues in each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.The 2023 guidance given by the company appeared bullish. This indicates that Boston Scientific is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.DownsidesA Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical device market highly competitive.

Ultimately, the contract is potentially worth around $70 billion - over decades - depending on how many the Army and U.S. allies order, the Army has said.In the FLARAA competition was Bell's V-280 ""Valor,"" a tiltrotor aircraft that has reached speeds in excess of 340 mph (547 kph) according to the Army. It beat out the entrant from Lockheed's Sikorsky unit and Boeing Co's SB-1 ""Defiant"" which has two coaxial rotors and a single pusher propeller and has reached speeds of 265 mph (426 kph), according to the Army.“We remain confident the Lockheed Martin Sikorsky and Boeing team submitted the most capable, affordable and lowest-risk Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft solution.

LMT recently clinched a modification contract involving F-35 fighter jets. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $18.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by January 2026. The latest modification allows Lockheed to provide depot tooling and test equipment for establishing the initial depot repair of radio frequency support electronics and multi-function antenna components for the F-35 aircraft.Work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs, boost demand significantly.This, in turn, results in a solid contract flow from Pentagon and other U.S. allies for production and other associated support for modernizing and upgradation of the F-35 jets. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Impressively, the F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022. Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in the backlog till December 2022.Looking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to reap the benefits of the abovementioned market’s expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to gain from the global military aircraft market’s growth opportunities.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft. From fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare, it has been providing manned solutions to customers worldwide. The company has built some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.Its Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems. The Mission Systems segment offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control, LONGBOW Fire Control Radar and Scalable Agile Beam Radar.Airbus Group’s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived.The company has been providing its aircraft customers with an extended portfolio of services for more than 40 years, ranging from the training of flight and ground staff to live firing exercises anywhere around the world.Textron’s military aircraft includes the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft, and the T-1A jet trainer.Its subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services for commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.Price MovementShares of Lockheed have gained 7.8% in the past 12 months against the industry’s 7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

363,d297db8c-997d-3839-948a-55a5bb8db1bc,KO,2023-04-08,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-140020933.html,1680876020,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Coca-Cola implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Coca-Cola. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Coca-Cola is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Coca-Cola Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.8b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Coca-Cola. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.85 billion, up 3.39% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.60 per share and revenue of $44.82 billion. These totals would mark changes of +4.84% and +4.21%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Coca-Cola is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Coca-Cola has a Forward P/E ratio of 24.17 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 24.79.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that KO currently has a PEG ratio of 3.63.

Therefore, identifying the optimal stocks to acquire presently or monitor requires careful consideration. In times of increased uncertainty, many investors are rightly turning to defensive stocks as a way to play the current market. Unfortunately, defensive stocks are just about as difficult to pick as any other group.Defensiveness is key to many investors, in light of the ongoing aggressive policy stance taken by the Federal Reserve. In a bid to stomp out inflation, the Fed has raised rates at its fastest pace in decades. For growth stocks and other interest rate sensitive areas of the economy, this has been bad news.However, these three companies have held up relatively well and have weathered their fair share of previous crises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThus, without further ado, let’s dive into three defensive stocks worth buying in April, for those looking to reposition their portfolios.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comIf you identify as a committed contrarian and value investor, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock is worth considering. Unlike other financial institutions, the company is not excessively reliant on Treasury bonds, thereby minimizing the risk of failure. Additionally, recent turmoil in the banking sector suggests clients also abandon less trustworthy banks, transferring their deposits to established financial powerhouses such as JPMorgan Chase. With several mid-sized banks failing in recent weeks, consolidation in the financial sector is taking hold once again. Thus, those bullish on JPM from a growth perspective will certainly like how the bank is positioned in this regard.That said, it’s JPMorgan’s defensive positioning, and size, which allows the bank the optionality to pursue such deals. We’ll see if any additional buyouts take place in the coming weeks. But for now, the company’s rolling 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.6-times is attractive, considering the expectations for earnings growth on the horizon.Story continuesSure, we may be headed into a recession, and earnings may decline. Perhaps issues within the banking sector are more widespread than many initially thought. Time will tell with respect to these factors.That said, I think JPM stock is the best-in-class option in the financials sector for those looking to hunker down. With a yield of 3.07%, investors are paid to be patient and ride out any period of uncertainty from here.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple LayoffsSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comTech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen revenues dip due to production constraints and negative macroeconomic conditions, which has caused its share price to stagnate over the past year. Despite this, many investors may rightly be contemplating whether AAPL is worth buying. Indeed, the stock has been on an incredible run to start 2023, and this momentum could continue moving forward.Apple is currently the most prominent firm worldwide, particularly in terms of market weighting. The tech behemoth has amassed a dedicated following of enthusiasts, with each product launch generating immense hype worldwide, bordering on a cult-like fervor. Indeed, Apple is overall met with great excitement from numerous devoted fans, who often purchase the latest gadgets with unwavering eagernessThe current economic period is characterized by high inflation, escalating interest rates, and sluggish growth, which undoubtedly presents significant challenges. Although a recession would undoubtedly hurt the company’s revenue, investors can still count on consistent demand from consumers who consider Apple’s gadgets crucial.As a result, Apple might navigate through an economic downturn with minimal damage, while reaping the rewards of elevated demand when the economy eventually picks up. There are numerous appealing aspects to investing in AAPL. That said, the company’s status as one of the best defensive stocks to buy now can’t be debated.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is an ideal option for those seeking a dependable, defensive stock with a steady dividend. The well-known beverage company, favored by Warren Buffett, has gained a significant following as an attractive investment opportunity. With a negligible fall from its peak, and a stock price that’s still hovering around the top end of its five-year band, KO stock is trading at a valuation that’s near its all-time high.So, then, why is now a great time to consider Coca-Cola?Well, many of the same arguments are true for KO as with the other stocks on this list. Coca-Cola is one of the world-class defensive stocks that investors flock to in times of trouble. Indeed, as a bastion of stability for top investors, this company has proven its ability to provide very consistent returns over decades. Most other companies can’t say the same thing.Coke’s business model is less-cyclical, as beverages and snack items sell in good economic times and bad. Thus, Coke’s growth rate has been closely correlated to its ability to grow market share and acquire other brands over time.I think the underlying investment thesis with owning KO stock remains intact. As far as long-term defensive stocks are concerned, Coca-Cola remains a top pick of mine.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in AAPL, KO. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

367,76e25515-0d04-3227-be9e-dd8e6cdc0980,KO,2023-04-08,The 7 Best Forever Stocks to Buy for April 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-forever-stocks-buy-113000955.html,1680607800,STORY,"['MA', 'MO', 'AAPL', 'COST', 'MELI', 'KO']","[The good thing about forever stocks is you only have to buy them once.A passive, long-term approach to investing has several advantages. For one, it doesn’t rely on predicting difficult, if not impossible, short-term fluctuations. Buying forever stocks results in a stable core portfolio of investments that repeatedly provide better returns than actively managed investments. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBuying forever stocks is the strategy of legendary names including Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle among others. The strategy requires a firm belief in the value of well-run companies with established businesses. Most of the forever stocks below have been around for several decades at least. But there’s also reason to believe that younger companies are worthy of taking a long-term view as well.MAMastercard$366.09MELIMercadoLibre $1,312.08AAPLApple $166.06KOCoca-Cola $62.40JPMJPMorgan Chase $130.16COSTCostco $497.03MOAltria$44.98Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comInvesting in Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock right now is a simple decision as this is one of the forever stocks that has staying power. The company is an integral part of the consumer finance industry and connects businesses, consumers, and merchants to one another via payments. In 2022, Mastercard’s business boomed for a few reasons. When Covid-era restrictions vanished, international travel increased dramatically. Mastercard saw its cross-border volume increase by 45% in 2022. Overall, consumers used their credit cards more, resulting in revenues that increased by 18% at the company. With consumer credit card debt again reaching new heights post-pandemic, Mastercard looks to be in a sound position. It wouldn’t be surprising if Mastercard receives very high fee income moving forward if delinquencies rise and higher charges ensue. It’s difficult to see that not occurring as savings are drawn down and credit card use spikes. The signs are clear and macroeconomic realities make it a good time to buy MA stock. Story continuesMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is an outlier relative to other stocks on this list. The eCommerce company is by far the youngest listed here and has a far shorter track record. It is established and stable but is lacking relative to other firms. However, its progress and potential make it a long-term buy despite its relative youth. The company is the eCommerce champion of the Latin-American region, often referred to as the region’s Amazon. When you look into the company’s growth and metrics, it’s easy to draw such a comparison. MercadoLibre’s eCommerce revenues grew by an astounding 56.6% in Q4, to $3.0 billion. Its fintech/payments business is especially impressive, having processed $36 billion of payments, up 80% on a year-over-year basis. And MercadoLibre continues transforming its logistics into a world-class operation. It handles 2.5X the volume it did in 2019 and now delivers 80% of packages in 48 hours, up from 44% in 2019. That snapshot of short-term wins alludes to a much greater narrative being built with long term success in mind. Apple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been among the greatest success stories in the recent history of the stock market. It has grown at an average annual rate of 27.2% over the past decade. As a result, it is now the world’s most valuable company based on market capitalization. The past decade was extraordinarily kind to growth firms, as interest rates remained near zero. While that certainly contributed to Apple’s massive growth during the period, the next decade will undoubtedly be different. That doesn’t mean Apple can’t provide strong returns. The iPhone, Mac, and iPad seller has become integral to society. My colleague Will Ashworth expects Apple to grow at an annual rate close to 20% over the next decade. That rate will multiply any investment’s value and is a return any investor would gladly receive.AAPL stock remains the biggest component of Warren Buffett’s portfolio by a long shot. That alone should tell investors a lot about its long-term prospects.Coca-Cola (KO)a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cansSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.comOne way to choose forever stocks is buying iconic brands like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). That such companies have been around for so long and have become inseparable from our society speaks volumes. Those factors suggest that demand is unlikely to decline simply because of how deeply ingrained the company is within our culture. In actuality, no brand may be more iconic than Coca-Cola. Therefore, it’s likely to continue to flourish. Demand for Coca-Cola brand products grew by 5% in 2022 based on unit case volume. That led to a sales increase of 11%. However, in Q4 demand actually declined by 1% contradicting my thesis above. The good news is that the companywide revenues increased by 7% in the quarter despite sagging volume. Whatever the case, KO stock has emerged as an ultra-dependable investment, especially over the past year. Its dividend is as sure as they come having last been reduced in 1963. It will provide income forever and likely share price appreciation at the same time. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefrontSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the biggest U.S. bank and the third largest bank globally. In recent weeks, it has emerged as a sort of backstop for weaker banks across the U.S. The firm now looks to become even stronger as a result of overall regional bank weakness. JPMorgan Chase’s dominant position will only increase as a result of current turmoil. It will extend its lead over the U.S. banking sector in the coming years. The bank recently led the charge to infuse First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) with capital. Big banks are better run than they were in the last financial meltdown. But regional banks lacking in risk management and regulatory oversight foundered. The result played out over the past few weeks. JPM stock is one of the primary beneficiaries of the debacle. Deposits flooded in following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. The company is now perceived as a bastion of security in the banking sector.  Costco (COST) Source: ShutterstockCostco (NASDAQ:COST) stock has received a lot of attention over the last year as Americans’ finances have weakened. Consumers are seeking deals anywhere they can and Costco’s bulk foods fit that bill. Costco isn’t just a short-term value. Over the past decade, it has provided a 19.3% average annual return. Costco currently operates 848 warehouses globally. It is currently the 3rd largest U.S. retailer behind only Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the 6th largest globally. Another thing to note is just how quickly Costco has grown more than doubling its revenue base between 2014 and 2022. Over the last 24 weeks, sales have grown by 5.9% and 6.8% in the last 12 weeks. Costco simply has so much going that it seems obvious to bet on the company over the long term. Currently, analysts expect approximately $50 of upside beyond its $495 share price over the next 12-18 months. Altria (MO)Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comAltria (NYSE:MO) remains a very interesting stock to invest in right now. On the one hand, the tobacco giant is clearly facing problems. The war on smoking is working and Altria saw revenues decline by 3.5% in 2022 and 2.3% in the fourth quarter. The company has rebranded itself toward a primarily smoke-free future. It is enticing current investors with heavy share repurchases and high-yield dividends while also purchasing assets in growth areas. The company completed its $3.5 billion share repurchase program at the end of 2022 and authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Altria paid $6.6 billion in dividends in 2022 alone. That dividend currently yields 8.44% and hasn’t been reduced since 1970(2). But Altria must continue moving into smoke free tobacco. Falling revenues necessitate it. The company purchased vape brand NJOY Holdings recently. People will continue to use nicotine whether in cigarette form or vapes or whatever else can be created to deliver it. That simple fact means Altria should continue to provide investor returns even as cigarette sales decline. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With this innovative potential comes the promise of exceptional long-term growth. And all could make fintech an enticing sector for investors with a high-risk appetite.Although 2022 proved to be a challenging year for fintech stocks to buy, 2023 offers a more optimistic outlook.

In that department, PayPal’s management has done a remarkable job limiting operating expense growth to 2.7% in the past year.PayPal’s potential for a robust recovery is evident in line with the economic snapback. Moreover, another key growth catalyst for the platform is its mobile app users, which usually engage in 60% more transactions per user. PayPal has enormous potential for growth with its mobile platform, with roughly 200 million accounts yet to embrace the app.Story continuesVisa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit-card giant Visa (NYSE:V) remains a titan in the realm of financial transactions.

Though it sports a modest market cap compared to other companies on the list, its growth potential is sky-high as it marches toward profitability. By fiscal 2024, analysts expect its loss-per-share to narrow down to just four cents, a 92.6% improvement from 2022.Toast’s all-in-one software platform powers a remarkable 74,000 restaurants across the U.S. and is just beginning to tap into a colossal market of over a million locations.

Moreover, its net retention rate, an important gauge to assess the annual revenue generated from its loyal customer base customers, climbed from 121% in 2020 to 128% by the year-end.

It’s a small business, and the self-employed segment remains it’s most lucrative, which accounts for more than 60% of total revenue and is growing by double-digit margins.

Moreover, its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other macro-headwinds weighed down its top and bottom-line results. Nevertheless, the strong showing in the past couple of quarters, Bitcoin’s resurgence, and the slowdown in interest rate hikes, points to an incredibly bright outlook.Block has since evolved into a formidable force in the fintech space since rolling out its card reader service in Square. It later added the widely popular Cash App in 2013 and began exploring innovative ways effectively bridge the gap between the two ecosystems.Enter the acquisition of Afterpay in Feb. last year, which had a dual effect of adding a novel “buy now, pay later” feature for Square sellers while empowering cash app users to have greater control.

However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 17.8% compared with the industry’s 0.6% growth so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 7.3% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $108.85 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.7% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.5% compares favorably with the industry’s (2.6%) yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book, despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable the company to sustain the momentum in robot sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako. Following a soft fourth quarter of 2022, the Mako installations touched a record high during the fourth quarter. The company remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in 2023, on the back of new launches and software upgrades.Stryker is focused on the continued expansion of the robotic surgery platform and is progressing well with it in international markets. The initiatives reflect the demand for Stryker’s differentiated Mako robotic technology.Additionally, SYK has a diversified product portfolio. The company’s wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil. Stryker’s significant exposure to robotics, artificial intelligence for health care and Medical Mechatronics has helped it stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.Story continuesOn its fourth-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19. Although hospital staffing pressure remained in certain regions, the company expects this challenge to resolve gradually. This, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in 2023.Per management, the company’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the pandemic subsides. In 2022, Stryker’s adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 6.7% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September, SYK launched its new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company stated that the Q Guidance system has exceeded management’s expectations.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising. The adjusted SG&amp;A expenses during 2022 were 32.7% of net sales, contracting 90 basis points year over year.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable pricing environment poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. On its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the quarter’s average selling days were in line with the prior-year period. The impact from pricing was 0.6% in the last reported quarter. Consequently, pricing pressure remains a cause of concern. Unfavorable currency rate fluctuation also hurt the top line, which may continue to impact revenues moderately in the first half of 2023.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $10.02, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.3%. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues is $19.75 billion, indicating a 7% improvement year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, Henry Schein HSIC and The Cooper Companies COO.Becton, Dickinson and Company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth of 7.8%.

This goal is aligned with the UL ECVP 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill standard, which requires at least 95 percent diversion from landfills.""Sustainability is central to Whirlpool Corporation's culture. We are relentless in our efforts to improve the way we produce and manufacture our products to deliver on our social and environmental sustainability goals while not compromising product performance,"" said Marc Bitzer, CEO and chairman, Whirlpool Corporation. ""Our Zero Waste to Landfill achievement is a significant milestone that underscores the commendable dedication and collective commitment from our team to drive meaningful change. We will continue to unite our sustainable practices with our corporate purpose to support our communities and grow our business.""Zero Waste to Landfill is part of Whirlpool Corporation''s ongoing commitment to World Class Manufacturing (WCM), which sets the highest standards for manufacturing excellence and is the foundation for the company's sustainable manufacturing journey. The company continues to score higher along the WCM Environmental criteria and has led several key initiatives besides ZWtL, including in biodiversity, green buildings, renewable energy, and energy retrofits.To achieve the Zero Waste to Landfill goal, Whirlpool Corporation has maintained an unwavering commitment to do the right thing for consumers and the planet while not compromising product performance. Recognizing its climate impact, in 2021 the company also announced a commitment to reach a net zero emissions target (scope 1 and 2) in its global plants and operations by 2030, spanning all direct (Scope 1) and power-related (Scope 2) emissions.Story continuesSeveral actions have already been implemented towards this goal:The company has reduced its carbon footprint by accelerating energy-saving plant retrofits and entering two wind Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs) that will generate wind energy equivalent to 100% of Whirlpool Corp.'s U.S. manufacturing plant energy consumption.The company also issued its inaugural $300 million sustainability bond in April of 2021 to finance social and environmental projects across the organization.In February of 2022, Whirlpool Corporation joined the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Better Climate Challenge which targets a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent within 10 years and collaborating with the DOE and other organizations to cut carbon and save energy.""For more than 50 years, Whirlpool Corporation has prioritized social and environmental sustainability to support its people, the communities where we live and operate, and the planet,"" said Sr. VP of Community Relations and Sustainability Pam Klyn.

If awarded, the grant would help offset the costs of wildfire hardening efforts on and around federally recognized Tribal Nations' land within SDG&amp;E's service territory. Pending final approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the federal funds would be matched with an additional $100 million from SDG&amp;E.""Our region has the most federally recognized Tribes of any county in the nation, and all are located in areas facing the highest risk for wildfire. These funds would help us continue to work with Tribes to provide safe and resilient energy in the face of a changing climate,"" said Caroline Winn, CEO of SDG&amp;E. ""If approved, this grant would not only help advance wildfire safety initiatives planned on Tribal lands which have experienced wildfires and Public Safety Power Shutoffs in the past, but also plays a key role in in our strategy to reduce energy costs for customers.""As the company prioritizes strategic undergrounding of more power lines, the grant would help SDG&amp;E leverage a good portion of its existing and planned fire hardening efforts over the next three years across the majority of Tribal Nations the company serves. The funding would further the company's efforts to strengthen its energy infrastructure and create communities that are safer, stronger and healthier by hardening approximately 70 miles of SDG&amp;E's electric grid. This includes undergrounding approximately 64 miles of power line and covering 6 miles of line with covered conductor, benefiting up to 10 of the region's Tribal communities.Story continuesSeeking state and federal funds to pay for climate adaptation measures is an important element of SDG&amp;E's four-part strategy to lessen the financial burden and improve affordability for customers which also includes:Pursuing additional federal funds available by maximizing federal tax credits for battery storage and microgrid facilities that can be refunded to customers;Advocating for legislation (AB 982) to remove costs from electric rates that could reduce monthly bills up to 7% and legislation to spread the cost of wildfire safety improvements over a longer period of time to reduce rate impacts;Modernizing the way electricity is priced; andStabilizing natural gas bills by advocating for improved utilization of existing infrastructure.SDG&amp;E submitted its application this week and anticipates receiving outcome notification from the DOE this summer. Prior to acceptance of any grant that is awarded, SDG&amp;E will also need to receive CPUC approval. Then construction would take place between 2024 and 2026. If the grant application is denied, the company still plans to move forward with the fire hardening projects pending approval from the CPUC.SDG&amp;E is an innovative San Diego-based energy company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The company is committed to creating a sustainable future by providing its electricity from renewable sources; modernizing natural gas pipelines; accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles; supporting numerous non-profit partners; and, investing in innovative technologies to ensure the reliable operation of the region's infrastructure for generations to come.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Sempra (SRE) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.90 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.90 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.88 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Sempra has an Earnings ESP of 0.49%.SRE is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Edison International (EIX) as well.Edison International is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 2, 2023.

Understandably, this narrative runs counter to the apparently prevailing wisdom of the moment. For example, even legendary hedge-fund manager Michael Burry stated that he was “wrong to say sell.” Nevertheless, let’s look at the fundamentals.While the U.S. government responded quickly and decisively to recent bank failures, here’s the deal: every action generates a reaction. For federal authorities to protect depositors suggests an inflationary framework, exactly the directive policymakers want to avoid. Besides, if government action was the correct response to every problem, why aren’t we asking the government to get involved in everything? Again, the answer is that every decision (particularly major ones) carries consequences. Essentially, we might not be out of the woods just yet. Therefore, below are the reliable or relevant stocks to buy.KOCoca-Cola$62.40SRESempra Energy$149.58STMSTMicroelectronics$52.89VTRUVitru$21.04ABEVAmbev$2.81ANDEAndersons$41.73BGBunge$96.66InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCoca-Cola (KO)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA business icon, beverage manufacturer Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) symbolizes one of the brands of American free market capitalism. Just that status alone affords Coca-Cola significant social cachet, even during a potential downturn. Fundamentally, the company may benefit from the trade-down effect. Rather than purchase their caffeine fix from an overpriced café, consumers can always go to their local grocery stores and pick up a six-pack of Coke.In terms of stability, Coca-Cola features an Altman Z-Score of 4.42, indicating low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. Also, it quietly gets the job done operationally. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 4.6%, above 56.52% of the sector. As well, its book growth rate during the same period is 7.9%, above 64.13% of the competition. Perhaps most notably, Coca-Cola makes a name for itself in the profitability department. For example, its net margin pings at 22.19%, outpacing 93.46% of its peers.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $68.18, implying nearly 10% upside potential. Thus, it’s an intriguing case for stocks to buy.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA public utility holding firm, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is one of the largest such entities in the U.S. According to its public profile, Sempra serves nearly 40 million consumers. Given its massive reach – and the fact that utilities represent natural monopolies – SRE ranks among the stocks to buy amid banking sector concerns. That said, SRE is on a relative discount, losing almost 2% since the Jan. opener.If that wasn’t compelling enough for speculators, SRE dipped more than 11% in the trailing year. To be fair, its financials don’t offer the greatest level of confidence. However, because Sempra serves large swathes of the economic engine known as Southern California, investors don’t have to worry as much about the print. Still, that’s not to say that Sempra can’t hold its own. For instance, its net margin pings at 14.81%.And it benefits from consistent annual profitability. Lastly, covering analyst peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $168.11, implying over 11% upside potential.STMicroelectronics (STM)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Based in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) represents an unsung hero in the technology space. A semiconductor manufacturer, STM undergirds various innovations while staying in the background. Because of its tremendous relevance, STM easily ranks among the stocks to buy during banking troubles. Indeed, shares gained more than 51% since the Jan. opener, a simply blistering figure.Nevertheless, STM may offer room to run. In particular, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 12.65. As a discount to projected earnings, STM ranks better than 82.09% of the semiconductor industry. In addition, the company represents an operational powerhouse. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.1%, outpacing 68.54% of sector rivals. Further, its net margin comes in at 24.6%, blowing past 86.25% of the field. To top it off, the enterprise features an Altman Z-Score of 6.39, indicating very low bankruptcy risk.In closing, analysts peg STM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $61.20, implying over 14% upside potential.Vitru (VTRU)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Brazil, Vitru (NASDAQ:VTRU) is the nation’s largest private education institution, per the company’s website. Given Brazil’s vast population and abundant natural resources, investing in its educational infrastructure could yield significant gains. Since the start of the year, VTRU moved up over 3%. In the trailing one-year period, it returned stakeholders 44%.Despite its impressive performance, VTRU makes for an intriguing case for stocks to buy. Overall, the company owns a stable balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score hit triple digits. Also, its debt-to-EBITDA sits at 0.03 times, favorably below the sector median value of 2.15.Operationally, Vitru’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 21.3%, above 79.46% of its rivals. Its book growth rate during the same period pings at a lofty 37.2%. On the bottom line, Vitru’s net margin is almost 13%, above 72% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analyst peg VTRU as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $27, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Ambev (ABEV)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAlso based in Brazil, Ambev (NYSE:ABEV) is a powerhouse in the brewery business. Should the global economy struggle, Ambev might be an interesting idea for stocks to buy. Essentially, the stress of yet another hardship might accelerate alcohol sales due to consumers wanting to take the edge off. Notably, since the beginning of the year, ABEV gained nearly 9% of its equity value.Against the trailing-year comparison, ABEV still has some work to do. Still, the red ink makes the beverage investment appealing to contrarians. For example, the market prices ABEV at a forward multiple of 16.38. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 77.27% of the underlying industry. Operationally, Ambev commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.3%. Its book growth rate during the same period is a respectable 10.1%. Finally, its Altman Z-Score hits 3.47, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Looking to the Street, analysts peg ABEV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $3.35, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Andersons (ANDE)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn American agribusiness, Andersons (NYSE:ANDE) is one of the stocks to buy for its critical relevancies. Per its corporate profile, Andersons conducts business in the commodity merchandising, renewables, and plant nutrient sectors. Not surprisingly, since the start of the year, ANDE gained nearly 22% of its equity value. However, it trades at a relative discount, down more than 17% in the past 365 days.If you can handle choppy weather, ANDE deserves closer inspection. First, the market prices ANDE at a trailing multiple of 10.87. As a discount to earnings, Andersons ranks better than 74.57% of the competition. Second, it enjoys stability in the balance sheet, buoyed by an Altman Z-Score of 4.69.Operationally, Andersons delivers a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.7%, an impressive performance. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 22%, above 66.15% of the field. Finally, analysts peg ANDE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $52.50, implying 27% upside potential.Bunge (BG)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAnother agribusiness and food-focused enterprise, Bunge (NYSE:BG) deserves consideration as one of the stocks to buy for permanent relevance. No matter what happens in the economy, people have to eat. Since the start of the year, BG dipped a hair below parity. In the trailing one-year period, it gave up more than 15% of its equity value.While that certainly sounds risky, Bunge shouldn’t be ignored because it’s also quite tempting. Perhaps most conspicuously, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 7.99. As a discount to projected earnings, Bunge ranks better than 86.22% of the competition.Also, the company delivers on the operational front. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at a healthy 14.7%. As well, its book growth rate during the same period is 18.7%, outpacing nearly 83% of sector rivals. Lastly, analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $123, implying nearly 29% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

377,dd1850f1-8b7f-34d9-ba49-c83f12630ce1,LYB,2023-04-08,7 Reliable Dividend Stocks With Low-Payout Ratios,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-reliable-dividend-stocks-low-205746586.html,1680555466,STORY,"['HMC', 'HPQ', 'PFE', 'HRB', 'LYB', '8591.T']","[While it’s always good to have decent exposure to investments yielding passive income, you also want to consider reliable dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. By that, I’m referring to enterprises that pay their dividends via a relatively small pool of their earnings. Generally, companies that feature a payout ratio between 20% to 50% offer confidence for yield sustainability.That’s not to say that companies featuring high-payout ratios are doomed to slash their dividends. However, the advantage is that enterprises undergird dividend stocks with low-payout ratios centered on “margin.” Should economic circumstances worsen, low-payout businesses own more room to protect their dividends and reward their shareholders. In other words, not all passive-income-providing companies stand on equal footing. Below are reliable dividend stocks with low-payout ratios.HRBH&amp;R Block$35.45HMCHonda Motor$26.79HPQHP.$29.89IXORIX$83.60PFEPfizer$41.35LYBLyondellBasell$95.20SBSWSibanye Stillwater$8.27InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsH&amp;R Block (HRB)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comWith tax day fast approaching, you might think that H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) is about to lose its relevance. However, the Covid-19 pandemic sparked multiple paradigm shifts, including in the workforce. Long story short, worker bees may consider a transition to the gig economy, which would benefit H&amp;R Block’s consultancy services. After all, gig workers feature tax profiles similar to “real” businesses.Another factor benefitting HRB is its relatively undervalued profile. Yes, shares gained nearly 34% of equity value in the open market. However, HRB features a modest forward multiple of only 8.39. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 80% of the personal services industry.Moving onto passive income, H&amp;R Block carries a forward yield of 3.29%. Even better, its payout ratio sits at 27.87%. Therefore, it’s easily one of the dividend stocks with low-payout ratios to consider. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg HRB as a consensus hold. Nevertheless, their average price target is $38, implying nearly 8% upside potential.Story continuesHonda Motor (HMC)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA company that gets plenty of attention among its customers but not so much in the investment field, Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC) nevertheless offers an intriguing opportunity regarding dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. As a provider of reliable vehicles, Honda represents an indelible component of global roadways. Should economic circumstances worsen, vehicular reliability will likely command a premium.Financially, HMC may attract investors because of its undervalued nature. In particular, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.15. As a discount to earnings, Honda ranks better than 75.28% of the competition. Also, it’s a profitable enterprise, featuring a net margin of 4.32% that beats out 60.87% of rivals. Regarding passive income, Honda carries a forward yield of 3.34%.Also, its payout ratio sits at 23.12%, again easily making it one of the dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. Currently, no one covers HMC. However, Jefferies analyst Takaki Nakanishi rated shares a buy nine months ago, with a $31.51 price target implying 19% upside potential.HP (HPQ)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA consumer technology specialist, HP (NYSE:HPQ) provides various computer equipment and digital accessories. On the surface, forecasts about the death of the personal computer might rattle prospective investors of HP. However, HPQ performed well so far this year, gaining nearly 10% of equity value. Still, it remains risky overall, losing almost 18% in the past 365 days.Despite challenges, HPQ stands poised to attract contrarians of dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. First, the market prices HPQ at a forward multiple of 8.76. As a discount to projected earnings, the tech firm ranks better than 87.87% of the underlying industry. Also, HP features strong expansionary trends, particularly its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9%.For passive income, HP carries a forward yield of 3.58%. That’s notably above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 29.19%. To be fair, HPQ carries a moderate sell rating. However, analysts may be overlooking its robust financials.ORIX (IX)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockProbably an unknown to most investors in the U.S., ORIX (NYSE:IX) is a Japanese diversified financial services group. Per its corporate profile, ORIX offers leasing, lending, rentals, life insurance, real estate financing and development, venture capital, investment, retail banking, commodities funds, and securities brokering. Since the Jan. opener, IX gained a bit over 1%.In the trailing one-year period, IX lost more than 19% of its equity value. However, for contrarians seeking dividend stocks with low-payout ratios, ORIX could be intriguing. Notably, the market prices IX at a trailing multiple of 8.15. As a discount to earnings, ORIX ranks better than 65.26% of the firms in the credit services industry. Operationally, the company features a respectable three-year sales growth rate of 8.9%. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is 9.57%, reflecting a high-quality business. Regarding passive income, ORIX carries a forward yield of 3.81%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 23.55%.Pfizer (PFE)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAlthough one of the hottest dividend stocks with low-payout ratios during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) lost some of its edge. With fears of Covid contraction fading substantially, Pfizer lacks another impetus. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, PFE dropped more than 20% in equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s down almost 21%.Still, contrarians may have an enticing opportunity here. For example, the market prices PFE at a forward multiple of 11.96. As a discount to projected earnings, Pfizer ranks better than 69.11% of the drug manufacturing industry. Also, it trades at 8.98 times free cash flow (FCF). In contrast, the sector median value is 22.51 times. Looking at the passive income department, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.02%. That’s much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio comes in at 42.25%, which is still respectably low.LyondellBasell (LYB)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in the Netherlands, LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) is a chemical company. Per its public profile, LyondellBasell is the largest licensor of polyethylene and polypropylene technologies. Given its everyday relevancies for various industrial applications, it’s no surprise the market responded well to LYB. Since the Jan. opener, it’s up nearly 12%. However, in the trailing year, it’s down more than 9%.Nevertheless, LYB is almost sure to attract contrarian investors of dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. In particular, the market prices LYB at a forward multiple of 10.14. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 75.16% of the competition. In addition, LYB trades at 0.61 times trailing sales, lower than the sector median value of 1.25 times.Also, LyondellBasell features a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.12%. Its FCF growth rate during the same period is 26.2%. Both stats rank in the top half of the underlying sector. Finally, regarding passive income, LyondellBasell carries a forward yield of 5.07%. Its payout ratio comes in at 44.09%, a respectable tradeoff considering the generous yield.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockLocated in South Africa, precious metals miner Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) offers a tempting proposition among dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. To be fair, it’s not the most stable enterprise. So far this year, SBSW dropped over 23% of equity value if that tells you anything. However, with gold prices generally rising amid broader economic concerns, SBSW could become a cynical beneficiary.For sure, Sibanye ranks as a speculative opportunity among dividend stocks with low-payout ratios. In the past 365 days, it dropped 50%. However, SBSW trades at a forward multiple of 6. As a discount to projected earnings, Sibanye ranks better than 76.32% of the field. Also, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20%. Its net margin comes in at 13.3%. Both stats rank in the industry’s upper half. Lastly, Sibanye carries a forward yield of 6.4%, which should raise eyebrows. Even better, its payout ratio sits at 29%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.36%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.91%.Heading into today, shares of the industrial conglomerate had gained 8.36% over the past month, outpacing the Conglomerates sector's loss of 2.19% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.24% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Electric as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. In that report, analysts expect General Electric to post earnings of $0.12 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 50%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $13.36 billion, down 21.62% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.98 per share and revenue of $61.68 billion, which would represent changes of -24.43% and -19.43%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

France and Canada-based Flying Whales is constructing a 200-meter-long vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) airship made for the heavy-load transport market.HON's one-megawatt generator system can merge easily with propulsion and operational systems for piloted or autonomous aircraft. Without making any alterations to electric propulsion engines, it can also be used as a one-megawatt motor. When installed into the LCA60T, the generator is also capable of creating a hybrid propulsion system in integration with a gearbox and a turbine that leverages jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It will also supply electrical power to the engines. This will create a systematic and sustainable form of travel, which will be identical to hybrid-electric automobiles.

383,d1ee5ab1-d332-3f03-a343-6eea6f24f461,GE,2023-04-08,7 Stocks to Buy for the Massive Rally Ahead,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-massive-rally-031552862.html,1680664552,STORY,"['BAC', 'GE', 'DE', 'FCX', 'RVNC', 'ON', 'M']","[Well-known investment advisor Ed Yardeni believes that U.S. stocks are poised to rally this year. Speaking to CNBC last week, Yardeni said that the banking mini-crisis will be “very well-contained” by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). He noted that the banks’ issues should prevent the Fed from raising interest rates further and that he thinks the S&amp;P 500 could surge to 4,600 by the end of this year — a 12% rise from here. If you share Yardeni’s bullish outlook — as I do — it’s time to think about stocks to buy for a market rally.With many investors looking for a recession that probably won’t materialize, I believe growth stocks that are highly leveraged to the American economy are a good bet. But given the elevated interest rate environment and the cautiousness of many investors, I would avoid names with stratospheric valuations unless they have strong disruptive potential.The seven names below stand to benefit from stronger-than-expected economic growth and are reasonably valued stocks to buy for a market rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGEGeneral Electric$95.05RVNCRevance Therapeutics$33.41ONON Semiconductor$78.49DEDeere &amp; Company$397.66MMacy’s$18.92FCXFreeport-McMoRan$40.26CLFCleveland-Cliffs$17.49General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of the world’s largest and most-diversified industrial companies. I’ve included it on today’s list of stocks to buy for a market rally for two reasons.The first is that the company is poised to benefit from strong demand for travel given its huge aircraft engine business.Travel has made a full comeback, with spending in March up 9% year over year and 5% from 2019 levels, according to the U.S. Travel Association. While international travel spending remains below pre-pandemic levels, it is improving. Further, more than half of Americans said they are planning to prioritize leisure travel spending. And additional research by the Global Business Travel Association suggests business travel is expected to pick up this year as well.Story continuesRobust travel demand has led to airlines ordering more planes. Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSY) are the only large passenger aircraft manufacturers in the world, and GE counts both as customers. Thanks to a 26% jump in orders for its aerospace division in Q4, revenue for the segment was up 25% year over year. And as Seeking Alpha’s Rob Williams recently noted, shares popped to multiyear highs after management said this demand would drive revenue for years to come, including double-digit growth this year.The other reason I like GE stock here is that the company’s Grid Solutions unit has a great deal of growth ahead of it. The segment provides “power utilities and industries worldwide with equipment, systems and services to bring power reliably and efficiently from the point of generation to end power consumer.”Already this year, GE has won a multi-million-dollar contract from the Nepal Electricity Authority to strengthen the country’s power transmission network. Further, two “GE-led consortiums” were awarded five multiyear contracts to build high-voltage direct current systems for wind power generation in the Netherlands and Germany.GE stock is up 45% so far this year. Despite its recent rally, shares change hands for a very reasonable 17.5 times trailing operating cash flow.Revance Therapeutics (RVNC)Close-up portrait of her she nice-looking attractive lovely charming feminine confident straight-haired girl touching face collagen botox nourishing isolated over gray pastel color background. RVNC stockSource: Roman Samborskyi / Shutterstock.comRevance Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RVNC) has developed an injection called Daxxify that combats frown lines. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September, the product has emerged as a competitor to Botox. The big selling point for Daxxify is that it lasts six months, about twice as long as Botox.The company reported Q4 results in late February. Revenue surged 92% year over year to $49.9 million. The increase was partially driven by Daxxify, which generated strong sales even before its commercial launch at the end of last month.“[W]e’ve been very pleased with the strong initial uptake and positive feedback from both injectors and consumers,” said Revance Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Foley during the company’s Q4 earnings call.Following the release of the quarterly results, Barclays reiterated its “overweight” rating on RVNC stock and raised its price target to $40 from $37, saying it offers a compelling risk/reward proposition. The new target implies upside of 20% from current levels.As the economy strengthens, consumers will have more disposable income to pay for things like Daxxify. I believe the company’s $2.8 billion market capitalization far understates its value given the vast potential of Daxxify.ON Semiconductor (ON)a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. Semiconductor stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOn Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a chipmaker that’s highly leveraged to the automotive and industrial end markets, both of which are growing rapidly. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2022, those two end markets generated about 83% of On’s total sales.Fueled by electrification and the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), On’s revenue from its automotive customers is expected to grow at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2021 to 2025, while its industrial revenue is poised to increase at a CAGR of 7%.In a March 7 discussion with an analyst, On CEO Hassane El-Khoury noted, “We’ve had strong last couple of years, and we see that strength sustaining.”On March 8, Bank of America increased its price target for ON stock to $100 from $90, citing El-Khoury’s comments along with a new deal that the company signed to supply BMW (OTC:BMWYY) with chips for its EVs. The new target is more than 27% above the current share price.Finally, ON stock is changing hands at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.5, representing a discount to its five-year average P/E of 31.Deere &amp; Company (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), a leading maker and marketer of farm machinery,  is poised to benefit from two important trends: continued high food prices and Washington’s huge infrastructure spending.Because of high food prices, farmers in America and other countries are “in the money,” as they say, enabling them to pay high prices for Deere’s farm machinery and upgrade their machinery often.On the infrastructure front, Investor’s Business Daily contributor Michael Molinski pointed out in December that Deere should benefit from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, since the company sells a significant amount of construction equipment. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes billions of dollars for renewable energy and mining projects, should drive sales of the company’s mining and other equipment.Also likely to work in Deere’s favor in 2023 is the normalization of supply chains, as this headwind was a drag on the company’s financial results last year. Finally, Deere is a play on artificial intelligence (AI), one of the year’s hottest trends, with its development of “fully autonomous” tractors.Analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 13.4% to $54.4 billion this year and for earnings to increase by 31% to $30.49 per share. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the company exceed these levels. DE’s construction unit, in particular, should benefit from stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comMacy’s (NYSE:M) is a good way to play several important macro trends. These include U.S. economic growth that’s likely to beat expectations, continued strength in the labor market and increasing consumer discretionary spending.The retailer reported Q4 results on March 2.

In the case of FCX, the copper miner is well-positioned to benefit from U.S. economic growth, the energy transition, America’s onshoring trend and the electrification of transportation. Additionally, the reopening of China’s economy bodes very well for FCX stock.Last month, Goldman Sachs called its outlook for copper “extraordinarily positive” due to record-low inventories and supply that’s likely to peak next year.  The bank expects copper prices to reach $10,500 a ton in the near term and $15,000 a ton in the longer term, up from around $8,900 a ton currently.Even more upbeat is Trafigura. On March 20, the copper trader said prices could hit $12,000 per ton within a year due to a shortage of the metal.Higher copper prices translate into more profits for Freeport McMoran and its shareholders.Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)the Cleveland-Cliffs stock) logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comSteelmaker Cleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) is another name that will benefit from stronger-than-expected American economic growth.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.32bUS$6.41bUS$5.05bUS$3.89bUS$3.91bUS$3.44bUS$3.17bUS$3.02bUS$2.93bUS$2.89bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -12.00%Est @ -7.78%Est @ -4.82%Est @ -2.76%Est @ -1.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% US$8.5kUS$5.3kUS$3.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.4kUS$2.0kUS$1.6kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.8%– 2.1%) = US$38bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$38b÷ ( 1 + 9.8%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$45b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$133, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.307. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Valero Energy (VLO).Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Valero Energy, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is VLO Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $24.40.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Valero Energy may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The settlement requires Valero to continue to implement safety improvements through June 2025.The federal regulation that the EPA says the company violated, the Clean Air Act, requires industrial and chemical facilities that store large amounts of hazardous substances develop a risk management plan to reduce the risk of accidental releases.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.We also note that PSX holds a PEG ratio of 0.35. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.58. Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.58.Finally, we should also recognize that PSX has a P/CF ratio of 3.68. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PSX's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.23. Over the past 52 weeks, PSX's P/CF has been as high as 11.91 and as low as 3.23, with a median of 4.45.Investors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Valero Energy are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 5.73 and a PEG ratio of 0.96 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 5.82 and 0.58, respectively.Story continuesOver the past year, VLO's P/E has been as high as 12.62, as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.29; its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.10, as low as 0.73, with a median of 0.58 during the same time period.Additionally, Valero Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.86 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.25. For VLO, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.70, with a median of 2.01 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Phillips 66 and Valero Energy are likely undervalued currently.

The company’s refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. Valero, with ownership interests in 15 petroleum refineries, has a combined throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day.Valero boasts that its premium refining operations are resilient even when the business operating environment is carbon-constrained. Its refining business has the capabilities to generate handsome cashflows, which will allow it to return capital to shareholders and back growth projects.Valero’s renewable diesel segment involves the Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture, which is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America. The joint venture is between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero. Low-carbon fuel policies across the globe are primarily aiding the demand for renewable diesel, driving Valero’s Renewable Diesel business.With the commissioning of the DGD Port Arthur facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, DGD’s combined renewable diesel production capacity increased by 470 million gallons per year to 1.2 billion gallons per year. In 2023, Valero’s renewable diesel margins are expected to be consistent with the current levels.Valero’s board of directors approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend from 98 cents per share to $1.02. The dividend hike raises the company’s annualized cash dividend rate to $4.08 per share.Valero’s commitment to the energy transition is commendable. The company is on track to reduce and displace Refinery GHG emissions by 63% through investments in board-approved projects by 2025. Hence, Valero is actively investing in low-carbon businesses such as biofuels, renewable diesel and wind power generation.Story continuesOther Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that also presently carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cactus, Inc. WHD reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. Strong quarterly earnings were primarily driven by increased drilling activity by customers, offset partially by higher total expenses.At the fourth-quarter end, Cactus had cash and cash equivalents of $344.5 million, which can provide it with immense financial flexibility. Cactus had no bank debt outstanding as of Dec 31, 2022.Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s MPC adjusted earnings per share of $6.65 comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54. The bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and another $700 million worth of shares from the start of this year till Jan 27. Marathon Petroleum, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Phillips 66 PSX reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $4 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.34. Lower-than-expected quarterly earnings were driven by lower contributions from the Chemicals segment. The negatives were partially offset by strong refining margins worldwide.Phillips 66 received approval from the board of directors to hike its dividend. The new quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share reflects an increase of 8.2% from the previous quarter’s 97 cents and a 14% hike from the year-ago quarter’s 92 cents.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +179.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.23 points to a change of -16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.45 indicates a change of -32.1% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -14.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $147.03 billion and $135.86 billion estimates indicate -16.6% and -7.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.04%. The EPS surprise was +13.42%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

393,6e3f6351-8950-3d00-bb66-0f1d44301ed3,UNH,2023-04-08,UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-unh-earnings-expected-140002116.html,1680876002,STORY,['UNH'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.8%.Revenues are expected to be $89.43 billion, up 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth?For UnitedHealth, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of $5.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.34, delivering a surprise of +3.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.UnitedHealth doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to UNH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?UnitedHealth Group's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at UnitedHealth Group's main business drivers.UnitedHealth Group, Inc. provides a wide range of health care products and services, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.UnitedHealth has the largest and most diverse membership base within the managed-care organization market, which gives it significant competitive advantages. It has built its prescription drug business through OptumRx division, with the acquisition of Catamaran. The company has acquired a number of competing healthcare providers. These acquisitions have transformed it from a pure health insurer to a comprehensive healthcare provider.UnitedHealth consists of two business platforms - UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Its strategy is to meld the provision of medical care from its Optum unit with UnitedHealthcare brand insurance products, which help in cross-selling products and services. The company is consistently working toward expanding both these units to reach more clients, in turn boosting its growth possibilities. Within these platforms are included the four reportable segments of UNH – UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.UnitedHealthcare (contributed 77% of revenues in 2022) is divided into UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual; UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement; UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State and UnitedHealthcare Global. This segment is responsible for providing health care benefits globally. It serves individuals as well as employers. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries consist a large chunk of its client list.Optum (23%) is a technology-enabled health services business serving the broad health care marketplace, including those who need care: the consumers who need the right support, information, resources and products; those who provide care: pharmacies, hospitals, physicians, practices and other health care facilities. The platform is divided into three segments - OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in UnitedHealth Group a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $8,200.16, or a 720.02% gain, as of April 6, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 163.34% and the price of gold increased 22.92% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for UNH.UnitedHealth Group’s top line remains well-poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. Revenues for 2023 are predicted to lie within $357-$360 billion. We expect the top line to grow 10.2% year over year in 2023. Its solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated in the $24.40-$24.90 band in 2023, the mid-point of which indicates an 11.1% rise from the 2022 figure. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments. Its shares have outperformed the industry year to date. However, the membership in its global business continues to decline. Rising operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 8.21%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

397,37a613c8-42d8-3dc9-9b85-a7e47c72267c,REG,2023-04-08,5 Reasons to Add Regency Centers (REG) to Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-add-regency-centers-130301282.html,1680786181,STORY,"['REG', 'FRT']","[The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry.Given this backdrop, Regency Centers Corp.’s REG portfolio of premium shopping centers in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States, having strong growth drivers, positions it well for growth. Also, an encouraging development pipeline and balance-sheet strength bode well.Regency’s fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent. Management expects 2023 NAREIT funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of $4.03-$4.11.Analysts seem bullish on this Jacksonville, FL-based Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has moved marginally upward over the past month to $4.08.Shares of REG have lost 3.6% in the past three months compared with its industry's fall of 3.1%. Nonetheless, given its robust fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead. Hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes Regency Centers a Solid Pick?Solid Industry Fundamentals: Regency’s premium shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near the urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. With more people moving into the suburbs due to post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is likely to benefit as the best-in-class operators are opening new locations in high-quality centers.Focus on Grocery-Anchored Shopping Centers: REG’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. Its portfolio comprises 80% of the grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.Also, its portfolio has a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers. Of the top 10 tenants, six are high-performing grocers. This assures a stable revenue generation for the company.Acquisitions &amp; Development: To enhance its portfolio, REG has been making acquisitions and developments in key markets of the United States. In 2022, the company’s acquisitions totaled $210 million (at Regency’s share), encompassing 1.15 million gross leasable area.Moreover, REG has an encouraging development pipeline. As of Dec 31, 2022, its in-process development and redevelopment projects had estimated net project costs of $301 million (at the company’s share). So far, it has incurred 51% of the costs. Management anticipates incurring $130 million of development and redevelopment spend for 2023. Such efforts bode well for the company’s long-term growth.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Regency maintains a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity and a low leverage level. As of Dec 31, 2022, it had full capacity under its $1.2-billion revolving credit facility, a pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio of 5.0 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7.Also, its investment grade credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 with stable outlooks from S&amp;P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, REG is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.REG’s current cash flow growth is projected at 21.54% compared with the 14.01% estimated for the industry. Moreover, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 7.59% compared with the industry’s average of 5.65%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Regency remains committed to that. Since 2014, this retail REIT has steadily increased its dividend payments and continued with its payments even during the pandemic.In November 2022, concurrent with its third-quarter earnings release, Regency Centers increased the quarterly cash dividend payment on its common stock from 62.50 cents per share to 65 cents, marking a 4% rise.Given the company’s solid operating platform, the scope for growth and a decent financial position compared to the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Urstadt Biddle Properties UBA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share is pegged at $6.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty Trust’s 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $1.64.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Urstadt Biddle Properties’ current-year FFO per share is pegged at $1.60.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:EL) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-120037347.html,1680868837,STORY,['EL'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$281 and falling to the lows of US$235. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Estée Lauder Companies' current trading price of US$241 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Is Estée Lauder Companies Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 57.72x is currently well-above the industry average of 18.37x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Estée Lauder Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Estée Lauder Companies look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Estée Lauder Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe EL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EL for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for EL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Estée Lauder Companies as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

401,3f76787c-15f7-3ca8-99d5-a45e402f74af,PG,2023-04-08,The 15 Best Teeth Whitening Products of 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-best-teeth-whitening-products-110400765.html,1680865440,STORY,"['PG', 'GSK']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best teeth whitening products of 2023. For more products, head on over to 5 Best Teeth Whitening Products of 2023. Oral health is one of the most important yet often overlooked aspects of human health. After all, our survival and growth depends on the ability to eat food, and a healthy mouth is essential for a healthy diet as well. Dental diseases are also often some of the most ignored illnesses that most people face, despite dentists repeatedly warning people to be on the lookout for any changes inside their mouths. While most people think that brushing their teeth regularly is all that it takes to maintain proper oral health, dentists often recommend twice a year checkups as well as regular deep cleaning to ensure that the mouth remains healthy.At the same time, keeping the mouth clean isn't only necessary to avoid gum diseases and other localized illnesses. You'd be surprised to learn that mouth problems are often associated with other illnesses as well. Don't believe us? Well, a study from Harvard University illustrates that plaque on the teeth can be directly related to plaque in the arteries. Coronary heart disease is caused by plaque building inside blood vessels which is called atherosclerosis, while plaque buildup on the teeth is dubbed periodontal disease.Researchers investigated the link between the two by feeding rabbits a diet high in cholesterol that can cause atherosclerosis. After this, they injected the furry creatures with a bacteria that cause periodontal diseases. Surprisingly, the introduction of this bacteria caused plaque buildup in the arteries of the rabbits as well, which was higher than the buildup in the arteries of rabbits that were kept as part of a control test sample. To investigate whether both gum and heart diseases can also be cured at the same time, the animals were treated with a liquid that fights inflammation. This treatment reduced both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in the rabbit, hinting that the two might have a stronger connection than initially believed.Story continuesGum disease really is a menacing illness that is also linked to diabetes. According to the U.K.'s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, high levels of glucose in the blood can inflate the soft tissues around the teeth. This inflammation can lead to gum disease which if left untreated can cause the teeth to fall out. Other mouth diseases caused by diabetes include dry mouth, thrush, and burning mouth syndrome.Economically speaking, another little known fact about dental diseases is that they result in billions of dollars spent each year for treatment. The U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information's National Library of Medicine believes that the aggregated economic burden of periodontal disease in the U.S. stood at $3.49 billion and in Europe at EUR2.52 billion in 2018. These costs are just the tip of the iceberg, as the same body estimates that the indirect costs of periodontal disease were a whopping $150 billion in America and 156 billion Euros in Europe. What this means is that the diseases caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses that might have been avoidableThese losses are not limited only to the costs spent in treating the illnesses. As anyone who has experienced wisdom tooth pain can attest to, it becomes near impossible to properly function when the pain is at its peak. This causes a loss in productivity, and according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), oral diseases cause over $45 billion in productivity losses each year. At the same time, they also lead to tens of millions of lost hours in school time and prevent a significant proportion of adults from efficiently securing a job as the CDC outlines that almost 18% of working age adults report that mouth and teeth appearances impact their ability to give a job interview. Summing these costs up, the CDC estimates that dental care costs America a whopping $136 billion annually -  a figure that isn't too off from the Library of Medicine's data that we've shared above.The Oral Care IndustryWithin the oral care market, there are a variety of different segments. While some concern themselves with disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, others are for cosmetic products that enhance the user's appearance. One such segment is the teeth whitening industry. Yellow teeth are a serious problem, as they are not only caused by stains from the nicotine in cigarettes or tea but can also indicate a thinning of the teeth's outer protective layer called the enamel. Within the industry itself, there are several products that range from toothpaste to gels and other devices. The industry is populated by both large and small players, with notable firms such as GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL).Research from Grand View Market Research suggests that this segment was worth $7.2 billion last year and adds that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% between then and 2030 to sit at an estimated $10.6 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the research firm, the primary reason behind the industry's growth is a higher disposable income in developing countries, which has enabled people living over there to access better healthcare products. It also outlines that celebrities are also causing people to chase after the elusive perfect smile, with teeth whitening being the most popular dental procedure in the U.S. Finally, Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing market segment due to the reasons mentioned above. As of the last year, North America was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for a 37% market share.Best Teeth Whitening Products of 2023Solis Images/Shutterstock.comWith all these details in mind, let's now jump ahead to some of the best teeth whitening products that you can find.Our Methodology We cast a wide net in our hunt for the best teeth whitening product.

Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter.The company’s organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.However, Procter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts that have hurt margins.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.01%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.91%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest airline had lost 16.28% over the past month, lagging the Transportation sector's loss of 5.69% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.24% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from American Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.03, up 101.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.26 billion, up 37.76% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.47 per share and revenue of $53.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +394% and +9.66%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for American Airlines. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

After being battered in 2020 and 2021, with economic activities shrinking drastically, the fortunes of sector participants turned out for the better in 2022. Economic activities started bouncing back following the easing of the pandemic-induced restrictions. The scenario continues to be buoyant in 2023.UpsidesWithin the sector, the airline industry is witnessing increased passengers, with a continued rise in air-travel demand. The bright scenario is highlighted by data provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) with respect to passenger volumes. In the first quarter of 2023  (January-March period), TSA checkpoint numbers revealed that passenger volumes not only surpassed the 2022 levels but also exceeded the 2019 (pre-coronavirus) numbers on many days.It is hardly surprising that the pace of growth of e-commerce demand has slowed from the levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic. Despite the slowdown, as economies re-open, the same has been impressive, driven by the convenience associated with online shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth.  E-commerce demand strength should continue to support growth of industry players. Favorable pricing also bears good news for industry participants.With economic activities gaining pace, more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile through dividends and buybacks to pacify the long-suffering shareholders, thereby underlining their financial strength and confidence in their businesses. For example, recently, FedEx Corporation’s FDX board of directors approved a dividend hike of 10%, thereby raising its quarterly cash dividend from $1.15 ($4.60 annualized) per share to $1.26 ($5.04 annualized).3 Transportation Stocks to Buy NowWith the first-quarter 2023 earnings season around the corner, we have highlighted three stocks —American Airlines AAL, Copa Holdings CPA and FedEx — from the Transportation sector. The companies carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThese companies have witnessed impressive earnings estimate revisions for the current year. Also, all the above-mentioned stocks have outperformed the sector with respect to price in the first quarter of this 2023. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Copa Holdings: The company is benefiting from the improvement in air-travel demand. In fourth-quarter 2022, passenger revenues increased 29.5% due to higher yields. CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging as well. In fourth-quarter 2022, cargo and mail revenues grew 69%, owing to higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable.The above-mentioned tailwinds are likely to continue aiding this Latin American carrier that currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised 12.3% upward over the past 60 days.American Airlines: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is seeing a steady recovery in domestic air-travel demand. AAL has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s current-year earnings has improved 19.6% over the past 60 days. AAL delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.79%, on average.FedEx: The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is being well served by its cost-cutting efforts. The cost-saving endeavors are driving its bottom line amid weakening demand. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well.FDX’s management expects earnings per share between $14.6 and $15.2 for 2023 (prior to MTM retirement plans accounting for adjustments, and excluding estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives and costs related to business realignment activities). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FDX’s current-year earnings has improved 6.9% over the past 60 days.

(AAL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-group-inc-aal-130001668.html,1680786001,STORY,['AAL'],"[American Airlines (AAL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest airline have returned -16.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which American Airlines belongs, has lost 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, American Airlines is expected to post earnings of $0.03 per share, indicating a change of +101.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +13.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.47 points to a change of +394% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.88 indicates a change of +16.8% from what American Airlines is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for American Airlines.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of American Airlines, the consensus sales estimate of $12.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +37.8%. The $53.7 billion and $55.77 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.7% and +3.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Airlines reported revenues of $13.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.9%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with -$1.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, American Airlines surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Airlines is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Airlines. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

411,4d6db96c-9e4c-3f31-85e6-22d9df8e29d3,ETN,2023-04-08,Leveraging Financial Tools To Meet Corporate Sustainability Goals,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leveraging-financial-tools-meet-corporate-132000330.html,1680873600,STORY,['ETN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 7, 2023 / EatonEaton, Friday, April 7, 2023, Press release pictureThere's no denying the threat of climate change. We see the evidence all around us, with the last three years bringing record numbers of natural disasters in the U.S. Mitigating the effects of climate change in the future will require large-scale efforts to build a more sustainable society.Corporations have a responsibility to act on this now - not only to mitigate risk and meet potential new regulations, but also to ensure their own long-term success. Mission-driven companies today recognize that what's good for society is also good for business.What these companies may not recognize is the opportunity their finance teams have to play a key role in helping mitigate the risks of climate change. Finance teams have the capability to make a strong impact by offering advice around making smart investments that also drive the organization's sustainability strategy.At Eaton, we're exploring new ways that financial strategies can help us fulfill our mission, to improve the quality of life and the environment through the use of power management technologies and services. That includes looking at how we finance our company, how we run our operations, and how we help our customers finance their own operations.We're exploring new ways that financial strategies can help us meet our sustainability goals - in how we finance our company, how we run our operations, and how we help our customers finance power management solutions - and ultimately deliver on our mission to protect the environment and improve lives.Kirsten Park, Senior Vice President, TreasuryCorporate financing tools and impact investingBoth equity and fixed income investors are more focused on sustainability than ever before. They're judging companies by ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance because they recognize these metrics are mission critical. Investors are also seeing how financing options have the power to drive change and uncover new opportunities for companies to both meet their ESG goals and develop new revenue streams. Specifically, debt instruments have expanded to include green financing options.Story continuesOne example is a sustainability-linked bond, a form of debt capital that is tied to the issuer's sustainability performance. With this type of debt, there's a direct link between how well the company performs against its selected sustainability metrics and the amount of interest the company pays. A key component is meeting measurable targets, such as reducing scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are aligned with the company's sustainability strategy. Other metrics for sustainability-linked bonds can include scope 3 GHG emissions, biodiversity protection, waste reduction, gender diversity and more.At Eaton, we recently issued our first $1.3 billion sustainability-linked bond. The notes are linked to our goal to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and mark an exciting step forward for our commitment to science-backed targets to mitigate climate change. As our Chief Sustainability Officer Harold Jones noted when the bond was announced, ""Achieving our sustainability goals is as critical to our business as meeting our financial commitments, and this financing aligns both strategies.""Financing sustainable operationsAnother way finance can support an organization's sustainability goals is by partnering with procurement and other functions to invest in energy efficiency projects and source renewable energy to power its operations and reduce carbon emissions.At Eaton, we've set a carbon roadmap with six levers to help us achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. As part of that, we're prioritizing the use of renewable energy wherever possible. We buy renewable energy where available and have also installed solar projects in many of our sites to produce our own renewable energy.Still, there are places where onsite or physically purchased renewable energy isn't available. That's where Virtual Purchase Power Agreements (VPPAs) can help ensure the continued acceleration of renewable energy.VPPAs allow companies to scale-up their renewable sources of energy by investing in utility-scale renewable energy generation while accelerating energy optimization and efficiency in their operations. VPPAs are often a better solution than ""buying your way"" to carbon reduction through other mechanisms. They enable organizations to put renewable energy on the grid that wouldn't have existed otherwise, which is a critical step forward in accelerating the world's movement to renewable energy.Helping customers finance sustainable solutionsBeyond running their own operations sustainably, companies can accelerate change by impacting customer behavior - and finance has a role to play here as well. In an era of elevated energy prices, customers are increasingly looking to invest in technology that will help them reduce energy costs and ensure business continuity. Energy storage, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure can help achieve these goals - but they also have high upfront costs.Tailored finance solutions can help customers make the investment in their own sustainable solutions while preserving cash flow. Eaton recently launched a finance solution with BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions to offer a predictable fixed payment that includes infrastructure and equipment, as well as access to Eaton's global service network. This will enable businesses to reap additional cost-savings while starting the important work of reducing their carbon footprint.Finance teams as drivers of transparency - and catalysts for changeMeasurement and transparency are key to driving progress on our sustainability commitments. And this is another area where finance has a critical role to play. Just as public companies have a responsibility to report transparently on financial performance, they also should report transparently on their sustainability progress.Finance teams, with their expertise in measurement and focus on accountability, are natural partners. Finance can surface new tools in the form of financing strategies to achieve sustainability goals and provide leadership on oversight and accountability.At Eaton, we report our progress via our Sustainability Dashboard and work with trusted ESG ratings agencies like Sustainalytics, MSCI, ISS and others to transparently share our key metrics. In addition, we pioneered the creation of a standalone TCFD report to publish our performance against objective third-party metrics set by The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). And our finance function provides direct oversight of key sustainability initiatives, such as the investment of $3 billion in research and development we are making to support the development of sustainable product solutions.Meeting the moment on climate change requires all of us to row in the same direction. And finance teams are helping to steer the organization. By establishing powerful cross-functional collaborations with their finance teams, companies can accelerate the execution of their sustainability strategies and effectively report on their progress. Investors can be assured that an organization's promises are backed up by real action. And all of society can move toward a more sustainable future.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/eatonEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EatonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/748116/Leveraging-Financial-Tools-To-Meet-Corporate-Sustainability-Goals]"

413,37a613c8-42d8-3dc9-9b85-a7e47c72267c,FRT,2023-04-08,5 Reasons to Add Regency Centers (REG) to Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-add-regency-centers-130301282.html,1680786181,STORY,"['REG', 'FRT']","[The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry.Given this backdrop, Regency Centers Corp.’s REG portfolio of premium shopping centers in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States, having strong growth drivers, positions it well for growth. Also, an encouraging development pipeline and balance-sheet strength bode well.Regency’s fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent. Management expects 2023 NAREIT funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of $4.03-$4.11.Analysts seem bullish on this Jacksonville, FL-based Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has moved marginally upward over the past month to $4.08.Shares of REG have lost 3.6% in the past three months compared with its industry's fall of 3.1%. Nonetheless, given its robust fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead. Hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes Regency Centers a Solid Pick?Solid Industry Fundamentals: Regency’s premium shopping centers are situated in affluent suburban areas and near the urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. With more people moving into the suburbs due to post-pandemic migration and the hybrid work setup, Regency’s suburban-shopping-center portfolio is likely to benefit as the best-in-class operators are opening new locations in high-quality centers.Focus on Grocery-Anchored Shopping Centers: REG’s focus on necessity, service, convenience and value retailers serving the essential needs of the communities provides it with an unequaled strategic advantage. Its portfolio comprises 80% of the grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. This ensures dependable traffic and allows the company to bank on its grocery centers during uncertain times.Also, its portfolio has a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers. Of the top 10 tenants, six are high-performing grocers. This assures a stable revenue generation for the company.Acquisitions &amp; Development: To enhance its portfolio, REG has been making acquisitions and developments in key markets of the United States. In 2022, the company’s acquisitions totaled $210 million (at Regency’s share), encompassing 1.15 million gross leasable area.Moreover, REG has an encouraging development pipeline. As of Dec 31, 2022, its in-process development and redevelopment projects had estimated net project costs of $301 million (at the company’s share). So far, it has incurred 51% of the costs. Management anticipates incurring $130 million of development and redevelopment spend for 2023. Such efforts bode well for the company’s long-term growth.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Regency maintains a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity and a low leverage level. As of Dec 31, 2022, it had full capacity under its $1.2-billion revolving credit facility, a pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDAre ratio of 5.0 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7.Also, its investment grade credit ratings of BBB+/Baa1 with stable outlooks from S&amp;P Global and Moody's, respectively, render it favorable access to the debt market. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, REG is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.REG’s current cash flow growth is projected at 21.54% compared with the 14.01% estimated for the industry. Moreover, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 7.59% compared with the industry’s average of 5.65%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and Regency remains committed to that. Since 2014, this retail REIT has steadily increased its dividend payments and continued with its payments even during the pandemic.In November 2022, concurrent with its third-quarter earnings release, Regency Centers increased the quarterly cash dividend payment on its common stock from 62.50 cents per share to 65 cents, marking a 4% rise.Given the company’s solid operating platform, the scope for growth and a decent financial position compared to the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Urstadt Biddle Properties UBA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s ongoing year’s FFO per share is pegged at $6.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty Trust’s 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $1.64.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Urstadt Biddle Properties’ current-year FFO per share is pegged at $1.60.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

414,c26a2f48-d650-3680-a712-f4ca21063818,SHW,2023-04-08,Should You Be Impressed By The Sherwin-Williams Company's (NYSE:SHW) ROE?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impressed-sherwin-williams-companys-nyse-130020767.html,1680786020,STORY,['SHW'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:65% = US$2.0b ÷ US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.65.Does Sherwin-Williams Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sherwin-Williams has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the Chemicals industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Sherwin-Williams.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Sherwin-Williams' Debt And Its 65% Return On EquityWe think Sherwin-Williams uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 3.41. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

This compares to earnings of $0.38 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 23.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this specialty chemicals company would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.10, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.RPM International , which belongs to the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry, posted revenues of $1.52 billion for the quarter ended February 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.49%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.43 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.RPM International shares have lost about 13.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for RPM International?While RPM International has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for RPM International: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.48 on $2.03 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.35 on $7.22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Paints and Related Products is currently in the bottom 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on April 25.This paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.9%.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.47 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 21, 2023.FCX has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.83%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43.FCX is just one of a large group of Basic Materials stocks with a positive ESP figure. United States Steel (X) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on April 27, 2023, United States Steel holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.64 a share 20 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for United States Steel is $0.49, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 30.47%.Story continuesFCX and X's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

418,d1ee5ab1-d332-3f03-a343-6eea6f24f461,FCX,2023-04-08,7 Stocks to Buy for the Massive Rally Ahead,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-massive-rally-031552862.html,1680664552,STORY,"['BAC', 'GE', 'DE', 'FCX', 'RVNC', 'ON', 'M']","[Well-known investment advisor Ed Yardeni believes that U.S. stocks are poised to rally this year. Speaking to CNBC last week, Yardeni said that the banking mini-crisis will be “very well-contained” by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). He noted that the banks’ issues should prevent the Fed from raising interest rates further and that he thinks the S&amp;P 500 could surge to 4,600 by the end of this year — a 12% rise from here. If you share Yardeni’s bullish outlook — as I do — it’s time to think about stocks to buy for a market rally.With many investors looking for a recession that probably won’t materialize, I believe growth stocks that are highly leveraged to the American economy are a good bet. But given the elevated interest rate environment and the cautiousness of many investors, I would avoid names with stratospheric valuations unless they have strong disruptive potential.The seven names below stand to benefit from stronger-than-expected economic growth and are reasonably valued stocks to buy for a market rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGEGeneral Electric$95.05RVNCRevance Therapeutics$33.41ONON Semiconductor$78.49DEDeere &amp; Company$397.66MMacy’s$18.92FCXFreeport-McMoRan$40.26CLFCleveland-Cliffs$17.49General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is one of the world’s largest and most-diversified industrial companies. I’ve included it on today’s list of stocks to buy for a market rally for two reasons.The first is that the company is poised to benefit from strong demand for travel given its huge aircraft engine business.Travel has made a full comeback, with spending in March up 9% year over year and 5% from 2019 levels, according to the U.S. Travel Association. While international travel spending remains below pre-pandemic levels, it is improving. Further, more than half of Americans said they are planning to prioritize leisure travel spending. And additional research by the Global Business Travel Association suggests business travel is expected to pick up this year as well.Story continuesRobust travel demand has led to airlines ordering more planes. Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSY) are the only large passenger aircraft manufacturers in the world, and GE counts both as customers. Thanks to a 26% jump in orders for its aerospace division in Q4, revenue for the segment was up 25% year over year. And as Seeking Alpha’s Rob Williams recently noted, shares popped to multiyear highs after management said this demand would drive revenue for years to come, including double-digit growth this year.The other reason I like GE stock here is that the company’s Grid Solutions unit has a great deal of growth ahead of it. The segment provides “power utilities and industries worldwide with equipment, systems and services to bring power reliably and efficiently from the point of generation to end power consumer.”Already this year, GE has won a multi-million-dollar contract from the Nepal Electricity Authority to strengthen the country’s power transmission network. Further, two “GE-led consortiums” were awarded five multiyear contracts to build high-voltage direct current systems for wind power generation in the Netherlands and Germany.GE stock is up 45% so far this year. Despite its recent rally, shares change hands for a very reasonable 17.5 times trailing operating cash flow.Revance Therapeutics (RVNC)Close-up portrait of her she nice-looking attractive lovely charming feminine confident straight-haired girl touching face collagen botox nourishing isolated over gray pastel color background. RVNC stockSource: Roman Samborskyi / Shutterstock.comRevance Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RVNC) has developed an injection called Daxxify that combats frown lines. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September, the product has emerged as a competitor to Botox. The big selling point for Daxxify is that it lasts six months, about twice as long as Botox.The company reported Q4 results in late February. Revenue surged 92% year over year to $49.9 million. The increase was partially driven by Daxxify, which generated strong sales even before its commercial launch at the end of last month.“[W]e’ve been very pleased with the strong initial uptake and positive feedback from both injectors and consumers,” said Revance Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Foley during the company’s Q4 earnings call.Following the release of the quarterly results, Barclays reiterated its “overweight” rating on RVNC stock and raised its price target to $40 from $37, saying it offers a compelling risk/reward proposition. The new target implies upside of 20% from current levels.As the economy strengthens, consumers will have more disposable income to pay for things like Daxxify. I believe the company’s $2.8 billion market capitalization far understates its value given the vast potential of Daxxify.ON Semiconductor (ON)a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. Semiconductor stocks to buySource: ShutterstockOn Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a chipmaker that’s highly leveraged to the automotive and industrial end markets, both of which are growing rapidly. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2022, those two end markets generated about 83% of On’s total sales.Fueled by electrification and the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), On’s revenue from its automotive customers is expected to grow at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2021 to 2025, while its industrial revenue is poised to increase at a CAGR of 7%.In a March 7 discussion with an analyst, On CEO Hassane El-Khoury noted, “We’ve had strong last couple of years, and we see that strength sustaining.”On March 8, Bank of America increased its price target for ON stock to $100 from $90, citing El-Khoury’s comments along with a new deal that the company signed to supply BMW (OTC:BMWYY) with chips for its EVs. The new target is more than 27% above the current share price.Finally, ON stock is changing hands at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.5, representing a discount to its five-year average P/E of 31.Deere &amp; Company (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comDeere &amp; Company (NYSE:DE), a leading maker and marketer of farm machinery,  is poised to benefit from two important trends: continued high food prices and Washington’s huge infrastructure spending.Because of high food prices, farmers in America and other countries are “in the money,” as they say, enabling them to pay high prices for Deere’s farm machinery and upgrade their machinery often.On the infrastructure front, Investor’s Business Daily contributor Michael Molinski pointed out in December that Deere should benefit from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, since the company sells a significant amount of construction equipment. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes billions of dollars for renewable energy and mining projects, should drive sales of the company’s mining and other equipment.Also likely to work in Deere’s favor in 2023 is the normalization of supply chains, as this headwind was a drag on the company’s financial results last year. Finally, Deere is a play on artificial intelligence (AI), one of the year’s hottest trends, with its development of “fully autonomous” tractors.Analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 13.4% to $54.4 billion this year and for earnings to increase by 31% to $30.49 per share. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the company exceed these levels. DE’s construction unit, in particular, should benefit from stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comMacy’s (NYSE:M) is a good way to play several important macro trends. These include U.S. economic growth that’s likely to beat expectations, continued strength in the labor market and increasing consumer discretionary spending.The retailer reported Q4 results on March 2. Adjusted earnings, excluding certain items, of $1.71 per share came in well above analysts’ average estimate of $1.57, while revenue of $8.3 billion was in line with estimates. While same-store sales were down 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, they were up 3.3% from the fourth quarter of 2019.In a note to investors on March 3, TD Cowen increased its price target on M stock to $29 from $27, implying upside of 53%. The bank noted Macy’s ability to meaningfully cut its inventories while “driving profitable sales growth and realizing strength in gifting occasion-wear beauty and luxury in 4Q inclusive of a better January,” according to The Fly.M stock is trading with a bargain basement trailing price-earnings ratio of 3.2 and has a sizeable dividend yield of 3.5%.Freeport McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comLike Macy’s Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX) is a play on multiple strong macro trends. In the case of FCX, the copper miner is well-positioned to benefit from U.S. economic growth, the energy transition, America’s onshoring trend and the electrification of transportation. Additionally, the reopening of China’s economy bodes very well for FCX stock.Last month, Goldman Sachs called its outlook for copper “extraordinarily positive” due to record-low inventories and supply that’s likely to peak next year.  The bank expects copper prices to reach $10,500 a ton in the near term and $15,000 a ton in the longer term, up from around $8,900 a ton currently.Even more upbeat is Trafigura. On March 20, the copper trader said prices could hit $12,000 per ton within a year due to a shortage of the metal.Higher copper prices translate into more profits for Freeport McMoran and its shareholders.Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)the Cleveland-Cliffs stock) logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comSteelmaker Cleveland Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) is another name that will benefit from stronger-than-expected American economic growth. In particular, CLF stock is likely to get a lift from better-than-expected auto sales, as the company is the “largest supplier of steel to the automotive sector,” according to S&amp;P Global.Cox Automotive notes strength in the new-vehicle market in 2023, with Q1 volume increasing more than 6% year over year. Meanwhile, automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) just reported deliveries soared 18% YOY in the first quarter.CLF will also be helped by the onshoring trend and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as it names “infrastructure” and “manufacturing” as two of its other important end markets.On April 3, Seeking Alpha noted the company has raised its spot market base prices five times already this year, indicating strong demand.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of GE and FCX.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Kanioura told Axios the company has spent ""hundreds of millions"" in recent years to do so.""PepsiCo has always been using technology to engage with our consumers,"" Kanioura said in a corporate fact sheet on the company’s AI initiatives in 2021.

The results of that analysis prompted the company to develop Off The Eaten Path seaweed snacks, a process that took less than a year.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPAnother example of AI-generated insights informing PepsiCo’s product development came when research found consumers were interested in immunity, which led it to start producing Propel Water with immunity-boosting ingredients, and the new product made it to store shelves six months later.PEPSI PRICE HIKES DRIVE PROFITSFrito-Lay, which is a subsidiary of PepsiCo that features Cheetos as part of its portfolio, has used AI to help ensure the product’s quality in taste and texture remains consistent.""We’ve trained a machine ‘brain’ to measure the Cheetos, look at them and detect when adjustments are needed,"" PepsiCo SVP Foods R&amp;D Denise Lefebvre said in the fact sheet. ""This is the ideal application for AI because we know really well what consumers love and value about Cheetos, and we can train a system to understand that.""Story continuesAnother use PepsiCo has considered for AI is helping it determine how to best utilize store shelves and space available for its merchandise at a given grocery or corner store.Magesh Bagavathi, PepsiCo SVP and chief technology officer, said in the fact sheet that a sales rep can take a video of a store’s shelves to create a map of what products need to be stocked.""You can immediately start tailoring products based on what sells in that region, based on events in that region,"" Bagavathi said. ""There are in-depth insights on seasonality and promotions. It’s highly customized and changes the way we plan.""]"

(NASDAQ:REGN)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-110042408.html,1680951642,STORY,['REGN'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is US$1,032 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityRegeneron Pharmaceuticals' US$829 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$872 analyst price target for REGN is 16% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.23bUS$4.19bUS$4.56bUS$4.87bUS$5.33bUS$5.66bUS$5.93bUS$6.17bUS$6.39bUS$6.58bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 6.12%Est @ 4.91%Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$4.0kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$141bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$141b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$73bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$110b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$829, the company appears about fair value at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

It is worth considering Regeneron (REGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.This biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 22.30%.For the most recent quarter, Regeneron was expected to post earnings of $9.68 per share, but it reported $12.56 per share instead, representing a surprise of 29.75%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $9.70 per share, while it actually produced $11.14 per share, a surprise of 14.85%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Regeneron. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Regeneron currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.78%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 4, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While living donors and recipients commonly travel long distances for transplant surgery at a specialized center, access to specialized pre- and post-testing and results reporting may be absent in their local community, potentially impeding living donation and a successful long-term outcome for recipients.To address these limitations, the new services expand on Quest's prior offering in transplant testing with new capabilities, including:New patient-customized information packets to help educate patients on the process and help Quest's phlebotomists fast-track testing--for results within 8-24 hours for some tests--for patients visiting one of Quest's 2,100 patient service centers.The option for at-home specimen collection from one of 5,000 mobile phlebotomists through ExamOne, a Quest Diagnostics company, for both transplant recipients and living donors.Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) Renal Risk Variant Genotyping, an advanced genetic test to help evaluate kidney disease risk for donors.Longitudinal tracking of viral loads test results according to specimen type within the EMR.Story continues""Access to fast and convenient transplant testing services is so vital for these vulnerable patient populations,"" said Elizabeth A. Cohen, PharmD, BCPS, Clinical Pharmacist and Manager of Transplant Quality, Compliance &amp; Research at Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Conn., which has piloted the Quest offering. ""Creating a better transplant testing journey means that we can meet the patients where they are and show that we are invested in their care. Given the barriers to testing we know some patients experience, working with Quest has expanded access through its national scale and improved the level of care we have been able to provide, to help us serve that mission.""Organ and tissue transplantation requires a battery of tests to identify infectious diseases in donors and recipients, determine match compatibility, such as through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, monitor transplant therapy response and identify rejection. As certain transplant therapies may suppress the immune system, testing is also crucial to identify pathogens to help prevent transmission from a donor. Transplant recipients can undergo as many as 500 tests over the course of their lifetime, while living donors may also receive several tests before and after a donation.Enabling the Growth of Living DonationIn 2021, over 6,500 transplants were performed in 2021 from living donors - an increase of 14.2 percent over 2020.1 Medical advances and less restrictive medical guidelines have opened opportunities for more individuals, including those diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV, to act as living donors (for transplant recipients already infected).Transplants from living donors versus cadavers are associated with more favorable outcomes, including lower risk of complications and shorter hospital stays post-surgery, and associated cost savings.""Our transplant solutions draw from Quest's differentiated strengths in advanced diagnostics, specialized service and nationwide patient access to address a pressing clinical need for accessible, expert testing in the growing field of transplantation,"" said Karthik Kuppusamy, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Solutions, Quest Diagnostics. ""In collaboration with Quest, transplant centers, hospital health systems and other providers can ensure living donors, recipients and care teams can access the advanced and personalized transplant diagnostics they need, even if the center performing the transplant surgery is many miles away. With greater access, more people can come together to potentially save lives.""A record-breaking 41,000+ transplants were performed nationwide in 2021, more than doubling the rate from 25 years ago.2For more information, please visit Quest Advanced® Specialized Transplant Services.About Quest DiagnosticsQuest Diagnostics empowers people to take action to improve health outcomes.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.99 a share 21 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 27, 2023.DGX has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.54%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97.DGX is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Novo Nordisk (NVO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on May 5, 2023, Novo Nordisk holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.23 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Novo Nordisk is $1.12, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 10.31%.Story continuesDGX and NVO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share, indicating a change of +11.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.76 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.54 billion and $58.64 billion estimates indicate +9.7% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.9%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.18%. The EPS surprise was +2.33%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
