You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Wolfe Research upgraded CVS Health (CVS) to Outperform from Peer Perform with an $80 price target. The firm cites confidence in Stars improvement coupled with potential for CVS to take steps to set more reasonable expectations for long term earnings growth at its December investor day for the upgrade. BofA upgraded Cintas (CTAS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $580, up from $523. The company is leader in uniform rental and other facility services, says the firm, whose confidence is building about a potential ""soft landing"" for the U.S. economy.Citi upgraded BRP Inc.

After conducting a deep dive on power sports inventories, Citi thinks BRP is well positioned to go after its fiscal 2025 targets, ""despite broad investor skepticism/disbelief.""BMO Capital upgraded AngloGold Ashanti (AU) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $22, up from $19. The stock's 41% decline since the May peak presents a more attractive entry point, the firm says.RBC Capital upgraded IAMGold (IAG) to Sector Perform from Underperform with a price target of $2.75, up from $1.75, after a different analyst at the firm assumed coverage of the name. RBC cites increased gold price forecasts for the upgrade. Top 5 Downgrades:Monness Crespi downgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Neutral from Buy.

More bearish on the name, BofA cut Sight Sciences to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $4.50, down from $10, as the uncertainty from proposed Medicare coverage changes for surgical glaucoma products has hurt ordering activity.Stephens downgraded Hostess Brands (TWNK) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $34.25, up from $32, after J.M. Smucker (SJM) announced an agreement to purchase Hostess Brands for $34.25 per share in a cash and stock deal. Top 5 Initiations: Berenberg initiated coverage of Block (SQ) with a Buy rating and $75 price target.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Edwards Lifesciences'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edwards Lifesciences is:22% = US$1.4b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.22 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Edwards Lifesciences' Earnings Growth And 22% ROEAt first glance, Edwards Lifesciences seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.2% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Edwards Lifesciences' moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Edwards Lifesciences' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 9.3% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is EW worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether EW is currently mispriced by the market.Is Edwards Lifesciences Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Edwards Lifesciences doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Edwards Lifesciences' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

CAT, KB Home KBH, Walmart Inc. WMT, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories RDY and FedEx Corp. FDX.5 Dividend Growth Stocks for Steady Returns in Uncertain TimesWall Street has been shaky in recent weeks due to a weakening Chinese economy and fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period. Against such a backdrop, investors are increasingly exploring strategies that will help them to protect their portfolios from downside risk. And nothing seems better than the strategy of dividend investing.Picking stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Caterpillar Inc., KB Home, Walmart Inc., Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and FedEx Corp. — that could be solid choices amid market volatility.Peeping Into the StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 16 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Caterpillar is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer.

""Even better, if they have more money, we'll drive more sales, so we have a bit of a hedge against that. And we're just focused on executing our plan and don't worry too much about what happens broadly with the consumer.""Investors don't seem too concerned either: Walmart stock closed at an all-time high of $164.51 per share on Tuesday.The stock has slowly been gaining momentum this month. Shares of America's largest retailer are up about 16% year to date. That's higher than the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (^DJI) year-to-date gain of almost 5% and significantly outpaces Target stock (TGT), which is down more than 17%.In the retail giant's second quarter results, Walmart posted same-store sales that rose 6.3%, more than the 4.04% expected, according to data from Bloomberg. Foot traffic also increased by 2.8% for Walmart along with a higher average ticket and online sales in the quarter.Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane, who moderated the panel with CEO Doug McMillion, told Yahoo Finance she believes Walmart will continue to gain share in grocery and general merchandise.""Walmart is speaking to a broader swath of the consumer,"" McShane said. ""It's not just the lower-end consumer anymore, so with all their digital effort, they're much more like Amazon.""Walmart sees disinflation but higher prices still 'with us'Notably, McMillon said Walmart is starting to see some signs of disinflation. But don't expect prices to drop significantly anytime soon.Story continues""Inflation and higher prices are kind of with us,"" McMillon said. ""We'll see disinflation but not all the way back to deflation. ... Certainly not in the short term.""When asked about disinflation on the grocery side, in particular, he said, ""I think it'll be slow.""Walmart store in Williston, United States on June 19, 2023. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)""We'd like for us to see the opportunity for customers to have more disinflation and have lower prices faster,"" McMillon added. ""What we've seen over the last few years has resulted in dry grocery consumables having a pretty big two-year stack inflation number, and that's coming down a little bit but not a lot.""The latest inflation data is expected Wednesday morning. In July, grocery prices increased by 0.3% on a monthly basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI). On a year-over-year basis, prices for food at home rose 3.6%, a slower rate than the month prior.As far as general merchandise categories like apparel and home decor go, declines in inflation ""look faster,"" McMillon said, but higher prices compared to two years ago are here to stay.""In general merchandise, prices are lower than they were a year ago but not as low as they were two years ago,"" McMillon said. ""I don't think that general merchandise gets all the way back down to two-year-ago prices.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

AJG recently acquired Southern Insurance Group, LLC. The buyout will help AJG consolidate its presence in Mississippi and Southeast United States.Columbia, MS-based Southern Insurance Group provides commercial and personal property/casualty insurance coverages. The addition of Southern Insurance Group will thus boost the acquirer’s capabilities in the aforesaid operating region.Arthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with buyouts made in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 25 entities in the first half of 2023 that contributed about $418 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $300 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenues.A solid capital position supports AJG in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. AJG continues to expect M&amp;A capacity upward of $3 billion through the end of 2023 and another $3 billion in 2024 without using any equity.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker’s long-term growth strategies should help it deliver organic revenue improvement and pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. AJG is focused on productivity improvements and quality enhancements that should help it post sturdy numbers in the future.  Shares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 21.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 13.3% increase. The efforts to ramp up its growth profile and capital position should continue to drive the share price higher.Given the insurance industry’s adequate capital level, players like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. Recently, Marsh, its business unit, inked a deal to purchase the entire outstanding share capital of the Australia-based specialist insurance broker Honan Insurance Group Pty Ltd. Management of Marsh believes that the inclusion of Honan’s well-established capabilities, specifically in the field of corporate risk and strata insurance, will enhance its specialist competence. This, in turn, will enable Marsh to better serve its client base across Australia and New Zealand.Acquisitions form one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Buyouts, similar to the latest one, add strength to its capabilities, expand its services offerings and enable the company to enter new geographies as well as solidify its foothold across existing markets. An upgraded services suite is likely to lure more customers and contribute more to the revenues of MMC in the days ahead.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks from the same space are Erie Indemnity Company ERIE and Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

Restaurants were only taking cash, as was the poolside bar: She had to pay cash for a margarita the previous day. An even bigger annoyance greeted guests eager to try their hand at the slot machines. Many one-armed bandits, she said, weren’t working.“People came to play, they couldn’t play and they left,” said Lopez, a hotel guest from Santa Cruz, California.Days after the cyberattack on Las Vegas-based MGM, the fallout at its properties along the city’s famous strip varied from casino to casino. Sportsbooks were closed at the Cosmopolitan and MGM Grand. Several guests faced long waits to check in because staff was doing everything by hand, jotting down credit-card information on clipboards. Slot-machine attendants cashed out players the same way.Many of the websites to MGM’s resorts, including the ones used to make reservations, remained down on Wednesday morning. The company was referring customers to third-party websites to make bookings.“Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working diligently to resolve the matter,” MGM said in a statement Tuesday. “The company will continue to implement measures to secure its business operations and take additional steps as appropriate.”Shares of MGM were down less than 1% on Wednesday morning in New York, after dropping 4% over the previous two days.Story continuesMoody’s Investors Service published a report Wednesday describing the cyberattack as credit negative for MGM Resorts, saying it “highlights key risks related to business operations’ heavy reliance on technology and the operational disruption caused when systems need go offline or are inoperable.” Additional risks include potential revenue losses while systems were down, reputational risk and any direct costs related to investigation and remediation, according to Moody’s.The report also notes that BitSight, a cybersecurity ratings and analytics company, most recently scored MGM an F for its patching cadence, the speed an organization remediates exposure to known vulnerabilities. MGM didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on BitSight’s grade.In Las Vegas on Tuesday, more than half of the guests interviewed at the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio, which seemed largely unaffected, weren’t aware of the hack. By midday Tuesday, credit cards were being accepted in at least some of MGM’s resorts.Details of the attack remain scant, including who was behind it, their possible motive and the type of information the hackers may have obtained. The FBI office in Las Vegas was aware of the attack and assisting, an agency spokesperson said. MGM was also the victim of a 2019 data breach that exposed personal information on as many as 10.6 million customers.MGM shut certain systems after discovering the attack over the weekend and began an investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts, according to a statement posted on social media. By Monday evening, MGM was saying its resorts, including dining, entertainment and gaming, were “currently operational.”Clearly not without some snags.A waiter at the Cosmopolitan, who asked not to be identified, said credit-card payments were working, but online orders and communications between properties remained down.Traffic at the MGM Grand was noticeably light. A number of slot machines weren’t functioning, and an ATM machine wasn’t providing cash advances.(Updates with statement from company in seventh paragraph and insights from Moody’s starting in ninth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Sam Bankman-Fried’s Elite Parents Enabled His Crypto EmpireAn Online Startup Pitches a New Kind of MBATikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce ThreatThe Massive Guatemalan Operation That Wants to Sell Americans Their Old Clothes BackThe Best Times to Buy Your Concert Tickets©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Oil prices hit new year-to-date highs on Tuesday with West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) closing just below $89 per barrel. Brent crude futures (BZ=F) sat above $92 per barrel — the highest levels in oil prices since November 2022.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in August climbed 4.3% over last year — a slowdown from the 4.7% annual increase seen in July, according to Bloomberg data. Monthly core prices rose 0.3%, slightly higher than economist expectations of a 0.2% month-over-month gain and also higher than July's 0.2% monthly rise.The energy index decreased 3.6% for the 12 months ending in August on an unadjusted basis, although prices increased 5.6% on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis after rising just 0.1% in July.Gas prices rose 10.6% in August following a 0.2% increase in the previous month.Within core inflation, rent prices continued to surge. The index for rent and owners' equivalent rose 0.5% and 0.4% on a monthly basis, respectively. Owners' equivalent rent is the hypothetical rent a homeowner would pay.The shelter index was the largest factor in the monthly increase of core inflation, increasing 0.3% month-over-month and 7.3% over the last year. Still, both of those measures were down compared to July's 7.7% annual gain and 0.4% monthly jump.Other indexes that rose in August included motor vehicle insurance, medical care, and personal care, BLS noted.Story continuesThe indexes for lodging away from home, recreation, and used cars and trucks were among those that decreased over the month. The monthly prices for used cars and trucks dropped another 1.2% in August after seeing prices fall 1.3% in July.The food index increased 4.3% in August over the last year, with food prices rising 0.2% from July to August. The index for food at home increased 0.2% over the month, after rising 0.3% in July.The index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rose 0.8% in August as the index for pork increased 2.2%.

That, along with the upward pressure in oil and a labor market that, while softening, is still tight, adds to concerns that the Federal Reserve could continue to raise interest rates later this year.Read more: What the latest Fed rate hike plan means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsBut markets still expect the central bank to pause its hikes at its meeting later this month. Following the release of the data, markets were pricing in a roughly 95% chance the Federal Reserve keeps rates unchanged at its Sept. 20 policy meeting, according to data from the CME Group.The central bank raised rates by another 0.25% in July after pausing its aggressive rate-hiking cycle in June.""In our view, the economy maintains decent momentum but is showing signs of slowing, and thus the Federal Reserve is likely to pause next week and wait for additional data to unfold for the November meeting,"" Brian Pietrangelo, senior vice president and managing director of investment strategy at Key Private Bank, wrote in a reaction to the report.Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed but warned one more rate hike is still possible before the end of the year: ""The inflation print likely is not enough to tilt next week’s Fed call towards a hike, yet it also hasn’t entirely cleared up the question of a November pause vs. hike.""""The rise in headline should come as no surprise given the recent run-up in energy prices and the Fed will likely look through the number… for now,"" the economist continued. ""But the general expectation was that core inflation would remain stable, if not decelerate this month, so the upside surprise probably leaves the Fed with a bad taste in its mouth and keeps it wondering if it still has more work to do.""Multiple economists said the slowdown in shelter prices is a good sign for the central bank, but that the higher increases seen in the prices of services and core inflation will likely ""keep the Fed in a defensive stance,"" noted Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Raymond James.""The decline in core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) on a year-over-year basis is also a good omen for the Fed,"" Aleman said. ""However, the decision for next week’s FOMC meeting will not be one to take lightly, especially because core CPI was higher than expected and because oil prices have continued to increase in September.""Read more coverage on where inflation stands:Stocks edge up after inflation data comes in hot: Stock market news todayThe Fed will look past inflation uptick, economists sayInflation: New and used car prices are moderatingInflation: Grocery prices ticked up slightly in August, but egg prices continued fallingAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This surge is attributed to escalating oil prices, with WTI Crude Oil nearing a 2023 peak of $89 per barrel.However, core CPI, is expected to slow to 4.3% in August from July's 4.7%.The CoinDesk Currency Select Index (CCYS) has also seen a modest rise of 1%, positioning itself at 1,195.80 while ether, another stands firm at $1,593, despite a 2.2% dip in the past week.Bernd Sischka, Chief Commercial Officer at PowerTrade, a crypto options and derivatives exchange, said to CoinDesk in a note that this swift rally wasn't necessarily driven by a genuine shift from bearish to bullish sentiments. Instead, it appeared to be spurred by aggressive short covering and a liquidity crunch, leading to rapid and volatile price movements.""For a sustained bullish momentum in Bitcoin's price, we'd need to see a consistent close above the critical resistance levels of $26,440 and $26,450,” Sischka said. “Although the market did breach this threshold intraday, it could not sustain above it by the close. This suggests impending near-term market weakness.""Sischka argued that the U.S. CPI number release generally is a catalyst for more market volatility as overall orderbook liquidity remains low.Perhaps unrelated to inflation concerns, the price of Curve's CRV token is falling, currently trading at $0.39, down 3.3%, due to an influx of coins on exchanges, top holders reducing their holdings, and recent negative events in the protocol, including a DeFi exploit and the founder's significant token sale.Inflation Less of a Concern for CompaniesA recent note from FactSet shows that the number of S&amp;P 500 companies mentioning ""inflation"" during their Q2 earnings calls has seen a decline.Story continuesFactSet’s research shows that 296 companies cited the term during their earnings calls, marking the lowest since Q2, 2021 and the fourth consecutive quarter of decline. Notably, this figure still surpasses the 5-year average of 217 and the 10-year average of 168.FactSet analysts found that companies that mentioned ""inflation"" during their Q2 earnings calls witnessed a weaker stock price performance in recent months compared to those that didn't.Is CPI Still a Driver of Crypto Prices?In a keynote at Korea Blockchain Week, Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX and current Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom argued that the relationship between CPI, inflation, and crypto prices isn’t what it once was.Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes, bitcoin and other risk assets have shown unexpected resilience. Hayes believes that these rate hikes, meant to counter inflation, have paradoxically spurred economic growth by stimulating spending and nominal GDP growth.“It's different than what's happened before. The standard playbook is starting to break down,” Hayes said. ""Whether the Fed raises or cuts, we're in a good position as a cryptocurrency industry.""]"

The upgrades support Fort Martin and Harrison’s continued operation until 2035 and 2040, when they are scheduled to retire. Together, the two plants produce 3,080 megawatts of power.Benefits of the MoveIn addition to helping Mon Power and Potomac Edison in continuing to support clean drinking water, agriculture and recreation in nearby communities, the environmental upgrades at Fort Martin Power Station in Maidsville, Monongalia County, and Harrison Power Station in Haywood, Harrison County, will help FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries in meeting the updated effluent limitation guideline requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.After the completion of the project, ashes from the furnaces will be turned into tiny bits and dropped onto conveyor belts for disposal. With the new method, there will be less wastewater that needs to be carefully treated before being disposed in the river, thereby protecting aquatic habitats.Conveyor belts will be built as part of the renovations to move coal ash to a brand-new, three-sided concrete building on each plant's property. The dry ash will then be loaded into trucks and sent to a nearby authorized disposal site owned and operated by the companies. It is expected that the projects will be completed by the end of 2025.FE’s Focus on Emission ReductionThe environmental impact of the project is in sync with FirstEnergy’s commitment to protecting and restoring the environment and creating a more sustainable future for its customers and communities. The company set a goal of reducing carbon emissions by at least 90% below 2005 level by 2045, and to become 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, with a mid-term goal of 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within its direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level.FirstEnergy aims to achieve its emission target by replacing aging transmission, electrifying its vehicle fleet, moving away from coal generation and focusing on generation efficiencies.Along with FirstEnergy, other electric power companies like Alliant Energy Corp. LNT, Dominion Energy, Inc. D and Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL also aim to lower emissions and become carbon neutral in the future.  Alliant Energy benefits from retiring coal-fired units, and adding clean assets to its portfolio to achieve its target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.LNT’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.47%.

However, it is lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, suggesting that the stock might be undervalued.Insider Sell: Salesforce Inc's President and Chief Engineering Officer Srinivas Tallapragada Sells 10,000 SharesAccording to the GuruFocus Value, which is an intrinsic value estimate based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates, Salesforce Inc's stock is modestly undervalued. The stock's price-to-GF-Value ratio is 0.86, with a GF Value of $262.93, indicating that the stock's price is lower than its estimated value.In conclusion, the recent sell-off by Srinivas Tallapragada, coupled with the overall trend of insider sells at Salesforce Inc, could be a signal of the stock's overvaluation. However, the GuruFocus Value suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. Investors should keep a close eye on these trends and make informed decisions based on comprehensive analysis.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

That means customers can add their own custom prompts for their products or brand or to include items specific to their business or market that aren’t available out of the box with Einstein GPT or Einstein Copilot.The skills builder enables companies to add actions to prompts. “There's also Skills Builder, which means that Einstein Copilot is now no longer just accessing your data and answering questions on the data. Companies also have the ability to control and designate which workflows they want Copilot to have access to and run,"" she said. Some examples include running a competitor analysis or objection handling, according to Shih.The final piece lets you bring your own model, or use one of the supported third-party offerings like Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, Google Cloud's Vertex AI and OpenAI. “These are for more of the enterprise companies that have large data science teams. They want to bring their own models,” she said. Shih says this is an update to the bring your own model idea introduced earlier this year.Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says Studio fills a gap for companies who need more than the base tooling. “The power of Studio is it's the place where all the components are accessible from across the Salesforce platforms, which is a major part of simplifying prompt and skills creation for admins that address real-word use cases specific to organizational needs,” Leary said.Story continuesSalesforce is well aware of the problem with hallucinations when a model makes up an answer, and other issues like bias and inappropriate responses that can impact large language models. Shih says they are building a system they call ""the Einstein Trust Layer"" to help companies manage things like security, governance and data privacy.In addition, by using the data in Data Cloud, introduced last year at Dreamforce as Genie, it can help ensure to a degree that it’s going to give accurate answers, based on information that's in Salesforce's databases.Shih says customers can also tune prompts and skills in Studio, depending on the nature of the question, and on how much risk is at play, whether to fully automate a response or indicate that a human must be involved. “So if it's a simple question and answer like ‘how much do we charge for a wire transfer?’ -- first of all, I haven't seen it hallucinate on that -- but the stakes are lower than enabling Copilot to do something like helping transfer a large amount of money without talking to a person.” In a case like that, she said you would probably want to set up a rule to get a person involved before the transaction can take place.It’s worth noting that it is widely believed that there is currently no known way to completely eliminate hallucinations in large language models.While Shih admits that AI could eliminate some jobs, she sees new jobs being added too. ""I think it's a big moment in time, and there will certainly be impact to certain jobs. And there will also certainly be new jobs that are being created, such as the prompt engineer,"" she said. The Studio product could be part of that.Einstein Copilot Studio will be available in pilot sometime this fall. The Einstein Trust Layer will be generally available across the Einstein platform next month, according to the company.

Although the purchase only increased their holding by 1.5%, it is still a solid purchase in our view. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Sealed AirNotably, that recent purchase by Edward Doheny is the biggest insider purchase of Sealed Air shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$33.93. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Sealed Air share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.In the last twelve months Sealed Air insiders were buying shares, but not selling.

That equates to 0.8% of the company.

And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Sealed Air we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future.

Buoyed by such strengths, shares of this footwear dealer have gained 15.6% against the industry’s 6.6% decline over the past year.Delving DeeperWith respect to the e-commerce efforts, management has added high-level talent to the organization, ramped up digital marketing spending, improved data science capabilities, launched a try-before-you-buy payment facility, rolled out buy online, pick-up in store across its entire U.S. full-price retail outlets, and introduced advanced delivery and return options. The company has also been significantly accelerating its digital commerce initiatives concerning distribution.Steven Madden is focused on driving growth across the direct-to-consumer business, led by digital capabilities; expanding categories apart from footwear, such as handbags and apparel; enhancing its presence in the international markets and reinforcing its core U.S. wholesale footwear business. Gains from increased investment in digital marketing and robust consumer reception capabilities such as try before you buy have been strengths.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrudent acquisitions have been aiding Steven Madden’s performance.

Additionally, management had concluded the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% share of its European joint venture. This transaction distributes the company’s branded footwear and accessories across the majority of countries in Europe.However, the company has posted soft second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Revenues and earnings also declined year over year. In the reported quarter, the company witnessed a challenging operating environment, conservative order patterns from wholesale customers and tough year-over-year comparisons.Nevertheless, Steven Madden has reduced its inventory levels and saw a solid gross margin performance despite the promotional retail backdrop. During the second quarter, gross margin expanded 190 basis points (bps) to 42.6%. As a percentage of wholesale revenues, gross profit increased 200 bps to 33.6%, driven by higher margins in the Wholesale accessories/apparel business.  The company has also been managing expenses.A proven business model, robust brands and various growth opportunities position the company well to drive overall growth and boost stakeholders’ value in the long run. On its earnings call, management said the company is poised to witness significant improvement in its financial performance starting in the third quarter.Considering its strengths, Steven Madden seems to be a decent investment bet.

The momentum persisted in the first half of 2023.

55,6e00d5c3-5773-3588-ac40-8bbfe5817095,NWS,2023-09-13,Need to Move? We're Approaching the Best Time to Buy in 2023,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/move-were-approaching-best-time-100000518.html,1694599200.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Although mortgage rates remain high, the week of Oct. 1, 2023 is expected to offer buyers the best overlap of reduced home prices and competition alongside increased inventory, according to Realtor.com®.SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As mortgage rates hit their highest peak in more than two decades, Americans determined to make a home purchase this year are navigating a dauntingly difficult housing market. With approximately 4.2 million home sales expected in 2023, Realtor.com® analyzed the numbers in its fifth annual Best Time to Buy Report, identifying key factors to consider when buying a home, apart from mortgage rates. According to the new report: inventory, prices, and competition from other buyers are in peak alignment across the nation during the week of Oct. 1, offering homebuyers a window of opportunity to make the most of their purchase this year.This early-fall period will offer buyers the most favorable moment to buy during the remainder of the year, with more home listings, less competition, and lower prices. This week may offer:Up to 17% more active listings than at the start of the year.Savings of more than $15,000 relative to the summer's peak price of $445,000More time to decide as homes are expected to stay on the market for one week longer than during this year's peakLess competition with demand expected to be 18.7% lower than peak buying periods""Mortgage rates have been more than 6% since September 2022 and could continue this trend for another year. Even as prices fell this summer, the monthly payment to finance a median-priced home was still more than 20% higher than last year,""1 said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com®. ""Mortgage rates continue to be a big wild card for Americans hoping to buy a home. Our analysis shows that buying in the fall does give buyers some more predictable advantages that could potentially ease the pain of higher rates and other stressful aspects of the home buying process, including making fast decisions and bidding wars.""Story continuesHale added, ""For buyers trying to close this fall, saving a search on Realtor.com® can help them stay up to date on homes in their price range without the work of having to refresh or recreate their search.""Since 2018, Realtor.com® has analyzed home prices, inventory, listing views, and time on market, indicators that tend to follow regular seasonal patterns, to determine the best time to buy. Here's how these factors breakdown during this unique window:Reduced Prices: Historically, an average of 5.5% of homes have price reductions during the Best Time to Buy period, which means roughly 40,000 homes across the U.S. could see price reductions, based on inventory estimates. During this week, prices typically dip 3.3%, compared to the typical season high, translating to $15,000 in savings. And in several of the largest housing markets around the country, home prices during the best week to buy can dip more than 10% below their peak price earlier in the year, potentially saving buyers tens of thousands of dollars.Increased Listings To Choose From: This year, inventory will likely be lower than in years past as hesitant sellers shy away from the market. However, seasonal inventory trends are still expected and project 11.7% more active listings for the week of Oct.1 than the average week of the year, and 17.2% more than the start of the year.Less Competition From Other Buyers: Home buyers shopping during the best week to buy can expect less competition from other buyers. This year, we saw a return to some pre-pandemic home shopping trends – with the most views per listing in the spring, and prospective buyers continuing to explore the housing market during the summer months – meaning fewer buyers to compete with this fall. While there may still be more competition than pre-pandemic, buyers can expect demand to be 18.7% lower than peak buying periods in 2023, and 13.5% lower than the average week.A More Manageable Timeline: While homes are still spending less time on the market than pre-pandemic, the breakneck pace of the housing market has slowed. During the best time to buy, buyers can spend more time considering their options rather than making quick decisions, and sellers may become more flexible as their listings linger. Historically slowing by 29% compared to the year's peak pace – homes were on the market for an average of 43 days in June 2023 – buyers can expect more than one week extra to deliberate in early October.More Fresh Listings: Despite the count of new listings having fallen this year as homeowners hesitate to sell amidst financial concerns tied to record-high mortgage rates, new listing declines have leveled off. Historically, the best week to buy has seen the addition of 18.9% more homes than at the start of the year, and early October is set to offer the highest influx of fresh listings compared to the remainder of the year.Methodology:Realtor.com analyzed six supply and demand metrics at a national and metropolitan level that follow seasonal patterns, using data for 2018-2022 period (2020 data was omitted due to anomalies caused by the pandemic). Those metrics analyzed include: 1) listing prices, 2) inventory levels, 3) new ""fresh"" listings, 4) time on market, 5) homebuyer demand (realtor.com views per property) and 6) price reductions. Interest rates, which do not follow seasonal patterns, were not included. To account for 2022 market conditions, estimates reflect typical seasonal patterns layered on top of the most recent 2022 weekly data.Each week of the year was scored from 0 to 100 based on the number of active listings. A given week scored highly if it had more listings compared to other weeks of the year. The other metrics were scored in the same way, such that each week had six different scores for active listings, new listings, listing prices, days on market, price reductions, and views per property. (In the case of prices, lower prices score higher. Same with views per property).Each week was then ranked by the average of those scores. The week with the highest composite score was considered the best time to buy. This week represents a balanced view of market conditions favorable for buyers.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The billionaire, who also owns the social media platform X, added that a regulator would ""ensure that companies take actions that are safe and in the interest of the general public.""Musk said the meeting was a ""service to humanity"" and said it ""may go down in history as very important to the future of civilization."" Musk confirmed he had called AI ""a double-edged sword"" during the forum.Zuckerberg said Congress ""should engage with AI to support innovation and safeguards. This is an emerging technology, there are important equities to balance here, and the government is ultimately responsible for that."" He added it was ""better that the standard is set by American companies that can work with our government to shape these models on important issues.""More than 60 senators took part. Lawmakers said there was universal agreement about the need for government regulation of AI.""We are beginning to really deal with one of the most significant issues facing the next generation and we got a great start on it today,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who organized the forum, told reporters after the meetings. ""We have a long way to go.""Republican Senator Todd Young, a co-host of the forum, said he believes the Senate is ""getting to the point where I think committees of jurisdiction will be ready to begin their process of considering legislation.""Story continuesBut Republican Senator Mike Rounds cautioned it would take time for Congress to act. ""Are we ready to go out and write legislation? Absolutely not,"" Rounds said. ""We're not there.""Lawmakers want safeguards against potentially dangerous deep fakes such as bogus videos, election interference and attacks on critical infrastructure.Other attendees included Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and AFL-CIO labor federation President Liz Shuler.Schumer emphasized the need for regulation ahead of the 2024 U.S. general election, particularly around deep fakes.""A lot of things that have to be done, but that one has a quicker timetable maybe than some of the others,"" he said.In March, Musk and a group of AI experts and executives called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4, citing potential risks to society.Regulators globally have been scrambling to draw up rules governing the use of generative AI, which can create text and generate images whose artificial origins are virtually undetectable.On Tuesday, Adobe, IBM, Nvidia and five other companies said they had signed President Joe Biden's voluntary AI commitments requiring steps such as watermarking AI-generated content.The commitments, announced in July, are aimed at ensuring AI's power is not used for destructive purposes. Google, OpenAI and Microsoft signed on in July.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Archer-Daniels-Midland’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Worth?According to my valuation model, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to be fairly priced at around 14.97% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Archer-Daniels-Midland today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $69.33, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Archer-Daniels-Midland’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Archer-Daniels-Midland look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, ADM appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on ADM should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you'd like to know more about Archer-Daniels-Midland as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

""Satin is the perfect representation of these sentiments with its cheerful yellow base grounded in a calming beige undertone.""Satin is a warm, honey-beige tone that is strong enough to stand alone as the leading colour in almost any design palette, yet soft enough to work as a supporting hue to both warm and cool-toned shades.

(NASDAQ:MAT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Mattel The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$564.3mUS$734.0mUS$687.0mUS$735.0mUS$771.7mUS$803.7mUS$832.2mUS$858.2mUS$882.5mUS$905.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.00%Est @ 4.14%Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.83%Est @ 2.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$519US$620US$534US$525US$507US$485US$462US$438US$414US$391(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.9bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$906m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.2%) = US$14bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$14b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$6.0bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$11b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$21.3, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mattel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.324. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MattelStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

(ZION) experienced its most promising day since July, with a notable increase in net interest income. In contrast, Northern Trust (NTRS) reported an unexpected decline in net interest income. Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and Julie Hyman provide an analysis of the regional banking sector and how it could have an effect on commercial real estate and future interest rates.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Some of the movers or the top movers of the day. And we're watching regional banks following updates from the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. Zions Bancorp seeing its best day since July, as the company reported higher net interest income in July and August.But it wasn't all good news. Northern Trust underselling pressure as it warned of a bigger than expected decline in net interest income. Julie, the backdrop to all of this is we're talking about these particular banks today, but it really is about a cloud that's been hanging over regional banks overall.You look at where the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF has performed, it's down 25% year to date. And there's still a lot of questions, especially around commercial real estate. There was that big headline coming out of The Journal a few days ago about the doom loop that could potentially happen, the exposure that some of these regional banks have in that area, whether that could create a domino effect. Of course, all of this stemming from the concerns that happened earlier this year with SVB and the collapse there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, the conversation seems to have shifted to some extent from deposits, which was really centered on what happened with SVB and the others and was there a big hit to deposits in the wake of that, and more focused on what is on the balance sheet, which also goes back to SVB, right? Are there big unrealized losses for some of these banks related to commercial real estate, related to other holdings that they have, related even to things like treasuries, which was something that was a vulnerability for that bank as well? And then sort of related to that, as we see interest rates rise, a lot of the commentary coming out of Barclays today in that conference had to do with net interest income, which, of course, is very closely linked to what is happening with interest rates.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So I mean, looking at where those two names perform today, I mean, this is just kind of one headline coming out of that. But regional banks are certainly going to be in focus moving forward as well. And of course, there's the regulation talk around that, too.JULIE HYMAN: Right, definitely.]"

That's double its prior forecast, made in July, of a 5% drop.Like many financial institutions in the current high interest rate environment, Northern Trust is confronting growing financing costs as tries to hold onto deposits.""So costs are up, and we - coming at the end of second quarter - felt good about cost pressure. We knew it was coming, but it hadn't really hit hard. In the third quarter, it's hit very hard,"" Tyler said.Northern Trust shares sank to $69.81, down more than 9%, to their lowest level since mid-July after Tyler's comments. The stock, which has now lost nearly 19% year-to-date, was last at $71.99.A Northern Trust spokesperson did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further comment.Asset and wealth managers, including Northern Trust and peer State Street Corp, are seeing a decline in NII as customers move deposits to higher yielding alternatives.In July, Northern Trust reported that its deposits fell by 10% to $91.9 billion in the second quarter, although Tyler said on Tuesday deposits have generally stabilized.Separately, Northern Trust on Tuesday published its flagship annual Capital Market Assumptions report, which forecast constrained global economic growth that could result in higher bond yields over the next decade, but a slow down in returns from equities.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Michelle Price and Mark Potter)]"

Forecasts are created with a ""forward-looking, historically aware"" approach, analyzing the past drivers of returns across asset classes and developing investment themes that inform how those return drivers may evolve in the future.For fixed income, Northern Trust expects higher yields to improve returns while defaults remain near the long-term average. The report forecasts global high yield bonds to return 7.2% annualized over the next 10 years, compared to 3.5% during the last 10 years. The global investment grade bond return forecast is 3.7% annualized, up from 2.1% in the past decade.For equities, elevated inflation will likely support solid sales growth but may also cause falling profit margins from higher input and financing costs, muddying the outlook. Northern Trust expects global equities to return 6.3% annualized over the next decade, down from 10.4% in the previous decade. In developed markets, the report forecasts the highest annualized returns from Australia (7.2%) and Canada (6.9%) and the lowest returns from Japan and Europe, both at 6%. The forecast for emerging markets is 5.9% annualized, down from 6.1% in the past 10 years as China’s economy struggles.""While we expect the strong market momentum to continue in the short-term, we see headwinds on the horizon,"" said Northern Trust Asset Management Global Chief Investment Officer Angelo Manioudakis. ""Over the next 10 years, we think certain factors – including increased geopolitical risk, elevated debt levels with higher financing costs and demographic shifts in most of the developed world – will constrain long-term growth.""Story continuesThe report features Northern Trust’s expectations for long-term asset class returns and informs the recommended strategic asset allocations for all Northern Trust managed portfolios and multi-asset class products.The CMA Report’s asset class forecasts are driven by six key themes that Northern Trust investment experts see affecting markets and the economy over the next 10 years:Growth Restraints: Costly investments for regionalization and climate change may handcuff economic growth — and investment returns — already restrained by high government debt and aging populations. Artificial intelligence may unshackle growth but needs large investments (and time) before it can support the global economy.""We expect to see a transition over the next 10 years from recent economic disruptions to longer-term structural restraints on growth,"" said Chris Shipley, Northern Trust Asset Management Chief Investment Strategist for North America. ""Admittedly, our global growth forecast averaging 2.4% a year seems anemic relative to the previous decade. Rapidly advancing technologies like AI could contribute to growth, but probably not be enough to overcome increasingly difficult economic challenges.""Geopolitical Fault Lines: The deepening U.S.-China strategic rivalry has elevated global political risks, enough to alter fundamentals for investors. Even historically stable political dynamics could shift abruptly and impact equity valuations.Inflation Adaptation: While we expect global economic growth to backtrack, inflation should persist. Tight labor markets, regionalization and higher commodity prices will likely more than offset technology’s disinflationary promise. Investors, consumers and policymakers must adapt.Central Bank Concessions: New, more permanent inflationary forces complicate central banks’ abilities to reach their objectives. Over time, we think central banks will ultimately concede inflation modestly higher than their targets rather than create undue economic harm.""We believe central bank rates are close to peaking and will start to decline in 2024, but the developed-market annualized rate of inflation will likely remain above their 2% targets for the next 10 years,"" said Wouter Sturkenboom, Northern Trust Asset Management’s Chief Investment Strategist for Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions. ""We anticipate an environment in which investors and central banks will have to adapt to prices settling slightly above target levels. We forecast annualized inflation at 2.2% in Europe, lower than our forecast of 2.6% for the U.S. We anticipate more downside risk to prices in Europe given more direct exposure to China, where we expect inflation to be softer at 2.2% because of a soft economic growth outlook.""A Sustainable Green Transition: Countries want to cut emissions and improve energy security, so the green energy transition is still a go. But it requires vast amounts of financing and natural resources. Investors must navigate environmental and economic priorities.Private Matters: Private markets continue to grow, backed by improving liquidity supported by strengthening market infrastructure. Private investments are primed to play an increasingly important role in the economy and investors’ portfolios.The full report, which outlines the firm’s long-term asset class return expectations and forecasts for the next 10 years, is available at CapitalMarketAssumptions.com.IMPORTANT INFORMATION:The publisher’s sale of this reprint does not constitute or imply any endorsement or sponsorship of any product, service or organization.The information contained herein is for use with current or prospective clients of Northern Trust Investments, Inc. and not for distribution.

PSX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PSXKevin Mitchell has been with Phillips 66 since its inception in 2012, serving as the company's CFO. He has played a crucial role in the company's financial strategy and operations, contributing to its growth and success in the energy sector.Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company. With a portfolio of Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties businesses, the company processes, transports, stores and markets fuels and products globally. Phillips 66 Partners, the companys master limited partnership, is integral to the portfolio. Headquartered in Houston, the company has 14,300 employees committed to safety and operating excellence.The insider's recent sell-off has raised some eyebrows among investors and analysts, prompting a closer look at the company's stock performance and insider trading trends.Insider Sell: Kevin Mitchell Sells 30,800 Shares of Phillips 66 (PSX)The insider transaction history for Phillips 66 shows a trend of more sells than buys over the past year. There have been 8 insider sells and only 1 insider buy during this period. This could indicate that insiders, including Mitchell, may perceive the stock as overvalued, prompting them to sell their shares.On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Phillips 66 were trading at $120.97, giving the company a market cap of $55.2 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 5.38, lower than both the industry median of 9.13 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that despite the insider's sell-off, the stock may still be undervalued based on earnings.Story continuesInsider Sell: Kevin Mitchell Sells 30,800 Shares of Phillips 66 (PSX)However, when looking at the price-to-GF-Value ratio, which stands at 1.09, the stock appears to be modestly overvalued. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, taking into account historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell-off may raise concerns, it's important for investors to consider the broader context. Despite the sell-off, Phillips 66's stock may still hold value based on its earnings, although it appears modestly overvalued when considering the GF Value. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The results coming out of this year’s second quarter were decidedly mixed. While some consumer companies, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), had strong showings that pushed their share prices to all-time highs, others such as Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) laid an egg, sending their stocks sharply lower.Executives spent a lot of time talking about the impact of inflation, declining spending on big ticket items, and in-store theft or shrink as it is known in the retail sector. The overall picture painted was a gloomy one, with many retailers revising down their forecasts for the remainder of the year. However, amid the negativity, a few companies specializing in consumer goods managed to standout with strong financial results and upbeat forward guidance.Here are the three best consumer stocks to buy now: September 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsON Holding AG (ONON)A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comON Holdings (NYSE:ONON) makes running shoes that are very popular with consumers right now. The Swiss-based company is using global celebrities, such as tennis star Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen, to market its sneakers and brand them as cool and trendy. Judging by the stock’s performance, ON Holdings is succeeding. Year-to-date, ONON stock is up 80%. The company’s shares have only been publicly traded since September 2021.Despite the big run in ONON stock, there’s currently an opportunity for investors to buy into the stock after it pulled back following the company’s recent financial results. The company’s share price dropped 14% on August 15 after ON Holdings’ second-quarter print raised concerns about inventory levels. The stock looks to have bottomed on August 28 and has been trending higher since then, making now an ideal time for investors to take a position.Notably, On Holdings reported that its Q2 sales rose 52% from the previous year and its profit margins grew to 59.5% from 55.1%. While inventory levels ticked up from a year earlier, the company is confident they can unwind them in coming months.

As a result, CELH stock has gained an incredible 4,450% in the last five years. This year, the share price has risen more than 100%, including a 40% climb over the last month while the broader market slumped.Celsius Holdings’ business has gotten a boost from its partnership with beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The companies forged a partnership last year, which got Celsius’ drinks onto Pepsi’s global distribution network, which has supercharged sales and helped the energy drinks enter new markets.PepsiCo made a $550 million investment into Celsius in exchanged for preferred stock that equates to an 8.5% ownership stake. The energy drink maker just reported that its Q2 revenue rose 104% from a year earlier to $325.9 million.TJX Companies (TJX)An outside shot of a T.J.

The company behind T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods continues to attract consumers who are looking for bargains amid the current high inflation environment.

TJX stock has increased 44% over the last 12 months, outpacing nearly all other retailers.TJX posted Q2 earnings per share (EPS) of 85 cents versus 77 cents that had been expected among analysts.

The company raised its full-year guidance after posting a 7.7% year-over-year sales increase and 23% growth in its profits.Company executives also made little mention of in-store theft during their Q2 earnings call.

105,fe5f331f-df59-318f-b70e-a3ef32834edf,AMGN,2023-09-13,Investors Heavily Search Amgen Inc. (AMGN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-amgen-inc-130006381.html,1694523606,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has gained 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.92 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.26 billion and $31.01 billion estimates indicate +3.6% and +13.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A 15% annual increase in new planes is projected to be witnessed in the region in 2023.Boeing’s report estimates that by 2040, air travel within Asia Pacific markets will account for nearly half of global air traffic, driving 20-year demand for 17,645 new airplanes valued at $3.1 trillion. With its established presence in the Asia Pacific, further enhanced by the 190 737 Max order from Air India this June, along with the latest commitment from Vietnam Airlines, Boeing’s profitability should increase in the coming days. Boeing also has a deal with VietJet for the delivery of 200 of its 737 MAX planes.Story continuesOpportunities for PeersA few other aerospace players that can gain from the expanding aviation market in the Asia Pacific region are Airbus SE EADSY, General Dynamics Corp.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

If you wish to skip our analysis of countries supporting climate-smart initiatives, read 8 Countries That Care About The Environment The Most.Recognizing the dangers of climate deterioration, countries that care about the environment the most have heavily invested in renewables, such as wind energy, to mitigate the effects of climate change. These investments in climate-friendly initiatives serve as economic strategies and help countries achieve their environmental conservation goals. The European Green Deal, which aims to make the European Union climate-neutral by 2050, is a prime example. In addition to investing in sustainable energy sources, countries that care about the environment the most prioritize R&amp;D for green technologies. For instance, Israel's commitment to water research has effectively addressed its water scarcity challenges, positioning it as a global leader in water technologies.Learn about the countries most affected by climate change by reading Top 20 Countries Most Affected by Global Warming.Impact Of Climate-Conscious Efforts The renewable energy industry has fostered technological innovation, reduced energy costs, and created jobs. The International Labor Organization reports that the renewable energy sector has generated 12.7 million jobs worldwide, even amidst multiple crises. Similarly, the transportation sector, a significant contributor to emissions, has seen innovations such as Japan's high-speed rail networks and the Netherlands' expansive cycling infrastructure.These advancements help mitigate environmental damage and decrease countries' dependence on dwindling non-renewable energy sources. Electric vehicles (EVs) have garnered significant support, notably in countries like New Zealand and Norway, which aim to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine cars. Due to incentive and cash rebate programs, EV sales increased by 41% in 2020, despite a 16% decrease in global car sales, according to the World Economic Forum.Story continuesGovernments provide considerable subsidies, tax exemptions, and incentives to encourage EV adoption. These include reduced road tolls, free parking, and access to bus lanes. The European Alternative Fuels Observatory states that drivers are exempt from purchase tax on EVs, and companies purchasing them can receive $1400-4600 in governmental support per vehicle, depending on its size. Consequently, Norway boasts one of the highest per capita numbers of EVs. Likewise, in New Zealand, the Clean Car Discount Scheme offers cash rebates on electric and hybrid vehicle purchases, aiming to make such vehicles more affordable for residents.Countries that produce the most greenhouse gases significantly contribute to climate deterioration. You can check them out in the preceding link.Energy Companies Benefiting From Climate-Smart SubsidiesSolar power and EVs were once considered unconventional, with only a few entities actively pursuing them. However, over the past decade, there has been a surge in interest in these eco-friendly power and transportation sources, especially in countries with strong environmental policies. According to the Climate Tech Report 2020, $87.5 billion was invested in climate tech from 2020 to 2021. As the public's interest in 'going green' grows, governments are supporting the biggest greentech companies in the world.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), the largest producer of wind and solar energy, boasts a diverse portfolio that includes wind, solar, and nuclear energy. The company plans to add 3,184 megawatts of solar power to the nation's capacity. In 2020, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)'s electricity generation capacity stood at 55,000 megawatts, with over 90% of its electricity coming from clean or renewable sources. Its FPL SolarTogether project aims to establish the most extensive community solar program in the US. This project of Florida Power &amp; Light, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), represents a considerable expansion of solar capacity in the state, intending to add 1,780 MW of new universal solar capacity, potentially serving more than 300,000 customers.Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) is another forward-thinking company dedicated to environmentally-friendly energy practices. Currently, Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) provides clean energy to nearly 7 million people and has an installed capacity of 27,100 megawatts. Of the total electricity supplied by Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D), 3,100 megawatts are derived from clean energy sources such as solar and hydropower, a stamp to its advanced solar initiatives. As the biggest power generation companies in the world and other stakeholders embrace eco-friendly practices, it will become easier for nations leading in environmental protection to counteract potential ecological degradation.You can also explore the Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In to capitalize on the green energy industry. 15 Countries That Care About The Environment Most15 Countries That Care About The Environment MostOur Methodology We ranked the top environmentally conscious countries based on their environmental commitment and efforts towards renewable energy using three indices: the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the Energy Transition Index (ETI), and the Renewable Energy category of the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI).We found that countries ranking high in these indices are doing well towards achieving their climate conservation goals. Therefore, after identifying 15 top-performing countries across these indices, we used a weighted average method to derive our list of the top environmentally conscious countries. We listed our chosen countries as per their rankings in these three resources and then employed the averaging method to find our final rankings.We applied the following weights to compute the weighted average scores: 0.4 for the ETI, 0.3 for the EPI, and 0.3 for the Renewable Energy category of the CCPI.Based on this methodology, the following are the countries that care about the environment the most:15.

The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are. • Index &lt; 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.August is the 14th successive month in which global demand displayed weakness, reflecting the brittle global economic environment. Conditions are their most fragile in Europe, where demand continues to fall drastically, and recession risks appear their most prominent. Demand also fell considerably across North America in August, indicating a slowing economy. In contrast, demand conditions are more stable in Asia, despite the slow Chinese economy, with purchasing rising strongly in India, Indonesia and Vietnam.Notably, global transportation costs rose to their highest level since February amid renewed pressures on fuel prices as oil producers announced cuts to supply. U.S. and European manufacturers are also experiencing some renewed pressures arising from staff shortages due to tight labor markets and wage pressures.Commenting on the August data, Neha Shah, president, GEP, said: ""Our data shows that we're currently on a fine line hovering between recession and stagnation. Despite many months of excess global supply and subdued demand, companies can expect rising costs from petrochemicals industries, shortages of certain commodities, including sugar, rice, and wheat, and also wage pressures in some sectors because of the effective collective bargaining by employees.""Story continuesAugust 2023 Key Findings: DEMAND: Demand for raw materials, commodities and components continues to deteriorate at a similar pace to that seen in the other summer months, with little improvement seen at all in 2023. Europe led the downturn in purchasing, followed by North America.INVENTORIES: Global businesses continue to demonstrate little appetite for building up their stocks, with inventory managers unwilling to hold surplus stock.MATERIALS SHORTAGES: Supply shortages have ended, with reports of item scarcity now in line with historically normal levels.LABOR SHORTAGES: Labor shortages are having a limited impact on companies' ability to meet global demand, although manufacturers in Europe and North America have experienced some renewed issues with staff availability.TRANSPORTATION: Having fallen to their lowest since January 2016 in July, global transportation costs ticked higher in August amid rising pressures on oil prices.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY NORTH AMERICA: Index fell to -0.55 from -0.37 as demand for materials worsened and firms destocked again.EUROPE: Index rose from the global financial crisis low in July of -1.07 to -0.50, but nonetheless indicates a marked rise in supplier spare capacity.U.K.: Index was little changed in August at -0.92, versus -1.01 in July as the struggling European economy hits U.K. suppliers.ASIA: Index rose to 0.06, from -0.31, signalling a faint uptick in Asian supply chain volatility compared to July.For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long-Term Returns of Jana Partners' 5 Activist Targets. Billionaire Barry Rosenstein is one of the most prolific portfolio managers and the brains behind Jana Partners, one of Wall Street's most followed hedge funds. The activist investor mainly invests in companies that are undergoing a change or in need of operational improvement. He is best known for spearheading strategic changes in the race to unlock and maximize shareholders' value.Therefore, Jana Partners has been at the forefront in pushing for management and board changes in companies that appear to be trading below their fair value. In addition to pushing for leadership changes, the activist investor also calls for asset or unit sales in some activist campaigns as one of the ways of unlocking value. The changes are achieved mainly by pushing for board seats.Jana Partners also has a reputation for working collaboratively with boards and management behind the scenes. It often tries to avoid proxy fights in some situations while still trying to advocate changes that can maximize shareholders' value.A Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business graduate, Rosenstein founded Jana Partners in 2001 with $35 million in Capital. The hedge fund has evolved from a value-oriented firm to an event-driven one before becoming a full-blown activist hedge fund. It also runs a special purpose acquisition company (SPACS).While the hedge fund posted impressive results in the years following its inception in 2001, it has yet to see much better performance in recent years. It returned 7.9% in 2007, followed by a 23.4% loss in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. It did bounce back in 2009 with a 23.9% gain.Four years ago, Jana Partners closed its event-driven funds to primarily focus on activism, a decision that is slowly paying off.

For the 12-months ending in June 2023, dividends set a record $576.4 billion payment, up 6.2% on an aggregate basis from the 12-month June 2022's $542.1 billion.Total shareholders return of buybacks and dividends decreased to $318.1 billion in Q2 2023, down12.2% from Q1 2023's $362.3 billion and down 11.7% from Q2 2022's $360.2 billion. Total shareholder returns for the 12-months ending June 2023 decreased to $1.389 trillion from the 12-month June 2022 record $1.547 trillion.The new 1% excise tax on net buybacks, which started in 2023, reduced the Q2 2023 S&amp;P 500 operating earnings by 0.34% and As Reported GAAP earnings by 0.38%; the proforma for full year 2022 was a 0.51% reduction for operating and a 0.58% reduction for as reported.Story continues""Companies broadly reduced their buybacks in Q2 2023, as concerns over banking and a slowing economy dominated. Companies with strong cash-flow led the buybacks, as the top 20 issues accounted for 52%. Financials pulled back 30.2% after restarting their buybacks in Q1 2023 and following their 2022 pullback. Energy, which represented 4.1% of the equity market, represented 10.4% of the buybacks; Exxon and Chevron ranked in the top five for the quarter. The EPS impact, due to share count reduction, also declined with the value of buybacks now being re-evaluated with respect to its cost-support tradeoff. Still, 16.3% of the issues increased their Q2 2023 EPS year-over-year by at least 4% compared to 18.5% last quarter,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""Going forward and given the market's expectations that higher interest rates will continue for longer and new banking regulations will be implemented, buyback expenditure in excess of option coverage will be challenged for all but the top-tier cash-flow issues. Notably, and potentially adding to the cost further is the ongoing budget discussions and quest for government income as the new 1% buyback tax appears to be an attractive target from both sides of the aisle to increase.""1% Buyback Excise Tax for 2023:The new 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q2 2023 operating earnings by 0.34%, down from the Q1 2023 0.45%, and down from the proforma 0.52% for Q2 2022 and the proforma 2022 0.51%. As reported GAAP earnings were reduced by 0.38%, down from the Q1 2023 0.49%, down from the proforma 0.57% for Q2 2022, and the proforma 2022 0.58%.Silverblatt added: ""The 1% tax is an additional cost, but it is still not significant enough to impact the overall buybacks at this point. Given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support, there is an expectation that some increase and/or potential change to the type of buybacks that are taxed are on the table and will remain past the current budget discussions. An increase to the 2.5% area could start to impact buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction due to some of the expenditures shifting from buybacks to dividends. Any shift however would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis, as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets, and therefore move much slower.""Q2 2023 GICS® Sector Analysis:Information Technology regained the lead from Financials which took over the lead in Q1 2023 that Information Technology had held since Q3 2017. For Q2 2023 the sector increased their expenditure 2.6% to $47.1 billion, representing 26.9% of all S&amp;P 500 buybacks.

For the 12-month June 2023 period, Financials spent $125.2 billion, down from $189.3 billion for the 12-month June 2022 period.

Additionally, in honor of Hunger Action Month®, the world-class food company is donating 2.5 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 10 million servings of protein,* to ensure equitable access for communities experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity.""People are working hard to provide for themselves and their families, yet one in 10 Americans experience food insecurity, including nine million children,” said Erika Thiem, Chief Supply Chain Officer at Feeding America. “Tyson's continued partnership, and their focus on equitable access, brings us one step closer to an America where no one is hungry.”  Tyson Foods will allocate $800,000 of its donation to support Equitable Food Access grants which aim to improve access to nutritious food among people experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity.The remaining $1.7 million donation will support efforts to maintain and expand capacity of eight protein “pack rooms” across the Feeding America network of local food banks. Primarily used to repack bulk or private label protein products into family size quantities, protein pack rooms increase the types of protein that can easily be donated and distributed. Considering the high demand for perishable items, such as high-quality meat, food banks need the proper infrastructure to fulfill the food safety and temperature requirements for storing, repacking, and shipping fresh and frozen products.“At a time when millions of people across America face hunger, we’re proud to continue our partnership with Feeding America to help provide families and communities with access to nutritious, quality foods,” said Tim Grailer, senior director of social impact at Tyson Foods. “Hunger doesn’t have a season, but in September, we’re taking extra steps to raise awareness of food insecurity and show how much good food can do.”Story continuesSince 2020, Tyson Foods has donated more than 41 million pounds of protein valued at approximately $82 million to the Feeding America network of 200-member food banks, and 60,000 partner agencies, food pantries and meal programs. In the last year alone, the company has donated nearly 22 million pounds of protein – the equivalent of more than 85 million servings of protein* – to the Feeding America network. Donation events are scheduled throughout Hunger Action Month.Team Members Taking Steps to Alleviate HungerTeam members at the company’s world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas are demonstrating their commitment to Hunger Action Month by volunteering and tracking their fitness activities, such as walking, running or yoga as part of the “Living Well at Tyson Foods” initiative. The company will donate two pounds of protein per mile, or equivalent activity minutes, as well as a financial match from peer-to-peer fundraising as part of its collective mission to tackle hunger and promote well-being. The additional contributions will be totaled at the end of September and distributed to Feeding America, with the goal of donating more than one million pounds of protein. For campaign updates, visit The Tyson Foods Feed blog at https://thefeed.blog/.*Tyson estimates that 4 ounces of protein equates to one meal.About Tyson Foods, Inc. Tyson Foods, Inc.

The company’s numerous acquisitions are helping to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams.The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode. It is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital via share buybacks and dividend payments.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+64.1% vs. +38.9%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Momentum in SAP’s business technology platform particularly the S/4HANA solution along with opportunities presented by proliferation of generative AI bode well.SAP’s restructuring plan is expected to align its go-to-market approach with its accelerated cloud transformation. Frequent product launches like Grow with SAP, and strategic acquisitions and collaborations are other tailwinds.However, the company’s performance is affected by continued softness in the Software license and support business segment coupled with global macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical instability.

According to the Zacks analyst the company’s growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, sluggishness in the Analog segment remains a concern. Further, weakening momentum across enterprise systems and communication equipment end-markets is a negative. Additionally, weak demand environment and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and AT&amp;T Inc.Story continuesMedia ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

MA.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Splunk is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops and markets cloud services and licensed software solutions. The company enables enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data.The stock was a favorite back in 2020, but plummeted over 70% into the 2022 lows. But recently, investors have come back into the stock, helping SPLK almost double off those lows set back in October.The most recent catalyst was an earnings report that helped the stock jump 25% in just a couple weeks. So the question for investors now is if this strong momentum can continue and if Splunk can ever get back to those lofty 2020 highs.More About SplunkThe company incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It employs 8,000 and has a market cap of $20 billion.The company’s offerings enable users to investigate, monitor, analyze and act on machine data and big data, irrespective of format or source, and helps in operational decision making.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock scores an “F” in Value. The Forward PE is 33 and the stock pays no dividend.Q4 EarningsSplunk reported Q2 earnings in late August seeing an 84% EPS beat. The company also raised its full year outlook on the top and bottom line.Splunk guided Q3 revenue at $1.02-1.04B vs the $986M expected and guided FY24 revenues at $3.93-3.95B vs the $3.90B expected.Cloud revenue was up 29% y/y and operating margin was 16.7%, up from 3.6% last year.Their customer base is getting larger as well, with customer with ARR over $1M at 834, which is up 111 year over year.Story continuesEstimates SurgeWith the strong guidance, analysts were quick to hike estimates and lift price targets.For the current quarter, we see numbers go from $0.77 to $1.11, a jump of 44%.Next quarter has been flat, but looking at the current year and next year, we see analyst lifting numbers over the last 30 days.For the current year, we see estimates have ticked 20% higher going from $3.13 to $3.76. For next year we see a hike of 17%, with analysts lifting numbers from $3.60 to $4.22.Almost every analyst on the street lifted their price targets the day following earrings. Here are a few firms lifting targets:Wedbush- Reiterated SPLK with a Neutral, price target: $105 from $86 JPMorgan Chase- Reiterated SPLK with Neutral, price target: $120 from $100 RBC- Reiterated SPLK with Outperform, price target: $132 from $125  The Technical TakeSplunk was a post-covid favorite in 2020, hitting highs of $225. But it sold off over the last three years, with the stock falling to $65 before rallying to $125 recently.The stock is well off its lows, but investors should lower their expectations before thinking $200 is coming soon. It will take a while to repair all that damage and there will be resistance levels up above. Look for $140 and $175 to be issues to the upside.For those looking for an entry, below are some levels to watch:21-day Moving Average (MA): $11250-day MA: 108200-day MA: $97.50Fibonacci support (50%): $110 Fibonacci support (61.8%): $107The $107-110 area would be the buy zone with a lean against the 200-day MA.In SummaryWhile it is hard to chase a stock that is up 25% in the last month and almost 100% on the year, Splunk is certainly one to watch. On the fundamental side, the company is back on track when it comes to earnings and growth. On the technical side, there are buyable pullback setups that investors should be watching for.Bulls should be looking to accumulate shares at support levels and watch estimates for any big changes in expectations.Bear of the Day:Shoe Carnival is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a family footwear retailer in the United States.  The company offers a broad assortment of moderately priced dress, casual and athletic footwear for men, women, and children with emphasis on national and regional name brands.The stock has struggled all year, trading lower by about 13%. Investors must ask themselves why the stock is down when the overall market is up.The answer seems to be earnings, with the company missing two of the last three quarters.About the CompanyShoe Carnival is headquartered in Evansville, IN.The company was founded in 1978 and employs 2,500 people. It operates 404 stores in 33 states and Puerto Rico, and offers online shopping at its website.SCVL is valued at $600 million and has a Forward PE of 7. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but “F” in Growth. The stock pays a dividend of about 2%.Q4 EarningsShoe Carnival reported earnings in late August, missing expectations by 12%. Revenues were down year over year and they cut their outlook.For FY23, the company now sees $3.10-3.25 v the 3.60 expected. Same Store Sales are now expected at -8% to -6% v the -2% to +2% expected. The company cut new store expectations to 6-10 v the prior 10-20.Gross margin was an issue too, down 40bps year over year.In their back to school update the company said that “Market conditions continued to modestly improve in early third quarter 2023 versus second quarter 2023.” Management added that August sales and profits were close to record highs and margins were near records.While the back-to-school season seems to be doing well, estimates are coming down.EstimatesSince earnings analysts have lowered estimates.Over the last 30 days, numbers for the current quarter were cut from $1.28 to $1.02, or 25%.For the current year, analysts lowered estimates from $3.60 to $3.17, or 12%.Technical TakeWhen you zoom out on the SCVL chart something becomes very clear. The $20 level is very important.From 2018 to 2021 this was the resistance. The stock broke out in early 2021 and has come back to the $20 level where it has been supported.If this level breaks, the stock could see another leg lower to the $15 area.Looking at resistance, all the moving averages are above the current rpice. The 21-day is sloping lower and is currently under $23.The $24 level is where both the 50-day and 200-day reside. They are flat for now and would offer major resistance on any rally.In SummaryIt has been a tough year at the carnival, but the show must go on. The back-to-school report was positive, but the company needs a full quarter to change the trend in the stock.Bulls need to be cautious of the $20 level and for now, there seems to be better places to put money to work.Additional content:Low Cost vs. Compromised Security: The Payments Space DilemmaLate last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that payments technology juggernauts like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. intended to hike credit card fees paid by merchants when they accept cards from customers, which were expected to materialize in October and April. However, the companies avidly disagreed with the claims and painted a picture that asked some credible questions.CMSPI, a consulting firm, told the Wall Street Journal that the new fee structure will likely boost costs to merchants by an additional $502 million per year. More than half of that amount would come from network charges, while interchange fees, commonly known as swipe fees, were expected to provide the rest.Per Nilson Report, last year, U.S. merchants paid around $93 billion to Visa and Mastercard in credit-card fees, which surged from the 2012 level of $33 billion. It should also be noted that the volume of digital transactions has significantly jumped during this time, along with the revenues of the merchants.Mastercard stated that it has no intention of hiking network fees or interchange rates in the United States this fall. Visa said through a blog post that its overall interchange fees on its network remained flat for the past ten years. It also pointed out some programs it launched to reduce interchange fees. Last year, it decreased fees by 10% for 90% of businesses in the United States. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The PuzzleIncreased competition in the payment processing market can potentially reduce swipe fees for merchants, which the regulators and legislators have been talking about for some time (Credit Card Competition Act bill), but it can negatively impact security. As cheaper payment does not automatically translate to the same or higher level of security, which is already being provided by companies like V and MA, it can push merchants and other stakeholders in the payments space to increase fraud detection and security-related investments.With growing digital transactions, attempted frauds and security threats increased many folds, leading to higher demand for better and more effective security technologies and related R&amp;D, which comes with expensive price tags. It will likely be difficult for some smaller rivals to cough up such amounts from the get-go.Moreover, lower credit card processing fees can affect rewards programs and similar services. To compensate for lower revenues from processing fees, financial institutions, including credit card issuers can cut back rewards, which will impact the consumers.What About the Smaller Merchants?The legislators argue that the new measures will inject competition in the payments space through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks, which will likely increase the decision-making power of the merchants and break up the duopoly. This can reduce costs for merchants, which is crucial, especially for the smaller ones who were badly hurt during the pandemic and from inflationary pressures.Lower credit card fees are expected to provide some impetus to the margins of small businesses, which account for the vast majority of the total U.S. businesses. This is important, keeping in mind that the U.S. unemployment rate was at 3.8% in August, up from 3.5% at 2022-end. Although the latest rate is well below 5.2% witnessed in August 2021, it is still the highest since March 2022.As both sides have some valid points, all eyes are on the legislative developments waiting to see how the situation plays out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about MasterCard (MA).MasterCard currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 8.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for MasterCard here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying MasterCard, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for MasterCard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $12.13.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for MasterCard. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for MasterCard.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's innovations are used in mobile devices, networking equipment, broadband gateway equipment, consumer electronic devices, and more. Qualcomm's business model involves licensing its broad intellectual property portfolio and selling system chips.The insider transaction history for Qualcomm Inc shows a clear trend of more sells than buys.

This trend is illustrated in the following image:Insider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's Chief Commercial Officer James Cathey Sells 1,000 SharesThe relationship between insider trading activities and the stock price is complex. While it's not uncommon for insiders to sell their shares, a high volume of selling can sometimes indicate a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects. However, it's important to note that insiders sell shares for various reasons, and it doesn't necessarily mean they believe the stock's price will decline.On the day of the insider's recent sell, Qualcomm Inc's shares were trading at $111.27, giving the company a market cap of $124.47 billion.

129,4ffc0c8a-74db-34ef-835f-bed9db4c579e,QCOM,2023-09-13,Qualcomm (QCOM) to Supply 5G Modem Chips for Upcoming iPhones,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-qcom-supply-5g-modem-153700973.html,1694533020,STORY,"['QCOM', 'AAPL']","[QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM recently entered into a multi-year agreement with Apple Inc. AAPL for an undisclosed amount to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF systems for upcoming iPhone models. The specific valuation of the agreement, which is set to remain in effect until 2026, remains confidential. It highlights Qualcomm’s robust portfolio and its leadership position across 5G technologies and products.Apple had earlier given a strong indication of moving toward developing in-house technology and its acquisition of Intel’s modem business for $1 billion was a step forward in that direction. However, the volte-face portends that the chipmaker is perhaps not ready with its in-house production, forcing it to turn to its trusted supplier for the upcoming iPhone models.Moreover, Beijing is reportedly mulling to impose a ban on the use of iPhones in government offices and state-backed entities as part of its concerted effort toward self-reliance. Consequently, Apple is perhaps leaning toward its tried and tested model to tide over these challenging times, as China is one of its primary markets. The deal with Qualcomm has ensured a steady supply chain for 5G chips for the next three years.In addition to incremental revenues, the deal augments QCOM's leadership position across 5G technologies and products. The deal also gains significance as the chipmaker was expected to record softer revenues from China owing to strict restrictions of iPhone usage. However, the recent deal with Apple has largely negated this concern and has reposed investors' faith in the stock.Qualcomm's long-term financial planning assumes a 20% share of the chipset supply for smartphone launches in 2026. In the face of rising competition from other well-established players and the prevailing business uncertainties, the deal will likely provide a substantial competitive advantage for Qualcomm and enhance its prospects.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches. It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to super-fast 5G networks, delivering low-power resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and Qualcomm's best-in-class security. This, in turn, would further offer the flexibility and scalability needed for broad and fast 5G adoption through accelerated commercialization by OEMs.Qualcomm is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning both sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the largest RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. With the rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets, driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream.Shares of the company have lost 11.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 13.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderMotorola Solutions, Inc.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$123b last week after a 4.4% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 15% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell QUALCOMM which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of QUALCOMM. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in QUALCOMM. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at QUALCOMM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that QUALCOMM Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in QUALCOMM. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

The U.S. Army is the largest operator with 2,135 H-60 designated aircraft.Growth ProspectsIn recent times, U.S. military helicopters have gained prominence and significant traction due to advancements and integration of new tactical, logistical and other important features. Some of these developments can be attributed to Lockheed paving the way for securing valuable helicopter-related contracts of late. The recent contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, rising geopolitical and cross border conflicts prevalent across the globe have forced nations to increase their defense spending toward procuring new aircraft and helicopters to enhance their aerial capabilities. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2023-2028 period.Story continuesThis should significantly boost Lockheed as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military helicopter market with its portfolio containing programs like e Black Hawk, Seahawk and CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters.Opportunities for PeersOther defense companies that may enjoy the perks of the expanding military rotorcraft market are as follows:Boeing BA: The company’s military rotorcraft is renowned worldwide for its leading-edge, ready and relevant solutions that deliver proven capabilities.

Consequently, stock prices of most of the homebuilding stocks have seen an upsurge this year. Importantly, this turnaround has happened despite a high mortgage rate.As of Sep 12, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is hovering around 7.56%, up 3 basis points from a week ago. Similarly, average 30-year fixed mortgage refinance rate is around 7.75%, up 3 basis points from a week ago.Homebuilders, all through this year, have applied innovative strategies to attract potential buyers of new homes. They have kept affordable prices on the properties and offered mortgage rate buydowns. Shortage of existing homes in the housing market has also increased the requirement for newly constructed homes, eventually enhancing the sales figures for housebuilders.Solid Housing Sector DataThe U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development jointly reported that the privately-owned housing starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.452 million units, up 3.9% month over month and 5.9% year over year.Single-family housing starts, which mostly constitute the bulk of the construction, jumped 6.7% in July from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units. Likewise building permits in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.442 million units, up 0.1% month over month. Single-family building permits increased 0.6% month over month in July to 930,000 units.Sales of new single???family houses in July 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 714,000, up 4.4% month over month and jumped 31.5% year over year. The National Association of Realtors reported that pending home sales increased 0.9% in July — rising for the second consecutive month.Moreover, the Department of Commerce reported that the spending on construction projects were up 0.7% month over month in July. This was primarily driven by a 1.4% rise month over month in spending on residential construction projects.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five homebuilders with strong upside left.

While some investors will dismiss investing in the sector as reckless speculation, Warren Buffett is buying the sector. That’s not the only reason there may be a bullish setup for the best homebuilder stocks.  Earlier this summer Deutsche Bank described the housing market in the United States as underbuilt. One reason for this is the “great relocation” that continues to change the housing landscape. Single- and multi-family homes can’t get built fast enough in many of the hottest areas of the country.  Another reason is that the higher interest rates are keeping many existing homeowners in place. That puts homebuilders in a great position to fill the gap. If interest rates stay higher for longer, it will create a backlog that won’t be filled anytime soon. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe best news is that many of the best homebuilder stocks are undervalued. I many cases, these stocks create shareholder equity through reliable dividends and share repurchases.  D.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is one of the three stocks that Buffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought this summer. Of those three, DHI stock may be the most undervalued. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 8.6 times. It also is coming off an earnings report where it beat on the top and bottom lines. Revenue was also higher year-over-year.  One feature that makes D.R. Horton one of the best homebuilder stocks is the company’s ability to turn homes quickly. This matters because homebuilders usually rely on borrowed money to finance their builds. Having the ability to turn homes quickly can keep their debt level manageable in a higher-for-longer interest rate environment.  Analysts project D.R. Horton’s earnings to grow earnings by more than 5% in the next 12 months. That corresponds with analysts giving the stock a consensus price target of $145.35 that is 25.6% higher than the price as of September 5, 2023.  Story continuesLennar (LEN) Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockLennar (NYSE:LEN) Is another of the homebuilder stocks purchased by Berkshire Hathaway. One of Lennar’s key markets is Florida, which is still one of the fastest growing sectors of the homebuilding sector.  LEN stock is down from its all-time high which it reached in mid-July. That was after the company posted a double beat in its second quarter earnings report. Many analysts raised their price targets since that report. However, that may not be reflected in the company’s stock price which is down 7.6% in the last month. Not surprisingly, short interest is up more than 10% in that time.  However, Lennar stock is still an attractive buy that is trading at 9.5x forward earnings. It also pays a dividend with an attractive 1.3% yield and a track record of at least five consecutive years of dividend growth which puts it among the best among Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500 stocks.  PulteGroup (PHM) the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) was not one of the homebuilder stocks bought by Warren Buffett. However, it still makes this list of the best homebuilder stocks. The company is the third largest builder with a network that covers many of the hottest sectors in the country including Florida and Texas. Also, approximately 50% of the company’s homes built in 2022 closed at a price point below $500,000. At a time when the price of an average home continues to move higher, Pulte continues to build homes that are in the sweet spot for many prospective buyers.  Of the three stocks on this list, PulteGroup has the smallest forecasted earnings growth at just 0.8%. However, that isn’t keeping analysts away. The stock has an average price target of $98.38 which is 26% above the current price. A total of 14 out of 17 analysts give PHM stock a “Buy” or “Strong Buy” rating.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, inflationary pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 24.1% year to date compared with the industry's 4.7% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 17.2% in the same time frame.BAX, with a market capitalization of $19.58 billion, is a global medical technology company providing items such as kidney-dialysis equipment, infusion pumps and intravenous solutions. The company has an earnings yield of 6.6% compared with the industry's (1.8%). It anticipates earnings to improve 5.5% over the next five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving the Performance?Baxter International ended second-quarter 2023 with improvement in both earnings and revenues. Sales across all product categories were strong except for decline in Patient Support Systems, led by lower rental revenues. Robust growth rates across all geographies buoy optimism.The company expects the demand for its medically essential products to continue amid stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and healthcare marketplace. BAX stated that the ongoing transformational actions, announced earlier this year, will likely boost its performance going forward.The transformational actions, which include realigning its businesses and operations into four vertically integrated global business segments, are likely to be completed by July 2024. Baxter Internationalis also progressing with the proposed spin-off of its Kidney Care segment, comprising of Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories, into an independent, publicly traded company. This is also a part of BAX’s transformational actions.In the second quarter, revenues from continued operation totaled $3.71 billion, up 3% on a reported basis and 4% organically. Revenues from discontinued operation (BPS business) amounted to $142 million.Story continuesNotable DevelopmentsIn June, Baxter International announced the U.S. launch of its new Hillrom Progressa+ bed for the intensive care unit. Progressa+, which offers new technology and features, has been designed to make it easier for nurses to care for patients and support patient recovery.In May, BAX had signed an agreement to divest its BioPharma Solutions business for $4.25 billion. The divesture is expected to close in the second half of this year. The company started reporting the business as discontinued operations from the second quarter of 2023.What's Weighing on the Stock?Although recovering, the company continues to face pressure for services related to hospital admissions and procedural volumes. Supply-chain disruptions continue to hurt growth albeit slowly compared with the last few quarters. Lower rental revenues and reduced hospital capital spending continue to impact top-line growth. A decline in sales in China due to excess mortality on ESRD patient volumes due to the pandemic, coupled with the ongoing implementation of value-based procurement initiatives, continues to hurt sales in the country.Gross and operating profit declined year over year in the second quarter, reflecting inflationary pressure. Both gross and operating margins also contracted.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $14.83 billion, indicating a 1.9% decline from the previous year’s level. However, revenues are likely to recover in 2024 at an estimated growth rate of 4%.The consensus mark for adjusted EPS is pinned at $2.55, indicating a 27.1% decrease from the year-ago reported number. The consensus estimate for adjusted EPS has declined 1.9% in the past 30 days. However, EPS is likely to recover in 2024 at an estimated growth rate of 21.4%.Baxter International Inc.

If you want to skip our discussion on the pharma industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Pharma ETFs.As of 2023, Deloitte has valued the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technology industries at $2.83 trillion. A report on the Global Pharmaceuticals Outlook by Atradius highlights China’s emergence as a key player in the global pharmaceutical industry. The number of households in the country with an annual income of $35,000 is expected to increase from 65 million in 2020 to 152 million by 2026. This is expected to provide impetus to the demand for high-value pharmaceuticals. In addition to this, China’s aging population is also expected to drive demand and benefit some of the best pharma stocks, such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). You can also check out the 10 Best Small Cap Pharma Stocks to Buy here.Meanwhile, the US pharmaceutical market is observing a dynamic change as the country disclosed a pricing shift under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Medicare would now have the ability to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers and enforce inflationary rebates from pharmaceutical companies. According to the legislation, the US national insurer could potentially negotiate the prices for up to 10 drugs by 2026, and this number could increase to 60 by 2029. The IRA has given the power to the government to impose an excise duty of up to 95% on companies that do not engage in negotiations.Growth TrajectoryExperts believe that mergers and acquisitions could be a highlight for the pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) anticipates a series of deals falling within the $20 billion to $40 billion range in 2023, largely driven by the robust financial positions and liquidity of pharmaceutical companies. Experts in the field identify oncology and immunology as areas with substantial growth potential, which also emphasizes the investment opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry.Story continuesFor investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical sector, ETFs have proven to be a reliable option. Among these, the VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) has established a reputation as one of the top-performing ETFs over the past five years. Another ETF that has performed well in the past five years is the Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT), also known as Vanguard Pharma ETF amongst retail investors. Notably, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) holds the distinction of being the largest pharma ETF, featuring many prominent pharmaceutical industry names.

The best pharma ETFs also provide exposure to industries like biotechnology, clinical trials, and immunotherapy. The ETFs have been ranked in ascending order of their 5-year performance.12. iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 14.7%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $373.82 millionExpense Ratio: 0.40%iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) is managed by New York-based BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), which is one of the biggest asset management companies globally. Overall, the ETF has 40 holdings. The ETF intends to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones US Select Pharmaceuticals Index as it plans to invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of the underlying index.The three biggest holdings of the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) are Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS). Together, the three biggest holdings occupy 50.51% of the fund's portfolio.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”11. First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 15.6%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $22.56 millionExpense Ratio: 0.60%First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH) intends to replicate the performance of the underlying NASDAQ US Smart Pharmaceutical Index, with a correlation of 95%.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are the three biggest constituents of the ETF, representing 21.72% of the portfolio. Overall, First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH) has 45 holdings. Between 2017 and 2022, the ETF generated the highest annual return of 22.35% in 2019.10. Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 25.1%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $40.12 millionExpense Ratio: 0.50%Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR) is based on the mandate that average human lives are getting longer with every passing day. According to the forecasts presented by the World Health Organization (WHO) in October 2021, there would be 2 billion people above the age of 60 by 2050. As the senior population rises, especially in the Western hemisphere, they would require creative solutions that cater to their preferences. These diverse solutions are expected to have a significant impact across various sectors and strongly benefit the pharmaceutical industry.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519.T), and Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) are the three biggest holdings of the ETF, representing 11.85% of the portfolio. Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 25 funds held a stake in Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) as of Q2 2023.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC shared the following stance on Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC), the eye care devices, equipment and consumables provider, was also a leading contributor during the quarter. In addition to a backdrop of resilient and robust demand across all of its segments, Alcon’s focus on executing its commercial strategy, pricing improvements and product development demonstrates the strength of the business. As an innovative leader in the eye care industry, Alcon develops cutting‐edge products such as Total30, the first reusable lenses using water gradient technology created for astigmatic wearers, and the ARGOS Biometer, which enables surgeons to conduct 3D digital image‐ guided cataract surgery. Products such as these have allowed Alcon to further penetrate its primary end markets and win market share from competitors. While the company continues to navigate challenges such as inflation and supply‐chain inefficiencies, we believe Alcon’s prudent decisions that have helped maintain operational efficiency, its thoughtful approach to acquisitions, and the advantageous industry dynamics highlight the high‐quality nature of the company and the long‐term sustainability of its business model.”9. First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 26.87%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $1.52 billionExpense Ratio: 0.61%First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXH) tracks and replicates the performance of the StrataQuant Health Care AlphaDEX Index.The ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the companies involved in various aspects of the healthcare industry, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare providers.

The primary objective of the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF) is to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones US Select Healthcare Providers Index.7. VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 29.09%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $373.03 millionExpense Ratio: 0.36%VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) intends to track the performance of the MVIS US-Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index.

VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) has an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.22x for the past twelve months and an average 12-month price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.54x.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are the four biggest member constituents of the ETF and take up 22.38% of the portfolio.Here's what Rowan Street Capital said about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our current portfolio is made up of just 10 companies — we are very focused! We described our ‘10-Player All-Star Team’ philosophy in our Q1 2018 Letter (we encourage you to review it). We have been building this portfolio since our founding in 2015. In total, over the past 8 years, we bought stock in 47 different companies (that’s ~6 per year), and obviously, for anyone who is good at arithmetic, we sold 37 of them (~4.6 per year). We are constantly trying to learn from every decision (good or bad) that we make. We went through every position that we’ve sold since 2015 and analyzed how we would have done had we held on to those positions. The top 3 performing positions would have been: Chipotle (CMG) +630%, Tractor Supply (TSCO) +315% and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) +387%. Your managers are at fault here because we sold all of these (in 2017-18) for non-fundamental reasons. All of these continued to be great businesses and management has executed at very high levels. In all three cases, we made a decision to sell because we thought the stock price got way ahead of itself.Our main take-away lesson has to be Do NOT sell your winners and avoid adding more to your losers. Or as Peter Lynch once famously put it: “Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.”We were fortunate to purchase CMG, TSCO and NVO at very attractive prices when these companies hit a temporary speed bump in their business. These were businesses that were simple to understand and we knew them very well as we had a chance to study them thoroughly for some time prior to our purchase. However, when you choose to sell you get the cash proceeds. First, you have to pay the capital gains tax and then you have to make another ‘buy decision’ or, in a lot of cases, a number of them. The more decisions you make, the higher probability that you will make mistakes. More often than not, you end up buying a business that you know less well and end up partnering with the management team, whose character, management and capital allocation abilities may still be somewhat moot to you. These things take time to get comfortable with! As we have learned many times over throughout our investing careers, it is usually significantly more profitable and also more enjoyable to stay with the great business that you know very well and have a high confidence level in their management team. And this is exactly what happened with CMG, TSCO and NVO. It was a costly mistake for our investors and it’s an extremely valuable lesson that we have learned.”6. Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 37.96%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $20.13 billionExpense Ratio: 0.10%Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT) is offered by Vanguard Group, one of the world's largest and most well-known investment management companies.

Sandoz entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Samsung Bioepis to commercialize biosimilar SB17.Biosimilar SB17 is an investigational biosimilar of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s JNJ Stelara (ustekinumab). Stelara is approved for the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including Crohn's disease, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Sales of the drug came in at $5.2 billion.Per the terms, Sandoz will obtain exclusive rights to commercialize the biosimilar SB17 in the United States, Canada, the EEA, Switzerland and the U.K. The other specific terms of the agreement were not disclosed.Phase I study results on the biosimilar demonstrated that SB17 matches reference drug in terms of pharmacokinetic bioequivalence, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. Phase III study results will be presented at a medical congress later this year.Sandoz has a leading portfolio with eight marketed biosimilars and a pipeline of various compounds in various stages of development.Per the release, the deal will further strengthen its immunology franchise and Sandoz now expects to have five potential high-value upcoming biosimilar launches over the next few years.In May, J&amp;J settled litigation with Amgen, as a result of which J&amp;J does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of Stelara until Jan 2025.Shares of Novartis have risen 9.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 9.1% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNovartis previously announced that it planned to spin off Sandoz into a new publicly traded standalone company following a strategic review. The company will conduct a meeting for its shareholders on Sep 15, 2023, in relation to the proposed 100% spin-off of its generic and biosimilar business, Sandoz.Last month, the FDA approved Tyruko (natalizumab-sztn), a biosimilar of Biogen’s BIIB leading multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Tysabri. Per Sandoz, Tyruko is the first and only FDA-approved biosimilar for relapsing forms of MS.Story continuesTysabri is one of the leading drugs in Biogen’s strong MS portfolio, which also comprises Tecfidera, Vumerity, Avonex, Plegridy and Fampyra. Sales of Tysabri came in at $955.9 million in the first half of 2023. Hence, the biosimilar approval provides a strong opportunity for Sandoz.In August 2023, Sandoz announced positive results from the phase III MYLIGHT confirmatory efficacy and safety study for the biosimilar of Eylea (aflibercept) in patients with wet macular degeneration. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint and showed no clinically meaningful differences to Eylea. Sandoz expects to file for regulatory approval for biosimilar aflibercept in the United States and the EU in the coming months.Concurrently, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue the development of GT005 in geographic atrophy secondary to dry-age-related macular degeneration. This decision was based on a recommendation from the independent Data Monitoring Committee following an overall benefit-risk assessment of available data from the program studies, which concluded futility criteria had been met. No new safety signals were identified.The company is conducting a voluntary nationwide recall at the consumer level of one lot of its Sandimmune Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP), 100 mg/mL, in the United States due to crystal formation observed in some bottles, which could potentially result in incorrect dosing.Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Study investigators also reported that the combination extended median PFS by nearly nine months.AstraZeneca did not report any data on overall survival, the study’s secondary endpoint, claiming the data to be immature. However, management claimed that the combination treatment demonstrated a favorable trend.Currently, Tagrisso is the current first-line standard of care for EFGRm NSCLC. It is currently approved for three indications in the EFGRm NSCLC set by the FDA.Some analysts also noted that the above result sets a new bar for Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. J&amp;J is currently evaluating the combination of its own EFGR/MET-targeted antibody therapy Rybrevant (amivantamab) and oral EFGR inhibitor lazertinib against Tagrisso alone in first-line EFGRm NSCLC in the pivotal phase III MARIPOSA study. J&amp;J is expected to report data from this study before this year’s end.AstraZeneca’s shares have lost 1.8% year to date against the industry’s 9.1% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a separate press release, AstraZeneca also reported positive results from the phase III MANDARA study evaluating a head-to-head comparison of Fasenra (benralizumab) against GSK’s GSK Nucala (mepolizumab) in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (“EGPA”).Story continuesThe MANDARA study achieved its primary endpoint. Data from the study showed that a single monthly injection of 30mg Fasenra achieves remission rates comparable to GSK’s Nucala, the current standard of care for EGPA patients.AstraZeneca plans to report complete data from the study at a future medical meeting.Currently, GSK’s Nucala is the only FDA-approved treatment for EGPA indication. The GSK drug requires monthly administration of three separate subcutaneous injections at 100mg.Fasenra is approved in the United States as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma (“SEA”). The FDA granted orphan drug designation to Fasenra for EGPA in 2018.An FDA approval to Fasenra in EGPA will likely benefit AstraZeneca in a target market that GSK is currently dominating. Also, Fasenra’s administration at a lower dosage than GSK’s Nucala and at lesser intervals is likely to benefit AstraZeneca in the long run.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC PriceAstraZeneca PLC price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderAstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

146,5df756f9-1b2a-3a64-b29a-972848bdd99f,MRK,2023-09-13,Is Merck (NYSE:MRK) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-nyse-mrk-risky-investment-110108433.html,1694602868,STORY,['MRK'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Merck What Is Merck's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Merck had debt of US$36.9b, up from US$31.7b in one year. However, it does have US$6.38b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$30.5b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Merck's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Merck had liabilities of US$23.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$42.3b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$6.38b in cash and US$12.3b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$47.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded Merck shares are worth a very impressive total of US$275.6b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.We'd say that Merck's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.5), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 17.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. Importantly, Merck's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 52% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Merck can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Merck generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 83% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewMerck's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. Considering this range of data points, we think Merck is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Merck , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our discussion on the pharma industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Pharma ETFs.As of 2023, Deloitte has valued the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technology industries at $2.83 trillion. A report on the Global Pharmaceuticals Outlook by Atradius highlights China’s emergence as a key player in the global pharmaceutical industry. The number of households in the country with an annual income of $35,000 is expected to increase from 65 million in 2020 to 152 million by 2026. This is expected to provide impetus to the demand for high-value pharmaceuticals. In addition to this, China’s aging population is also expected to drive demand and benefit some of the best pharma stocks, such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). You can also check out the 10 Best Small Cap Pharma Stocks to Buy here.Meanwhile, the US pharmaceutical market is observing a dynamic change as the country disclosed a pricing shift under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Medicare would now have the ability to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers and enforce inflationary rebates from pharmaceutical companies. According to the legislation, the US national insurer could potentially negotiate the prices for up to 10 drugs by 2026, and this number could increase to 60 by 2029. The IRA has given the power to the government to impose an excise duty of up to 95% on companies that do not engage in negotiations.Growth TrajectoryExperts believe that mergers and acquisitions could be a highlight for the pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) anticipates a series of deals falling within the $20 billion to $40 billion range in 2023, largely driven by the robust financial positions and liquidity of pharmaceutical companies. Experts in the field identify oncology and immunology as areas with substantial growth potential, which also emphasizes the investment opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry.Story continuesFor investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical sector, ETFs have proven to be a reliable option. Among these, the VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) has established a reputation as one of the top-performing ETFs over the past five years. Another ETF that has performed well in the past five years is the Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT), also known as Vanguard Pharma ETF amongst retail investors. Notably, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) holds the distinction of being the largest pharma ETF, featuring many prominent pharmaceutical industry names.

The best pharma ETFs also provide exposure to industries like biotechnology, clinical trials, and immunotherapy. The ETFs have been ranked in ascending order of their 5-year performance.12. iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 14.7%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $373.82 millionExpense Ratio: 0.40%iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) is managed by New York-based BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), which is one of the biggest asset management companies globally. Overall, the ETF has 40 holdings. The ETF intends to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones US Select Pharmaceuticals Index as it plans to invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of the underlying index.The three biggest holdings of the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) are Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS). Together, the three biggest holdings occupy 50.51% of the fund's portfolio.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”11. First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 15.6%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $22.56 millionExpense Ratio: 0.60%First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH) intends to replicate the performance of the underlying NASDAQ US Smart Pharmaceutical Index, with a correlation of 95%.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are the three biggest constituents of the ETF, representing 21.72% of the portfolio. Overall, First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH) has 45 holdings. Between 2017 and 2022, the ETF generated the highest annual return of 22.35% in 2019.10. Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 25.1%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $40.12 millionExpense Ratio: 0.50%Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR) is based on the mandate that average human lives are getting longer with every passing day. According to the forecasts presented by the World Health Organization (WHO) in October 2021, there would be 2 billion people above the age of 60 by 2050. As the senior population rises, especially in the Western hemisphere, they would require creative solutions that cater to their preferences. These diverse solutions are expected to have a significant impact across various sectors and strongly benefit the pharmaceutical industry.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519.T), and Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) are the three biggest holdings of the ETF, representing 11.85% of the portfolio. Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 25 funds held a stake in Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) as of Q2 2023.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC shared the following stance on Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC), the eye care devices, equipment and consumables provider, was also a leading contributor during the quarter. In addition to a backdrop of resilient and robust demand across all of its segments, Alcon’s focus on executing its commercial strategy, pricing improvements and product development demonstrates the strength of the business. As an innovative leader in the eye care industry, Alcon develops cutting‐edge products such as Total30, the first reusable lenses using water gradient technology created for astigmatic wearers, and the ARGOS Biometer, which enables surgeons to conduct 3D digital image‐ guided cataract surgery. Products such as these have allowed Alcon to further penetrate its primary end markets and win market share from competitors. While the company continues to navigate challenges such as inflation and supply‐chain inefficiencies, we believe Alcon’s prudent decisions that have helped maintain operational efficiency, its thoughtful approach to acquisitions, and the advantageous industry dynamics highlight the high‐quality nature of the company and the long‐term sustainability of its business model.”9. First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 26.87%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $1.52 billionExpense Ratio: 0.61%First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXH) tracks and replicates the performance of the StrataQuant Health Care AlphaDEX Index.The ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the companies involved in various aspects of the healthcare industry, such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and healthcare providers.

(NASDAQ:VTRS), and Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) are the three biggest holdings of First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEARCA:FXH). Collectively, these three companies account for 6.64% of the total holdings.8. iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 27.15%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $998.33 millionExpense Ratio: 0.40%iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF) seeks to track the investment results of US equities in the healthcare providers sector. It is another ETF on our list of the best pharma ETFs that are managed by BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK). The primary objective of the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEARCA:IHF) is to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones US Select Healthcare Providers Index.7. VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 29.09%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $373.03 millionExpense Ratio: 0.36%VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) intends to track the performance of the MVIS US-Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Index. Excluding cash, the ETF has 25 holdings. VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) has an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.22x for the past twelve months and an average 12-month price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.54x.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are the four biggest member constituents of the ETF and take up 22.38% of the portfolio.Here's what Rowan Street Capital said about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our current portfolio is made up of just 10 companies — we are very focused! We described our ‘10-Player All-Star Team’ philosophy in our Q1 2018 Letter (we encourage you to review it). We have been building this portfolio since our founding in 2015. In total, over the past 8 years, we bought stock in 47 different companies (that’s ~6 per year), and obviously, for anyone who is good at arithmetic, we sold 37 of them (~4.6 per year). We are constantly trying to learn from every decision (good or bad) that we make. We went through every position that we’ve sold since 2015 and analyzed how we would have done had we held on to those positions. The top 3 performing positions would have been: Chipotle (CMG) +630%, Tractor Supply (TSCO) +315% and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) +387%. Your managers are at fault here because we sold all of these (in 2017-18) for non-fundamental reasons. All of these continued to be great businesses and management has executed at very high levels. In all three cases, we made a decision to sell because we thought the stock price got way ahead of itself.Our main take-away lesson has to be Do NOT sell your winners and avoid adding more to your losers. Or as Peter Lynch once famously put it: “Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.”We were fortunate to purchase CMG, TSCO and NVO at very attractive prices when these companies hit a temporary speed bump in their business. These were businesses that were simple to understand and we knew them very well as we had a chance to study them thoroughly for some time prior to our purchase. However, when you choose to sell you get the cash proceeds. First, you have to pay the capital gains tax and then you have to make another ‘buy decision’ or, in a lot of cases, a number of them. The more decisions you make, the higher probability that you will make mistakes. More often than not, you end up buying a business that you know less well and end up partnering with the management team, whose character, management and capital allocation abilities may still be somewhat moot to you. These things take time to get comfortable with! As we have learned many times over throughout our investing careers, it is usually significantly more profitable and also more enjoyable to stay with the great business that you know very well and have a high confidence level in their management team. And this is exactly what happened with CMG, TSCO and NVO. It was a costly mistake for our investors and it’s an extremely valuable lesson that we have learned.”6. Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 37.96%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $20.13 billionExpense Ratio: 0.10%Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT) is offered by Vanguard Group, one of the world's largest and most well-known investment management companies.

Companies that make lifesaving medications or develop treatments to ease symptoms can be true moneymakers. Finding the best pharma stocks to buy is well worth your time and effort.But finding the right pharma stocks to buy can be tricky. You have to be comfortable with some fundamental truths about pharma stocks before you can decide if this is a good investment for you.Pharma stocks are heavily affected by regulation. In the U.S., drugs don’t make it to market without approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The European Union, the U.K., China and other countries have their own regulators. Waiting for approval can be painful for an investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven more painful is the extensive research and development window for a new drug. There’s no such thing as a quick profit when new treatments have to go through multiple rounds of tests and clinical trials. At any point, a drug could fail a trial, sinking its prospects.Of course, once the drug is approved, then the profits come. Drugs that enjoy patent protection mean that the company can expect significant revenue without having to worry about a generic competitor.But remember, patent protection doesn’t last forever, which means drug companies need to maintain a strong pipeline of potential drugs to develop.Pharma stocks can be a great investment, particularly if they have solid performance, revenue growth and a positive outlook. Here are seven pharma stocks to buy that meet those criteria.MannKind (MNKD)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comMannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) makes and commercializes products and devices for people who have endocrine and orphan lung diseases.Its products include Afrezza, an inhaled insulin treatment for people with diabetes that’s already approved for U.S. use and is awaiting international approvals. It also makes Tivaso, a dry powdered inhaler that’s approved by regulators.Story continuesSecond-quarter earnings sent the company’s stock up by nearly 20% in a single day when it was released in August. Revenue of $48.6 million was up from $18.9 million a year ago. The company nearly broke even, trimming its loss to less than $400,000. A year ago in the same quarter, MannKind lost $29 million.The concept of an inhaled insulin treatment rather than a shot is appealing, and the company’s sales bode well for the future. MNKD stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader, making it one of the more solid pharma stocks to buy.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comThings can change pretty quickly in the stock market. Just a few months ago, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was on my list of dividend stocks to avoid because of unimpressive performance that pushed the price close to a 52-week low. Now it’s on this list of pharma stocks to buy.The company got a huge bump from its second-quarter earnings report, bouncing close to 10% in a day. Earnings of $2.80 per share were much better than expectations of $2.62 per share. Revenue of $25.53 billion was up 6.3% from a year ago.The company also expressed confidence that growth would continue for the rest of the year. JNJ raised its 2023 outlook to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 per share, up from its previous prediction of $10.60 to $10.70 per share.JNJ stock is up 4% from March, and it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Biogen (BIIB)BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn SwitzerlandSource: PictureDesignSwiss / Shutterstock.comBiogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is another pharma stock that had a great reversal of fortune in the last year. In August 2022, Biogen actually had an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.But as we discussed, pharma stocks are very reliant on regulatory approvals, and Biogen is on the move after it got approval this summer from the FDA for its Alzheimer’s drug, Leqembi.The drug is said to be the first treatment that reduces cognitive decline in people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimer’s is an awful disease affecting more than 6 million in the U.S. alone. As dementia sets in, affecting memory, thinking and behavior, Alzheimer’s eventually destroys memory and thinking skills. Analysts say Biogen could bring in $12.9 billion in sales by 2030.Biogen also plans to buy Reata Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RETA), which would give it rights to Skyclarys, which is a promising treatment for the neurogenerative condition Friedrich’s ataxia. Skyclarys already has approval from the FDA and is projected to bring in annual sales of $1.5 billion.BIIB stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comUnlike some other names on this list, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (NYSE:LLY) is not a comeback story. This blue-chip pharmaceutical stock has a solid track record and has been on my “buy” list for a while.Lilly investors are playing the waiting game for the FDA to approve the company’s diabetes drug Mounjaro to treat obesity. But the wait will be worth it; 42% of U.S. adults are considered to be obese, and a drug that can help them melt away the pounds is expected to bring LLY as much as $25 billion in annual revenues.Mounjaro already brings in $1 billion in sales each quarter as a diabetes drug, but doctors are already prescribing it, in some cases to their patients for obesity.Q2 earnings were $8.31 billion in revenue and $2.11 per share in profits, both beating expectations for $7.61 billion and $2 per share.LLY stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.ImmunoGen (IMGN)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageImmunoGen (NASDAQ:IMGN) is one of the better biotech stocks that you can buy today.The company’s stock is up 215% in 2023, and that’s even after a slight dip over the last two months. ImmunoGen still has plenty left in the tank.The company develops antibody-drug conjugate technology to treat cancer. ADCs are toxins that kill cancer when attached to a biodegradable linker to a specific antibody.The trick is to find the correct toxin and correct antibody and match it to a biodegradable linker that works. But when effective, ImmunoGen can develop ADCs that are tolerable to cancer patients and attack the cancer.Its ovarian cancer drug, Elahere, is already on the market and ImmunoGen is working on getting approvals for it to be used for other types of cancer.IMGN stock gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Source: ShutterstockMerck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) is a major pharma stock, making everything from medicines and vaccines to animal health products.Two of its biggest sellers are Keytruda, a cancer immunotherapy drug, and Gardasil, which is used to treat human papillomavirus (HPV).With a market capitalization of $276 billion, Merck has deep pockets, which it uses to fund extensive research and keep its pipeline of future drug candidates strong.Currently, Merck has more than 30 programs in Phase 3 testing and more than 80 in Phase 2 testing. Its drug candidates treat cancer, hypertension, schizophrenia, Dengue fever and more.Merck topped analysts’ expectations for revenue in the second quarter, bringing in $15.04 billion versus expectations for $14.45 billion. But the company also posted a loss of $2.06 per share, thanks to its purchase of Prometheus Biosciences. The $10.8 billion deal was completed in June.The deal adds Prometheus’ pipeline to its own and now includes Prometheus’ top candidate, which is a potential treatment for ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and autoimmune disorders.MRK stock is down 4% so far this year, but it also pays a solid dividend of 2.6%. It has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Novo Nordisk (NVO)Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate buildingSource: joreks / Shutterstock.comNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a Danish biotechnology company that is best known for its work in helping people manage symptoms of diabetes.The company has made more than 600 million insulin pens, producing roughly half of the global supply.It also makes the successful weight loss drug Wegovy and a diabetes drug, Ozempic, which is becoming a popular alternative as an obesity treatment. It launched Wegovy in the U.K. in September, despite concerns that the drug was so popular that Novo Nordisk wouldn’t be able to keep up with demand.The company said sales in the first half of the year were up 30% from a year ago to $15.9 million. Profits were up 43%. Novo Nordisk issued guidance for full-year operating profit of 31% to 37%, and sales growth of 27% to 33%.NVO stock is up 41% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in LLY and NVO.

This order will significantly boost Boeing’s revenue growth from its commercial aerospace business.The 737 MAX caters to the single-aisle market with enhanced efficiency, improved environmental performance and increased passenger comfort. This aircraft’s fuel usage and carbon emissions are reduced by 20%, and it has a smaller noise footprint than other airplanes. The jets also offer increased comfort and relaxation for passengers, with modern technologies, greater space and larger pivoting overhead storage bins.Such remarkable features must have bolstered demand for this jet family over the past few years. Since launch, 100 customers worldwide have placed orders for more than 5,600 737 MAX airplanes. Coming to the company’s latest achievements in this space, in September 2023, it finalized an order for 13 jets from Aviation Capital Group LLC and 25 jets from SMBC Aviation Capital.Prospects in Asia-Pacific Aviation MarketAs we continue to witness steady growth in air traffic over the past few months, the Asia Pacific region has emerged as a forerunner when it comes to regional dominance. Per a recent report by the International Transport Association, published in September 2023, Asia Pacific's airlines held the largest share of the global fleet at 33%. A 15% annual increase in new planes is projected to be witnessed in the region in 2023.Boeing’s report estimates that by 2040, air travel within Asia Pacific markets will account for nearly half of global air traffic, driving 20-year demand for 17,645 new airplanes valued at $3.1 trillion. With its established presence in the Asia Pacific, further enhanced by the 190 737 Max order from Air India this June, along with the latest commitment from Vietnam Airlines, Boeing’s profitability should increase in the coming days. Boeing also has a deal with VietJet for the delivery of 200 of its 737 MAX planes.Story continuesOpportunities for PeersA few other aerospace players that can gain from the expanding aviation market in the Asia Pacific region are Airbus SE EADSY, General Dynamics Corp. GD and RTX Corp. RTX.Airbus’ one-third of the total order book comes from the Asia Pacific region. Currently, there are more than 4,000 Airbus aircraft in the fleets of more than 100 operators across the region.  In June 2023, Airbus received a purchase agreement from Philippine Airlines for nine A350-1000 aircraft and another order from Air India for delivering 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%.

But for every winner there is often a loser.These nations, companies and groups are unlikely to benefit from closer relations between Washington and Hanoi:CHINAVietnam has been careful to stress that its elevated ties with Washington would not upset relations with Beijing, fearing a backlash from China.But Washington's elevation to the same tier as Beijing in Vietnam's ranking will inevitably have an impact on China.Beijing could lose business deals, especially in the semiconductors field, where Washington pledged to boost Vietnam's industry with the explicit goal of reducing the sector's exposure to China-related risks.""China believes that the development of bilateral relations between countries cannot target third parties,"" China's foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday, urging the U.S. to ""abandon hegemony and Cold War thinking"".RUSSIAVietnam is a close partner of Russia and one of the top importers of its weapons, which are estimated to comprise about 80% of the Southeast Asian country's arsenal.The White House had no new arms deals to announce, but the new ties may facilitate future supplies from the U.S. or its partners.That would inevitably reduce Vietnam's reliance on Russian gear, although Hanoi is currently negotiating a new possible arms deal with Moscow.AIRBUSDuring U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi, U.S. planemaker Boeing agreed to sell 50 of its 737 MAX jets to flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.The Vietnamese company currently operates narrowbody jets from Airbus, Boeing's direct rival.The deal marked what is known in the industry as a ""flip"" - when either Boeing or Airbus poach a customer from each other, especially in the ultra-competitive narrowbody market.Story continuesSuch defections are relatively rare because of the expense of introducing new pilot training and spare parts, as well as the complexity of switching to a new fleet.""We do not have any comment on a decision that does not involve Airbus,"" an Airbus spokesperson said. ""However, Vietnam Airlines is an important customer and we look forward to building further on our long-standing partnership.""HUMAN RIGHTSThe White House fact sheet issued during Biden's visit weighed in at over 2,600 words. The section on human rights contained just 112 words, including a sub-heading.""The Biden administration is clearly sidelining human rights in the interest of advancing partnerships with governments it sees as strategically important,"" said Carolyn Nash, Asia advocacy director at Amnesty International.Vietnam holds at least 159 political prisoners and at least 22 others were in detention pending eventual trial before a court controlled by the ruling Communist Party, Human Rights Watch said.The two countries agreed on Sunday on ""enhanced commitment to meaningful dialogue"".MALAYSIA AND INDIAWashington has agreed to significantly boost support to Vietnam's chip and artificial intelligence industry, announcing new investments from U.S. companies, including a $1.6 billion semiconductors factory to be built by Amkor, and partnerships between U.S. AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft and Vietnamese companies.That could affect Malaysia and India, Vietnam's top rivals among emerging Asian nations in semiconductors and AI, respectively.AES AND SIEMENSAmong the deals announced by the White House was a partnership between solar company AMI and U.S. conglomerate Honeywell to launch ""Vietnam's first ever battery energy storage system"".That may have not pleased Fluence, a Nasdaq-listed company whose parent organisations are U.S. energy firm AES and Germany's Siemens that produces battery energy storage systems in Vietnam through a supplier.At the moment, its Vietnam output is exported.Fluence and Siemens did not reply to requests for comment.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, over the last three years, a private jet has been chartered around 400 times near his two homes—a waterfront estate on Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire and a house in a gated resort community in Buffalo, South Carolina.Calhoun is required to use Boeing-supplied private jets for all of his travel, both for business and personal reasons, due to security concerns. While flight logs do not specify whether these trips were for business or leisure, some flights did include visits to Boeing's Arlington location.Some top execs don't even bother with that.The aircraft manufacturer’s Chief Finance Officer, Brian West, also hasn't relocated to be near the company's Arlington base.Instead, Boeing opened a small office five minutes away from his home in Connecticut.Boeing told the WSJ that its Canaan premise, where West occasionally works from, was necessary to recruit the company’s new treasurer, David Whitehouse who lives around 30 minutes away.When a WSJ reporter visited the New Canaan, Conn. office that opened this spring, West, who is Boeing’s second-highest-ranking executive, was reportedly casually dressed in a polo shirt, shorts and slip-on shoes.Human resources chief Michael D’Ambrose, who joined Boeing in mid-2020, operates from a company facility near Orlando.Leadership team rulesA spokesperson told Fortune that the firm’s top executives do enjoy more perquisites than lower-ranking personnel, like private jets, but that there is no company-wide mandate to come in and that any RTO requests have been made on a team-by-team basis. However, they wouldn't expand on how many team members have been asked to go in.Story continues“We have been transforming our leadership culture to encourage our management team to engage more frequently with employees, customers and other stakeholders,"" a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement while adding that it's why the leadership team is empowered to spend less time sitting at a desk.""As with many companies, we have introduced more flexibility across multiple levels to enable people to work in ways that are most productive and supportive of our global business, and we’re pleased that this approach has allowed us to attract top talent across disciplines as we continue to execute our recovery plans.”Still, the leadership team's decision to work remotely after taking measures to entice its workforce back to the office—including happy hours and visiting alpacas—hasn’t washed down well with everyone.""What's he doing? Is he like at Lake Sunapee or something in New Hampshire?"" Jim Cramer called out the CEO's apparent absence on CNBC in 2021.Since then, several Boeing employees have begun displaying ironic ""Lake Sunapee"" signs in their cubicles, as well as souvenir mugs like one that read, ""Love Lake Life”, according to the WSJ.Boeing’s bosses represent a wider trendBoeing’s remote-working bosses are a familiar story for workers across the globe who are being encouraged to return to the office while their superiors conspicuously remain absent: McKinsey research revealed that high-earning mid-to-senior-level employees worldwide are digging in their heels when it comes to letting go of the pandemic-induced shift to working from home.McKinsey surveyed 13,000 office workers in six countries and found that the largest share of employees who strongly prefer to work from home were those who earn more than $150,000.In fact, 33% of employees who earn over $150,000 said they would quit their high-paying job altogether if their boss demanded them to come into the office five days a week. What’s more, this cohort of seasoned professionals would even take a 20% pay cut to be able to have a say in where and when they work.“Their seniority and high incomes suggest that they are probably decision makers who can protect remote work at the team or company level,” the researchers concluded.However, Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and author of a recent book about remote work, The Future of the Office, warned the WSJ that leaders who defy their own return to work policies risk looking out of step.“If you want people to come back and you’re not doing it, that really undermines the message,” Cappelli cautioned.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

By comparison, European rival Airbus has delivered 433 aircraft over the first eight months, 52 of those in August.Last month's deliveries included only 22 narrowbody 737s MAXs, of which one was a Boeing Business Jet. Boeing CFO Brian West said on Thursday that the company would be on the ""low end"" of its 400-450 target for 737 deliveries this year due to the extensive process used to inspect and fix thousands of misdrilled holes on the 737 MAX 8 aft pressure bulkhead.The company booked new orders for 43 planes after factoring in two cancellations. The total for the month includes a previously unannounced sale of 25 737 MAX 8 planes to aircraft lessor SMBC Aviation Capital. Airbus sold 117 planes in August.In addition to the MAX, Boeing handed over 13 widebody jets including five 787 Dreamliners, three 767s - including three KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force and two freighters for FedEx - as well as three 777 freighters.Investors closely watch delivery numbers, as airplane makers receive the majority of payment for an aircraft when it is transferred to a customer.Boeing's gross orders since the start of January rose to 624 in August, or 510 net orders after factoring in cancellations and conversions and 737 net orders after accounting adjustments.

The price-earnings ratio stands at 24.33, higher than both the industry median of 15.19 and the company's historical median. This suggests that the stock may be overvalued compared to its earnings.Story continuesInsider Sell: Southern Nuclear CEO Stephen Kuczynski Sells 5,000 Shares of Southern Co (SO)However, the GuruFocus Value of Southern Co is $76.10, indicating a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.89.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nike (NKE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 61.5% and 11.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NKE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $3.71.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nike. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nike with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ZION) experienced its most promising day since July, with a notable increase in net interest income. In contrast, Northern Trust (NTRS) reported an unexpected decline in net interest income. Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and Julie Hyman provide an analysis of the regional banking sector and how it could have an effect on commercial real estate and future interest rates.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Some of the movers or the top movers of the day. And we're watching regional banks following updates from the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. Zions Bancorp seeing its best day since July, as the company reported higher net interest income in July and August.But it wasn't all good news. Northern Trust underselling pressure as it warned of a bigger than expected decline in net interest income. Julie, the backdrop to all of this is we're talking about these particular banks today, but it really is about a cloud that's been hanging over regional banks overall.You look at where the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF has performed, it's down 25% year to date. And there's still a lot of questions, especially around commercial real estate. There was that big headline coming out of The Journal a few days ago about the doom loop that could potentially happen, the exposure that some of these regional banks have in that area, whether that could create a domino effect. Of course, all of this stemming from the concerns that happened earlier this year with SVB and the collapse there.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, the conversation seems to have shifted to some extent from deposits, which was really centered on what happened with SVB and the others and was there a big hit to deposits in the wake of that, and more focused on what is on the balance sheet, which also goes back to SVB, right? Are there big unrealized losses for some of these banks related to commercial real estate, related to other holdings that they have, related even to things like treasuries, which was something that was a vulnerability for that bank as well? And then sort of related to that, as we see interest rates rise, a lot of the commentary coming out of Barclays today in that conference had to do with net interest income, which, of course, is very closely linked to what is happening with interest rates.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So I mean, looking at where those two names perform today, I mean, this is just kind of one headline coming out of that. But regional banks are certainly going to be in focus moving forward as well. And of course, there's the regulation talk around that, too.JULIE HYMAN: Right, definitely.]"

The bank’s shareholders alleged that Wells Fargo and its past management misinformed them about how swiftly it was addressing governance issues and risk-management systems due to which it opened millions of fake accounts.Accordingly, when these shortcomings surfaced, the bank's market value fell by more than $54 billion over two years ending in March 2020. However, Wells Fargo denied any wrongdoing and decided to settle to eliminate further litigation expenses. It agreed to pay $1 billion in May 2023 to settle the claims.The settlement amount paid by Wells Fargo will be given to the investors who had bought the stock from Feb 2, 2018 through Mar 12, 2020.WFC has a long list of pending legal cases and remains under close supervision of the regulatory authorities. Last month, it agreed to pay a civil penalty of $35 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claimfor overcharging advisory fees of more than $26.8 million in over 10,900 investment advisory accounts.Further, in the first quarter of 2023, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $300 million, settling a class action suit claiming that the bank had pushed unnecessary insurance on auto loan customers. These affect operational efficiency of the bank as well as increases cost, thereby hindering its bottom-line growth.Wells Fargo’s shares have gained 7.6% over the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 2.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWFC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It has already reduced its employee base by nearly 40,000 and cuts are likely to continue, Santomassimo said.""I do think that there's more to do, and you'll see that through the headcount number,"" he added.Wells Fargo had 233,834 employees at the end of the June quarter compared to 243,674 in the second quarter last year.The bank has trimmed its mortgage business, which has also seen some layoffs.The industry is also seeing pressure in the commercial real estate business and particularly in office loans, which has emerged as a big worry for banks as financing costs rise for many buildings that have been largely vacated by employees who opt to work remotely.Even though there is systematic stress in office real estate, the other portfolios are performing well, Santomassimo said. There could be some ongoing pressure in the CRE portfolio but it is unlikely to be to the tune of what the bank had seen in the previous quarters.In the June quarter, Wells Fargo increased its allowances for credit losses by $949 million to account for potential losses in office loans.Wells Fargo is still operating under an asset cap that prevents it from growing until regulators deem that it has fixed problems from a fake accounts scandal. The company still has nine open consent orders from banking regulators who require additional oversight of its practices.Santomassimo did not provide any guidance on when the asset cap could be lifted but said the bank has been working to fix its internal issues.(Reporting by Nupur Anand in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci)]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pfizer PFE, BioNTech BNTX, Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:FDA Approves Pfizer, Moderna's New Covid VaccinesThe FDA approved Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s updated mRNA vaccines to protect against the currently circulating strains of the COVID-19 virus.Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines are each approved for individuals 12 years of age and older and are authorized under emergency use for individuals 6 months through 11 years of age.Pre-clinical/clinical data from studies on Moderna and Pfizer’s updated mRNA vaccines have shown improved neutralizing antibody responses against multiple circulating Omicron-related sub-lineages, including XBB.1.5, BA.2.86 (also called Pirola) and EG.5.1 (also called Eris).Moderna and Pfizer’s mRNA vaccines have been updated to include a single component that corresponds to the Omicron variant XBB.1.5, as directed by the FDA in June. In the said month, XBB.1.5, a subvariant of Omicron, was the dominant variant. Now, the dominant strains are Pirola and Eris. However, the companies are confident that their updated vaccines can provide protection against Pirola and Eris, which closely match the XBB.1.5 subvariant.Infection rates are once again climbing in the United States, with Pirola and Eris accounting for the majority of the cases.Moderna and Pfizer have been manufacturing the updated vaccines at risk and believe they will be ready for commercial delivery of the updated vaccines for the 2023-2024 fall and winter season.They expect the vaccines to be launched in pharmacies, hospitals and clinics across the United States once the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the jab. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet on Sep 12 to provide recommendations on who should receive an updated vaccine.Story continuesNovavax has also developed an updated protein-based non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to target XBB lineages. However, the FDA did not give a green signal to Novavax’s updated vaccine. Novavax’s stock was down almost 13% in response.Novavax issued a press release stating that it is ready to distribute its updated vaccine for the fall season once it receives FDA approval and CDC recommendation.Drugmakers are trying to promote the idea of people taking an updated COVID shot along with their annual flu vaccination. However, some experts feel the protection offered by these updated shots wanes over time and with a new variant superseding the older one. Sales of Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax suffered in 2022 and the first half of 2023 as demand for COVID vaccines declined. It remains to be seen if these new “boosters” provide some boost to their makers’ top lines.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s regulatory filings seeking approval for the updated vaccines are also under review in Europe, with a decision anticipated in the coming weeks.Pfizer and Moderna have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

The validation of the Type II variation by the EMA marks an important step toward potentially making XTANDI, an existing standard of care for advanced prostate cancer in the E.U., available to patients with earlier stages of the disease who are at risk of their cancer spreading.""Submission to the EMA was supported by data from the international Phase 3 EMBARK trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of XTANDI in patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR across three study arms: XTANDI plus leuprolide (n=355), placebo plus leuprolide (n=358), or XTANDI monotherapy (n=355).The EMBARK study met its primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS) for the XTANDI plus leuprolide arm, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the risk of metastasis or death over placebo plus leuprolide. Detailed results from the trial were presented as a plenary session during the 2023 American Urological Association Annual Meeting on April 29.Story continuesThe overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of each of the medicines. XTANDI, either in combination with leuprolide or as a monotherapy, has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR.The EMBARK data are being discussed with other regulatory authorities around the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to support additional license applications for XTANDI in this indication in 2023 and beyond.Astellas has already reflected the impact from this acceptance in its financial forecast of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2024.About EMBARK The Astellas- and Pfizer-led Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial enrolled 1,068 patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients who were considered to experience high-risk BCR had a prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 9 months; serum testosterone ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L); and screening PSA by the central laboratory ≥ 1 ng/mL if they had a radical prostatectomy (with or without radiotherapy) as primary treatment for prostate cancer, or at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir if they had radiotherapy only as primary treatment for prostate cancer. Patients in the EMBARK trial were randomized to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus leuprolide (n=355), enzalutamide 160 mg as a monotherapy (n=355), or placebo plus leuprolide (n=358). Leuprolide 22.5 mg was administered every 12 weeks.The primary endpoint of the trial was MFS for enzalutamide plus leuprolide versus placebo plus leuprolide. MFS is defined as the duration of time in months between randomization and the earliest objective evidence of radiographic progression by central imaging or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For more information on the EMBARK trial (NCT02319837), go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.XTANDI, either in combination with leuprolide or as a monotherapy, has not been approved by any regulatory agency for the treatment of patients with nmHSPC with high-risk BCR.About Non-Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with High-Risk Biochemical Recurrence  In non-metastatic hormone- (or castration-) sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC or nmCSPC), no evidence of the cancer spreading to distant parts of the body (metastases) is detectable with conventional radiological methods (CT/MRI), and the cancer still responds to medical or surgical treatment designed to lower testosterone levels.1,2 Of men who have undergone definitive prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or both, an estimated 20-40% will experience a BCR within 10 years.3 About 9 out of 10 men with high-risk BCR will develop metastatic disease, and 1 in 3 will die as a result of the recurrence.4 The EMBARK trial focused on men with high-risk BCR. Per the EMBARK protocol, patients with nmHSPC and high-risk BCR are those initially treated by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, or both, with a PSA-DT ≤ 9 months. High-risk BCR patients with a PSA-DT of ≤ 9 months have a higher risk of metastases and death.5About XTANDI® (enzalutamide) XTANDI® (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. XTANDI is a standard of care and has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC; also known as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or mCSPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). XTANDI is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 90 countries, including in the U.S., European Union, and Japan. Over one million patients have been treated with XTANDI globally.[6]About XTANDI™ (enzalutamide) in the E.U. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor indicated in the E.U. for the treatment of adult men with:Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC, also known as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or mCSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).High-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. It is also indicated in adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.Important Safety InformationFor important Safety Information for enzalutamide please see the full Summary of Product Characteristics at: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/xtandi-epar-product-information_en.pdf.Important Safety InformationFor Important Safety Information for enzalutamide please see the Package Insert.About AstellasAstellas Pharma Inc. is a pharmaceutical company conducting business in more than 70 countries around the world.

A third vaccine from Novavax remains under review.On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the shots for those aged 12 and above, and authorized them for emergency use in children aged 6 months through 11 years. Advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted on Tuesday to recommend the use of the vaccines widely. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said last month she expects the shots to be given annually, but not all doctors agree everyone needs them each year.How is this year's vaccine different from last year?Pfizer with BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax all have created new versions of their COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike last year's booster shot that included the original strain of the virus and the then-dominant Omicron variant, this year's shot targets only XBB.1.5, the predominant variant through most of 2023.The companies have said their retooled vaccines have been shown in early testing to work against newer Omicron subvariants now circulating, including the highly mutated BA.2.86.Should seniors, the immunocompromised and pregnant people get the shot this year?There is broad consensus among doctors that these groups should receive at least an annual COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus because of their elevated risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death. For instance, the British government's vaccine committee said only adults 65 and older and some of these other categories will be offered the shot as they are the most likely to benefit.Should younger, healthy adults get the new vaccine?Many doctors believe the vaccine should be recommended annually for everyone, much like influenza vaccines.Story continuesDr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases specialist and a liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said a simple and straight-forward recommendation is likely best.""If you're six months of age or older, you should get a flu vaccine. Sounds good to me for COVID also,"" Schaffner said.Dr. David Boulware, a University of Minnesota infectious diseases specialist, said he would recommend that healthy adults get the shots. According to research he has published, people who have received booster shots have symptoms that are less severe and shorter-lasting if they get sick.Dr. Paul Offit, a University of Pennsylvania infectious disease expert and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, said he believes the shots should be recommended annually only for high-risk groups. Studies have not shown the booster shots protect against disease in lower-risk populations, Offit said.Should people suffering with long COVID get the shot?There is some data that suggests that vaccination after infection may contribute to a reduction in long COVID symptoms. Regardless, doctors have said that a second episode of COVID-19 could rekindle prior long COVID or worsen ongoing symptoms, and vaccination could help protect against that.Should children receive a COVID-19 vaccine this year?Opinions vary on the need for the shots in children.University of Minnesota epidemiologist Michael Osterholm said children made up a larger percentage of deaths and hospitalizations among those currently with COVID. Although hospitalizations in general are fairly low, over the past month people ages 17 and under have accounted for around 5-6% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, compared with around 4% on average over the previous two years, according to CDC data.""If parents want to vaccinate their kids, they should be allowed to,"" Osterholm said.Boulware said he believes giving children boosters is unnecessary unless there is an immunocompromised person in the household.The American Academy of Pediatrics said it would make its recommendations after the CDC's advisory committee meets.(Reporting by Michael Erman, Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Maggie Fick in London; Editing by Caroline Humer and Will Dunham)]"

The panel approved the vaccines from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Novavax (NVAX) is still awaiting authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its booster. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani explains the story.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: The CDC has made the final call on COVID booster approvals. So what do we need to know?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So the advisory committee just voted a majority in favor of approving those vaccine boosters. That's the one that Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax have all been updating as a monovalent, so that just a single targeting those variants, XBB.1.5, in particular. Now what this means is that those doses should be available as soon as the CDC director signs off on this. And that will open the door to get those vaccinations done for fall.Now, just a point of note, we did-- we do know that, of course, both Pfizer and Moderna did already get the green light from the FDA. However, Novavax is still waiting on their authorization to go through, because they haven't yet-- there isn't actually a clear reason why they haven't been able to get that. So while we were waiting to get all three out the door, see all three get their authorization and that green light and basically open the doors, only two so far will be able to do that as soon as the CDC signs off.The way they did vote on it today though, is to allow once Novavax gets their approval to be able to join in on the market. We also got some interesting insight from the meeting today, which is the list prices of these vaccines. If you recall earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna gave a range of about 110 to 130. And if you see on your screen, they're falling on the middle upper range of that. Meanwhile, Novavax at 130 per dose. Again, that is a list price. Of course, we know the insured won't necessarily have to pay that. And of course, there are rebates and the like that go on with all these contracts. So just a little insight into that.But as of right now, we have potentially three new vaccines to be able to take this winter, again, once one of them gets greenlit. So that's the news for right now.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Just in time as we see those cases tick up for COVID. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that.]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the pharma industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Pharma ETFs.As of 2023, Deloitte has valued the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technology industries at $2.83 trillion. A report on the Global Pharmaceuticals Outlook by Atradius highlights China’s emergence as a key player in the global pharmaceutical industry. The number of households in the country with an annual income of $35,000 is expected to increase from 65 million in 2020 to 152 million by 2026. This is expected to provide impetus to the demand for high-value pharmaceuticals. In addition to this, China’s aging population is also expected to drive demand and benefit some of the best pharma stocks, such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). You can also check out the 10 Best Small Cap Pharma Stocks to Buy here.Meanwhile, the US pharmaceutical market is observing a dynamic change as the country disclosed a pricing shift under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Medicare would now have the ability to negotiate drug prices with the manufacturers and enforce inflationary rebates from pharmaceutical companies. According to the legislation, the US national insurer could potentially negotiate the prices for up to 10 drugs by 2026, and this number could increase to 60 by 2029. The IRA has given the power to the government to impose an excise duty of up to 95% on companies that do not engage in negotiations.Growth TrajectoryExperts believe that mergers and acquisitions could be a highlight for the pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) anticipates a series of deals falling within the $20 billion to $40 billion range in 2023, largely driven by the robust financial positions and liquidity of pharmaceutical companies. Experts in the field identify oncology and immunology as areas with substantial growth potential, which also emphasizes the investment opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry.Story continuesFor investors seeking exposure to the pharmaceutical sector, ETFs have proven to be a reliable option. Among these, the VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) has established a reputation as one of the top-performing ETFs over the past five years. Another ETF that has performed well in the past five years is the Vanguard Health Care Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VHT), also known as Vanguard Pharma ETF amongst retail investors. Notably, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) holds the distinction of being the largest pharma ETF, featuring many prominent pharmaceutical industry names.

The best pharma ETFs also provide exposure to industries like biotechnology, clinical trials, and immunotherapy. The ETFs have been ranked in ascending order of their 5-year performance.12. iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 14.7%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $373.82 millionExpense Ratio: 0.40%iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) is managed by New York-based BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), which is one of the biggest asset management companies globally. Overall, the ETF has 40 holdings. The ETF intends to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones US Select Pharmaceuticals Index as it plans to invest at least 80% of its assets in the securities of the underlying index.The three biggest holdings of the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) are Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS). Together, the three biggest holdings occupy 50.51% of the fund's portfolio.Here’s what Baron Funds said about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”11.

(NYSE:MRK), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are the three biggest constituents of the ETF, representing 21.72% of the portfolio. Overall, First Trust NASDAQ Pharmaceuticals ETF (NASDAQ:FTXH) has 45 holdings. Between 2017 and 2022, the ETF generated the highest annual return of 22.35% in 2019.10. Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR)5-Year Performance as of September 11, 2023: 25.1%Total Net Assets as of September 11, 2023: $40.12 millionExpense Ratio: 0.50%Global X Aging Population ETF (NASDAQ:LNGR) is based on the mandate that average human lives are getting longer with every passing day. According to the forecasts presented by the World Health Organization (WHO) in October 2021, there would be 2 billion people above the age of 60 by 2050. As the senior population rises, especially in the Western hemisphere, they would require creative solutions that cater to their preferences. These diverse solutions are expected to have a significant impact across various sectors and strongly benefit the pharmaceutical industry.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (4519.T), and Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) are the three biggest holdings of the ETF, representing 11.85% of the portfolio. Of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 25 funds held a stake in Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) as of Q2 2023.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC shared the following stance on Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC), the eye care devices, equipment and consumables provider, was also a leading contributor during the quarter. In addition to a backdrop of resilient and robust demand across all of its segments, Alcon’s focus on executing its commercial strategy, pricing improvements and product development demonstrates the strength of the business. As an innovative leader in the eye care industry, Alcon develops cutting‐edge products such as Total30, the first reusable lenses using water gradient technology created for astigmatic wearers, and the ARGOS Biometer, which enables surgeons to conduct 3D digital image‐ guided cataract surgery. Products such as these have allowed Alcon to further penetrate its primary end markets and win market share from competitors. While the company continues to navigate challenges such as inflation and supply‐chain inefficiencies, we believe Alcon’s prudent decisions that have helped maintain operational efficiency, its thoughtful approach to acquisitions, and the advantageous industry dynamics highlight the high‐quality nature of the company and the long‐term sustainability of its business model.”9.

(NYSE:ABBV), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are the four biggest member constituents of the ETF and take up 22.38% of the portfolio.Here's what Rowan Street Capital said about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our current portfolio is made up of just 10 companies — we are very focused! We described our ‘10-Player All-Star Team’ philosophy in our Q1 2018 Letter (we encourage you to review it). We have been building this portfolio since our founding in 2015. In total, over the past 8 years, we bought stock in 47 different companies (that’s ~6 per year), and obviously, for anyone who is good at arithmetic, we sold 37 of them (~4.6 per year). We are constantly trying to learn from every decision (good or bad) that we make. We went through every position that we’ve sold since 2015 and analyzed how we would have done had we held on to those positions. The top 3 performing positions would have been: Chipotle (CMG) +630%, Tractor Supply (TSCO) +315% and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) +387%. Your managers are at fault here because we sold all of these (in 2017-18) for non-fundamental reasons. All of these continued to be great businesses and management has executed at very high levels. In all three cases, we made a decision to sell because we thought the stock price got way ahead of itself.Our main take-away lesson has to be Do NOT sell your winners and avoid adding more to your losers. Or as Peter Lynch once famously put it: “Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.”We were fortunate to purchase CMG, TSCO and NVO at very attractive prices when these companies hit a temporary speed bump in their business. These were businesses that were simple to understand and we knew them very well as we had a chance to study them thoroughly for some time prior to our purchase. However, when you choose to sell you get the cash proceeds. First, you have to pay the capital gains tax and then you have to make another ‘buy decision’ or, in a lot of cases, a number of them. The more decisions you make, the higher probability that you will make mistakes. More often than not, you end up buying a business that you know less well and end up partnering with the management team, whose character, management and capital allocation abilities may still be somewhat moot to you. These things take time to get comfortable with!

186,9eac33dd-b28d-3e2c-820c-1bc2c8a839fe,PFE,2023-09-13,Americans can now get an updated COVID-19 vaccine,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cdc-panel-recommends-updated-covid-202626488.html,1694550386,STORY,['PFE'],"[Most Americans should get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said Tuesday.Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed the new shots for everyone 6 months and older and the agency's director quickly signed off Tuesday on the panel's recommendation. That means doses should be available this week, some as early as Wednesday.The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has faded, but there are still thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths in the U.S. each week. Hospitalizations have been increasing since late summer, though the latest data indicate infections may be starting to level off, particularly in the South.Still, experts worry that immunity from previous vaccinations and infections is fading in many people, and a new shot would save many lives.According to a survey last month that CDC cited, about 42% said they would definitely or probably get the new vaccine. Yet only about 20% of adults got an updated booster when it was offered a year ago.Doctors hope enough people get vaccinated to help avert another “tripledemic” like last year when hospitals were overwhelmed with an early flu season, an onslaught of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and yet another winter coronavirus surge.Here is what you need to know about the new COVID-19 shots:WHO SHOULD GET THE UPDA TED VACCINE?The Food and Drug Administration approved the updated shot s from Pfizer and Moderna for adults and children as young as age 6 months. FDA said starting at age 5, most people can get a single dose even if they’ve never had a prior COVID-19 shot. Younger children might need additional doses depending on their history of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations.The CDC decides how best to use vaccines and makes recommendations for U.S. doctors and the general public. The agency's panel of outside experts recommended the updated COVID-19 shots by a vote of 13-1. The no vote came from a panel member who had argued that the new shots should initially be recommended only for older people and others at greatest risk of severe illness. But other panel members said all ages could — and should — benefit.Story continues“We need to make vaccination recommendations as clear as possible,” said one panel member, Dr. Camille Kotton, an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital.WHERE CAN I GET A SHOT?The new vaccine will be available at pharmacies, health centers and some doctor offices. Locations will be listed on the government's vaccines.gov website. The list price of a dose of each shot is $120 to $130, according to the manufacturers. But federal officials said the new COVID-19 shots still will be free to most Americans through private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. For the uninsured or underinsured, the CDC is working with health departments, clinics and certain pharmacies to temporarily provide free shots.On Tuesday, a Pfizer official said his company expected to have doses available at some U.S. locations as early as Wednesday.WHY MORE COVID-19 SHOTS?Similar to how flu shots are updated each year, the FDA gave COVID-19 vaccine makers a new recipe for this fall. The updated shots have a single target, an omicron descendant named XBB.1.5. It’s a big change. The COVID-19 vaccines offered since last year are combination shots targeting the original coronavirus strain and a much earlier omicron version, making them very outdated.Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax all have brewed new supplies, and the FDA on Monday approved shots from Pfizer and Moderna. Novavax's updated vaccine is still under review.WILL THEY BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH?Health officials are optimistic, barring a new mutant. As expected, XBB.1.5 has faded away in the months it took to tweak the vaccine. Today, there is a soup of different coronavirus variants causing illness and the most common ones are fairly close relatives. Recent lab testing from vaccine makers and other research groups suggest the updated shots will offer crossover protection.Earlier vaccinations or infections have continued to help prevent severe disease and death but protection wanes over time, especially against milder infections as the virus continually evolves. The FDA did allow seniors and others at high risk to get an extra booster dose last spring. But most Americans haven’t had a vaccination in about a year.CAN I GET A FLU SHOT AND COVID-19 SHOT AT THE SAME TIME?Yes. The CDC says there is no difference in effectiveness or side effects if people get those vaccines simultaneously, although one in each arm might be more comfortable. The CDC urges a yearly flu shot for pretty much everyone ages 6 months and up. The best time is by the end of October.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

They’re expected to hit clinics later this week,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-ages-6-months-older-195419052.html,1694548459,STORY,['PFE'],"[All Americans ages 6 months and older are eligible to receive an updated COVID booster tailored to a newer Omicron strain, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced late Tuesday.The agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13-1 Tuesday to approve updated jabs from Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax for the vast majority of U.S. residents. Shortly thereafter, the federal health agency announced that it had accepted the committee's recommendation, and that vaccines would be available later in the week.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve Novavax's updated formula. But the agency authorized such boosters from Moderna and Pfizer on Monday.The CDC anticipates having adequate booster supply and shouldn't need to prioritize certain groups—like the elderly or immunocompromised—for first doses, federal health officials said at the Tuesday committee meeting.""Vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death,"" the CDC said in a late Tuesday news release announcing its decision. ""Vaccination also reduces your chance of suffering the effects of Long COVID. If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccination in the past two months, get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect yourself this fall and winter.""With the end of the federal health emergency, the U.S. government is no longer providing free COVID vaccines to everyone. Still, most Americans should be able to get a new booster for free, the agency said. Most insurance plans will cover the booster at no cost, including Medicare and Medicaid. Those who are uninsured or underinsured can get a free vaccine at local health centers or state, local, tribal, or territorial health departments. Pharmacies participating in the CDC's Bridge Access Program will also provide free vaccines. And children eligible for the Vaccines for Children program—about 50% of kids in the U.S.—can receive a free vaccine from a participating provider.Story continuesWithout insurance of other financial assistance, Moderna's new jab will cost $129, Pfizer's $120, and Novavax's $130 per dose, company representatives said at Tuesday's committee hearing.All eligible should get the new booster when possible, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told Fortune on Tuesday.""It is clear that the vaccine remains safe and effective at all ages,"" he said. ""People at high risk will especially benefit from the vaccine.""In a statement provided to Fortune, the American Medical Association on Tuesday said it welcomed the committee's recommendations, contending that the updated jabs would prevent about 400,000 hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths over the next couple of years.""We continue to strongly urge everyone to stay up to date on their COVID-19, influenza, and RSV vaccines to protect themselves and their loved ones from severe complications, hospitalization, and death,"" the organization said, adding that it expected an increase in infections this fall and winter.New boosters are dated but should still helpLast year's updated Omicron boosters, released around Labor Day, were bivalent, tailored to both Omicron and the initial strain of COVID. This year's boosters are monovalent, meaning they're tailored to just one strain of the virus: XBB.1.5 ""Kraken,"" which dominated in the U.S. and elsewhere late last year into early this year.The strain is now nearly extinct. XBB.1.5 was estimated to be responsible for just 3.1% of U.S. infections 10 days ago, according to the latest variant data the CDC has made available.While the newest jabs are tailored to a dying strain of Omicron, they're still expected to protect against severe disease and death from currently circulating strains, the vast majority of which are members of the XBB viral family.While the official names of COVID strains can be quite confusing, high-flying variant EG.5, nicknamed ""Eris,"" is also an XBB-family variant, meaning updated boosters should provide good defense against it. As of 10 days ago, the variant was projected to be the most common COVID strain in the U.S., responsible for more than a fifth of cases.The formula for the new vaccines ""is highly similar to the EG.5-related variants circulating now,"" Dr. Stuart Ray, vice chair of medicine for data integrity and analytics at Johns Hopkins’ Department of Medicine, told Fortune on Tuesday.Recently released preliminary data shows that refreshed boosters should also offer decent protection against new, highly mutated Omicron spawn ""Pirola"" BA.2.86. It's not a member of the XBB family, and is instead thought to have evolved from so-called ""stealth Omicron"" BA.2.The updated vaccine's protection against Pirola won't be as good as the protection it offers against EG.5 and other XBB variants, Ray said. Still, there is more to immunity than antibodies, produced by B cells in response to infection and vaccination. The other, oft-forgotten half of the immune system, T cells, provides protection against severe disease. While T cells can't prevent infection like B cells can, they still help soften the blow—of a BA.2.86 infection, EG.5 infection, or otherwise.An unofficial vaccine priority listWhile there will be no triaging of patients for new COVID boosters, the most vulnerable—including the elderly, those with weak immune systems, and young children who haven't yet received a COVID vaccine—should be sure to schedule their shot ASAP, Dr. Ali Alhassani tells Fortune. He's head of clinical services at Summer Health, a subscription-based pediatrics service accessible via text message in all 50 states, as well as an attending physician at Boston Children's Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School.Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of the division of infectious disease at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine, agreed with Alhassani, telling Fortune that those who are pregnant, as well as those with underlying disease, should also ""prioritize this vaccine"" along with the flu vaccine, which can be given at the same time.While COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are lower than they have been in prior years, they've increased by 10% to 20% in recent weeks—good reason to schedule your fall shots, he added.Dr. John Schumann—a Tulsa, Okla.-based primary care doctor and internal medicine specialist with Oak Street Health, a chain of primary care clinics that serve older adults—hopes everyone gets the new jab.But ""at the very least, seniors over the age of 65 and immunocompromised individuals should,"" he told Fortune. ""As COVID variants continue to evolve, seniors are still at high risk for hospitalization or even death from COVID or complicating factors,"" he said.Dr. Carlos del Rio, president of the Infectious Disease Society of America, agreed with Schumann, saying in a statement that ""the most important people to receive this new vaccine"" are those at high risk, including the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.Those who didn't receive last year's Omicron booster should also make getting this year's Omicron booster a priority, Schumann added.""With cold weather coming, we expect more indoor gatherings to lead to a further uptick in cases this winter,"" he said. ""Getting boosted in October or November is a good way to either prevent yourself from catching the virus, or to reduce the severity of it if you do catch it.""A (temporary) anecdote for waning immunityPopulation immunity to COVID—from infection, vaccination, or both—wanes in roughly three to six months. If the CDC's goal is to maintain ""robust hybrid immunity"" among U.S. residents, the agency should approve boosters for everyone and ""strongly encourage uptake,"" Ryan Gregory told Fortune on Tuesday, ahead of the agency's decision. Gregory is a biology professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, who is leading the charge in assigning nicknames like ""Kraken"" and ""Eris"" to high-flying variants, for ease of communication.The agency's decision to offer the vaccine to virtually all Americans was the initial step Gregory was hoping for. But the vaccine alone isn't enough, he said. That's because it ""may not stop reinfections"" and is only expected to prevent severe outcomes like hospitalization and death, Raj Rajnarayanan—assistant dean of research and associate professor at the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Ark., and a top COVID-variant tracker—told Fortune.Because COVID vaccines aren't entirely preventative, mitigation tools like masks, respirators, proper ventilation, air filtration, and social distancing are still necessary, Gregory said. A bonus: They work against all variants.Rajnarayanan hopes that federal health officials will instruct vaccine manufacturers to continually submit data on how their latest formulations are holding up against the latest COVID variants—and ""leave room for updating the vaccine, even as a bivalent formulation.""Boosters should no longer target one particular variant, but problematic mutations appearing in many COVID variants in tandem, like the so-called ""flip mutations"" expected to rear their ugly heads this fall, Rajnarayanan and Gregory maintain.If troublesome mutations arise after a new booster is released, drug-makers should focus on the fast development of tailored monoclonal antibodies—lab-made treatments given to high-risk patients via infusion that can block the virus from entering cells, thus curbing infection—according to Rajnarayanan.Currently, monoclonals are needed for BA.2.86 and variants with ""flip"" mutations. If these are developed, society will have the tools it needs to combat the virus—the new booster, the antiviral Paxlovid, and adequate IV treatments—and should be set, he said.For now, anyway.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Oregon holds shares in the company worth approximately $5.2 million.The complaint, which does not specify what damages it seeks, alleges Fox's board decided to broadcast former President Donald Trump's election falsehoods in order to satisfy his supporters, while knowing that doing so would expose the company to lawsuits.“Defendants chose to invite robust defamation claims, with potentially huge financial liability and potentially larger business repercussions, rather than disappoint viewers of Fox News,” the lawsuit said.In April, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.Dominion had argued that the news outlet damaged its reputation by airing phony conspiracy theories that its equipment switched votes from Trump to Democrat Joe Biden.Lachlan Murdoch, chair and CEO of Fox Corp., said when the settlement was announced that it avoided “the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”Story continuesAnother voting machine company, Smartmatic USA, also sued Fox News over its coverage of election conspiracy theories.In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said the Fox breached its fiduciary duties by disregarding legal risks.“The directors’ choices exposed themselves and the company to liability and exposed their shareholders to significant risks,"" she said. “That is the crux of our lawsuit, and we look forward to making our case in court.”]"

Even if the SEC has vowed to appeal the ruling.So to no one’s surprise, traditional financial (TradFi) institutions suddenly want a piece of the cryptocurrency pie again. Enter PayPal announcing the launch of PYUSD, a proprietary stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar in early August.The problem? What was intended to be a milestone in TradFi adoption has landed with a thud amongst crypto natives, and it's not due to some personal vendetta.Guy Vider is the co-founder and chief technology officer of Kima.On a line-by-line basis in the smart contract’s code, PYUSD presents a litany of problems and vulnerabilities that clash directly with crypto’s decentralized framework. Without addressing these issues now, PayPal opens up Pandora’s box for other institutions to feel as though the rules of crypto don’t apply to them, giving them a license to remake the industry in their image and bulldoze over a well-established community.PayPal’s centralized code conundrumBefore diving into PYUSD’s actual code, it’s worth mentioning the token’s purpose: to be purchased only from PayPal, and (currently) sold back only to PayPal. If that sounds familiar, it’s essentially a revamped crypto version of a walled garden or a closed loop of financial activity.That doesn’t sound too awful, but given PayPal’s history of censorship, unilateral account closures, asset seizures and general lack of transparency, you would be right to question a crypto token controlled by an entity that can swipe your funds for the slightest of reasons.One caveat to also note is that these opinions are based on the initial PYUSD contract unveiled in early August, and that contract’s code can be changed at any time. For all we know, it is nothing more than a beta.But immediately when examining PYUSD’s code certain vulnerabilities emerge. Some of these issues are inherent to smart contracts, like freezing and even potentially wiping out account balances if it's exploited. That would undoubtedly undermine trust in the stablecoin and deter adoption.Story continuesSpeaking of security, we can’t ignore the stablecoin’s blacklist function. To be clear, other leading stablecoins, such as Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT, use a built-in blacklisting mechanism to combat hackers and criminals from accessing them. Using a blacklist is practically an industry standard.Implementing a blacklist, however, requires either a government order or proof of a hack to lock funds — and they can be unlocked at any time should circumstances change.PYUSD’s code has a function called “wipeFrozenAddress” that “Wipes the balance of a frozen address, and burns the tokens.” This means the tokens are taken from the user and wiped from the total supply of tokens with no recourse, akin to throwing dollar bills into an incinerator.PYUSD also has a built-in “pause” functionality, suggesting that PayPal can stop transfers or trades of its tokens universally at any time, potentially causing a massive loss of value. Imagine if the U.S. government could push a button and make all the physical dollar bills in your wallet unusable until further notice, and you only found out when you tried to buy a cup of coffee.With PYUSD, the discretion of confiscating funds from users remains solely in the hands of a company that has shown time and again it cannot be trusted with such power.See also: Crypto Means Absolutely Nothing Without Censorship Resistance | Opinion (2022)Additionally, the code’s “assetProtection” feature threatens crypto’s decentralized perspective, echoing the faults within TradFi that instigated the birth of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) to begin with.This “centralization attack vector"" only further serves to position PYUSD more as a digital version of traditional fiat currency rather than the intended decentralized stablecoin it wants to be.What does that mean for everyone else?Code flaws aside, a major financial player like PayPal entering the stablecoin arena does signify a notable shift in the stance of TradFi towards crypto.Considering PayPal’s influence, it would be unsurprising if other major payment processors, who have already begun dipping their toes in crypto’s waters, take this as a cue to drastically up their pursuit of similar ventures. But they would be ill-advised to simply copy and paste PayPal’s proposition at face value.In the short term, cryptocurrency exchanges and other projects will likely try to ride PayPal’s outsized reach and user base by listing or adding support for PYUSD. Crypto companies will probably experiment with its capabilities and borrow the sheer name recognition that PayPal brings to divert attention to their own products.In the long term, however, it is likely that those concerned with preserving decentralization may hesitate to fully embrace PYUSD over more established, regulated, or non-regulated stablecoins due to PayPal’s punitive history and lack of liquidity.But even if PYUSD is a misfire, the overall changing TradFi sentiments in the wake of PayPal’s stablecoin move signal an increasingly positive future for DeFi and crypto in general.See also: Reject CBDCs, Embrace the Right to Transact | OpinionLooking into the features encoded within PayPal’s smart contract spotlights its insistent over-reaching centralized control of users’ finances. Features such as its sole determinations of “misinformation” and subsequent sole discretion to impose financial penalties are equally if not more worrisome.Likewise, its ability to transfer all funds from user wallets into PayPal leaves many crypto natives hesitant to adopt, viewing it as antithetical to the principles of cryptocurrency, potentially causing hesitation among potential adopters.Ultimately, PayPal’s foray into the stablecoin market showcases the wrong way to merge paths between TradFi and the crypto sector. If PYUSD is to gain true and lasting traction, PayPal needs to address centralization concerns and ensure its resilience against current and future vulnerabilities.]"

Last year was a disappointing one as the Fed pursued aggressive monetary control with a massive hike in the benchmark lending rate to combat 40-year high inflation. However, this space has witnessed rangebound trading in the past month.A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies. At present, the interest rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%, its highest in more than 22 years. Market participants were worried following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement last month at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium that the central bank is open to more rate hikes depending on economic data.However, on Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain rom a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are al all needed this year.The inflation rate has declined steadily since June 2022. Although currently it is well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy at a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.As a result, prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) are likely to regain momentum in fourth-quarter 2023.Stocks in FocusNVIDIA Corp.

This move is in sync with TAP’s plans to establish itself as a total beverage company.The company collaborated with the nonalcoholic energy drink brand for the first time in 2019. ZOA is available at more than 42,000 stores and more than 160,000 points of distribution across the United States and Canada.  With this expansion, ZOA will increase media and marketing investment to drive sales and expand distribution to international markets. Per the deal, Molson Coors will continue to be ZOA’s exclusive distribution partner.ZOA boasts 138% year-over-year growth, with more than $100 million in sales in 2022. According to Bizjournals, Molson Coors intends to double its media investment in ZOA in 2024.TAP is on track to grow market share through innovation and premiumization. In a bid to accelerate portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio for the past few years.Prior to this, Molson Coors acquired an award-winning whiskey brand, Blue Run Spirits. With the addition of Blue Run, the company is likely to expand its portfolio beyond beer and aid its premiumization strategy.What Else Should You Know?This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. It intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, and expand in adjacencies and beyond beer without hampering the support for its existing large brands. Some other notable efforts are creating digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.Strength in its core brands, particularly Coors Light and Miller Lite, acts as a key growth driver. The company intends to increase investment in convenience store shopper marketing in the second half of this year. Also, favorable volume leverage is expected to partly offset cost increases. This, along with premiumization and lower contract brewing volumes, is anticipated to drive gross margin expansion for the year.Driven by these factors, 2023 sales are projected to grow year over year in the high-single digits on a constant-currency basis, up from the prior mentioned low-single-digit growth. This will be backed by sturdy demand in the United States, with growth in rates and volumes. Underlying EBT is likely to grow 23-26% year over year compared with the earlier stated low-single-digit growth on a constant-currency basis.Shares of this company have gained 28.4% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 0.4%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry due to pricing actions stemming from inflationary pressures. Also, cost inflation, with respect to materials and manufacturing expenses and unfavorable mix, is concerning. Management anticipates the inflation impacts on the cost of goods sold for 2023.

Fain, who briefed local unions on the talks on Tuesday, is set to announce the union's strike plan on Wednesday evening. The Detroit Free Press reported the plan earlier.Targeting strategic plants could quickly force automakers to halt U.S. production and could extend the time before the UAW's $825 million strike fund is exhausted.Coordinated strikes would mark the first-ever simultaneous labor stoppage at all three Detroit automakers and one of the largest U.S. industrial labor actions in recent years.Automakers are facing pressure from some lawmakers to offer more generous contracts.

The walkout by some 12,700 workers will halt production of some popular models.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

Let’s take a look at Target and Dollar Tree’s outlook to gauge a rebound.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSustaining Growth As retail giants, Target and Dollar Tree are vying to sustain their growth amid a more challenging operating environment.Lower margins are affecting both companies with fears surrounding sales mix and high theft at the center of attention.Dollar Tree’s low-priced consumer products already call for lower margins on top of the impact of shrink although the trend in consumer shopping has still focused on savings which has weighed down Target’s margins as a higher-quality retailer.Although EPS estimates have trended down over the last 30 days in correlation with lowered guidance, Target’s bottom line is still expected to expand 26% in its current fiscal 2024 with earnings projected to jump another 18% in FY25 at $9.01 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Dollar Tree, earnings are now expected to decline -17% in its FY24 but stabilize and rebound 18% in FY25 at $7.07 per share. However, Dollar Tree’s FY23 and FY24 EPS estimates are slightly down over the last month as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndervalued CaseDeclining earnings estimates are concerning but Target and Dollar Tree’s low P/E valuations bid well for more upside in their stocks from current levels.Trading around $122 a share, Target’s stock trades at a 16.1X forward earnings multiple. This is nicely beneath its Zacks Retail-Discount Stores industry average of 22.6X and the S&amp;P 500’s 26.2X. Furthermore, Target’s stock trades at a 47% discount to its decade-long high of 30.4X and slightly beneath the median of 16.3X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAt $114 and 19.4X forward earnings, Dollar Tree’s stock also trades nicely beneath the Retail-Discount Stores industry average and the benchmark. Notably, Dollar Tree’s stock trades 41% below its own decade-long high of 32.5X and on par with the median of 19.7X.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayGiven that earnings estimates don’t keep skidding from here, Target and Dollar Tree’s stock may certainly have more upside as they appear to be undervalued relative to their industry and the broader market. This lands both Target and Dollar Tree stock a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as a rebound is starting to look plausible from their current levels.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

219,9825e7bd-1dcc-3719-bbde-63fe00599359,BXP,2023-09-13,Is it Wise to Retain Boston Properties (BXP) Stock for Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wise-retain-boston-properties-bxp-140900207.html,1694527740,STORY,['BXP'],"[Given the growing demand for premier office spaces, Boston Properties’ BXP portfolio of modern, class A office buildings concentrated in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry geographic markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC, poises it well to ride the growth curve.Notably, in the second quarter of 2023, the company executed 938,000 square feet of leases with a weighted average lease term of eight years. In the first quarter of 2023, it executed 660,000 square feet of leases with a weighted average lease term of 7.7 years.This is a testament to the fact that new and existing clients continue to commit to the long-term use of space and prefer a premier workplace environment. Therefore, with an encouraging leasing pipeline and modest lease expirations through 2023, BXP is well-placed to navigate the challenging environment.This office real estate investment trust (REIT) enjoys a diversified, creditworthy tenant base, which includes several bellwethers. The long-term leases with these tenants assure stable revenue generation for the company, driving steady top-line growth. For 2023, we estimate a year-over-year increase of 4.2% in the company’s revenues from leases.The life-science industry is booming on the back of the increasing need for drug research and innovation. Against this backdrop, Boston Properties is converting numerous straight office buildings to laboratory/life science spaces in its suburban portfolio, especially its Kendall Center project, which is one of the leading preferred locations for life-science clients in the world. Given the robust demand for life-science assets, BXP is expected to witness healthy leasing activity in the life-science portfolio, driving the segment’s growth.Further, Boston Properties’ encouraging development and redevelopment pipeline is likely to fuel net operating income growth in the coming years. Its solid balance sheet position, with $3.1 billion of liquidity as of Jun 30, 2023, is likely to continue supporting its efforts to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.In addition, BXP’s current cash flow growth is projected at 30.59% compared with 8.77% estimated for the industry. Its trailing 12-month return on equity is 7.98% compared with the industry’s average of 2.97%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been raised marginally over the past week to $7.26.Shares of BXP have gained 14.9% in the quarter-to-date period against the industry’s fall of 2.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, a choppy office market environment amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to soften the demand for office properties in the near term, raising concerns for this office REIT. Management expects the slowdown in leasing activity to continue for the remainder of 2023. It anticipates most of its leasing to come from small and medium-sized professional and financial services firms in the upcoming period.Competition from industry peers may limit the company’s ability to retain tenants at relatively higher rents, denting its pricing power. Also, the elevated supply of office properties amid a competitive landscape may adversely impact BXP’s ability to backfill near-term tenant move-outs, hurting occupancy. We project the company to maintain an occupancy rate of 88.4% in 2023.Given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Boston Properties may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. Our estimate suggests a year-over-year rise of 17.4% in interest expense in the current year.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD. While COLD sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), WELL and SBAC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s 2023 FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past week to $3.54.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SBA Communications’ current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $12.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Americold Realty Trust’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 3.3% over the past month to $1.26.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SHOO is well-poised to tap the positive trends in the fashion world, thanks to its digital endeavors and other robust strategies. The company remains committed to boosting its e-commerce wing via prudent investments in digital marketing and efforts to optimize its website's features and functionality.In a nutshell, management is focused on creating a trend-right merchandise assortment, deepening relations with customers via marketing, enhancing the digital commerce agenda, expanding international markets and efficiently controlling expenses. Buoyed by such strengths, shares of this footwear dealer have gained 15.6% against the industry’s 6.6% decline over the past year.Delving DeeperWith respect to the e-commerce efforts, management has added high-level talent to the organization, ramped up digital marketing spending, improved data science capabilities, launched a try-before-you-buy payment facility, rolled out buy online, pick-up in store across its entire U.S. full-price retail outlets, and introduced advanced delivery and return options. The company has also been significantly accelerating its digital commerce initiatives concerning distribution.Steven Madden is focused on driving growth across the direct-to-consumer business, led by digital capabilities; expanding categories apart from footwear, such as handbags and apparel; enhancing its presence in the international markets and reinforcing its core U.S. wholesale footwear business. Gains from increased investment in digital marketing and robust consumer reception capabilities such as try before you buy have been strengths.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrudent acquisitions have been aiding Steven Madden’s performance. The company’s BB Dakota buyout, which is a California-based women's apparel company, appears encouraging. With this acquisition, the company can expand its apparel category. Additionally, management had concluded the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% share of its European joint venture. This transaction distributes the company’s branded footwear and accessories across the majority of countries in Europe.However, the company has posted soft second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Revenues and earnings also declined year over year. In the reported quarter, the company witnessed a challenging operating environment, conservative order patterns from wholesale customers and tough year-over-year comparisons.Nevertheless, Steven Madden has reduced its inventory levels and saw a solid gross margin performance despite the promotional retail backdrop. During the second quarter, gross margin expanded 190 basis points (bps) to 42.6%. As a percentage of wholesale revenues, gross profit increased 200 bps to 33.6%, driven by higher margins in the Wholesale accessories/apparel business.  The company has also been managing expenses.A proven business model, robust brands and various growth opportunities position the company well to drive overall growth and boost stakeholders’ value in the long run. On its earnings call, management said the company is poised to witness significant improvement in its financial performance starting in the third quarter.Considering its strengths, Steven Madden seems to be a decent investment bet. A VGM Score of A further speaks volumes for this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

The study surveyed CFOs and treasurers of growth corporates, organizations that have unique needs and capabilities but often fall through the cracks between small businesses and enterprises with their purpose-built solutions.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230913696739/en/Visa Releases First Growth Corporates Working Capital Index for the Middle-Market (Graphic: Business Wire)The findings revealed these organizations face challenges securing working capital solutions that fit the unique operational and financial needs of their business. Nearly half of surveyed growth corporates plan to use more working capital in the year ahead for strategic growth initiatives, yet 18% currently sub-optimize use of working capital, either due to a lack of access or a misalignment of the working capital solutions to their sector-specific requirements.The Working Capital Index highlights that nearly a third (32%) of surveyed growth corporates used external working capital solutions for strategic growth purposes to fund business expansion, buy inventory, upgrade legacy systems, and other growth initiatives. In fact, top performers used external working capital for strategic purposes 34% more than bottom performers this past year. These top performing growth corporates demonstrated efficiencies in improved Days Payable Outstanding (DPO), while also improving the financial stability of suppliers receiving the payments and the downstream financial ecosystem they touch.""Visa is pleased to introduce the 2023-2024 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index, which takes a closer look at the middle-market business community and how they are approaching working capital challenges,"" stated Darren Parslow, global head, Visa Commercial Solutions. ""This report provides practical insights into how CFOs and treasurers balance the day-to-day requirements of their businesses with the cash flow requirements needed to survive, thrive and scale. Of note, it reveals how top performing growth corporates are leading the way, embracing a broader range of external working capital solutions in order to fulfill strategic objectives.""Story continuesAdditional findings in the WCI include:On a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the perfect ratio of operational efficiency with the use of working capital solutions, the average score for respondents was 49, indicative of the broader misalignment of sector needs with available working capital options and access to them. Top performers achieved an average WCI score of 70, three times that of bottom performers saving, on average, $3.3M annually in interest and late fees, internal processing costs, and supplier discounts for early payment.Twice as many CFOs and treasurers used working capital solutions to fund strategic growth than used to fill unplanned cash flow gaps in the last 12 months.The 8% of respondents who wanted to use working capital solutions but were denied access were primarily concentrated in the CEMEA and APAC regions, and attributed approval-related barriers, including eligibility criteria and lengthy application processes as the reasons for their non-use.Surveyed growth corporates are shrugging off predictions of a global recession and expect easing credit conditions and improving business conditions in 2024. As such, 92% of growth corporate CFOs plan to use working capital solutions in the next 12 months, representing a 30% increase in working capital solution utilization.More than two-thirds of growth corporates respondents view virtual cards as a versatile working capital option and their use is expected to triple in 2024.""Visa is focused on and investing in uplifting growth corporates – middle market businesses today that hold tremendous potential to become tomorrow’s enterprise giants,"" noted Alan Koenigsberg, SVP, global head of large/middle market, treasury and industry verticals, Visa Commercial Solutions. ""Visa’s goal with the 2023-2024 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index was to gain a better understanding of the impact of working capital solutions on the operational efficiency of these businesses. This report is an important benchmark for measuring the health of this vibrant business sector and the ability to align working capital solutions with the needs and expectations of the CFOs and treasurers who rely on them to grow their businesses.""For more information about the WCI, please visit: https://visa-business-solutions.foleon.com/vbs/knowledge-hub/report-working-capital-indexAbout Visa Inc.Visa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

235,49630758-5a67-3000-923f-8a3767a38756,V,2023-09-13,Splunk and Shoe Carnival have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/splunk-shoe-carnival-highlighted-zacks-090000690.html,1694595600,STORY,"['SCVL', 'SPLK', 'MA', 'V']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 13, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Splunk SPLK as the Bull of the Day and Shoe Carnival SCVL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V and Mastercard Inc. MA.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:Splunk is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops and markets cloud services and licensed software solutions. The company enables enterprises to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data.The stock was a favorite back in 2020, but plummeted over 70% into the 2022 lows. But recently, investors have come back into the stock, helping SPLK almost double off those lows set back in October.The most recent catalyst was an earnings report that helped the stock jump 25% in just a couple weeks. So the question for investors now is if this strong momentum can continue and if Splunk can ever get back to those lofty 2020 highs.More About SplunkThe company incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It employs 8,000 and has a market cap of $20 billion.The company’s offerings enable users to investigate, monitor, analyze and act on machine data and big data, irrespective of format or source, and helps in operational decision making.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “B” in Growth and Momentum. However, the stock scores an “F” in Value. The Forward PE is 33 and the stock pays no dividend.Q4 EarningsSplunk reported Q2 earnings in late August seeing an 84% EPS beat. The company also raised its full year outlook on the top and bottom line.Splunk guided Q3 revenue at $1.02-1.04B vs the $986M expected and guided FY24 revenues at $3.93-3.95B vs the $3.90B expected.Cloud revenue was up 29% y/y and operating margin was 16.7%, up from 3.6% last year.Their customer base is getting larger as well, with customer with ARR over $1M at 834, which is up 111 year over year.Story continuesEstimates SurgeWith the strong guidance, analysts were quick to hike estimates and lift price targets.For the current quarter, we see numbers go from $0.77 to $1.11, a jump of 44%.Next quarter has been flat, but looking at the current year and next year, we see analyst lifting numbers over the last 30 days.For the current year, we see estimates have ticked 20% higher going from $3.13 to $3.76. For next year we see a hike of 17%, with analysts lifting numbers from $3.60 to $4.22.Almost every analyst on the street lifted their price targets the day following earrings. Here are a few firms lifting targets:Wedbush- Reiterated SPLK with a Neutral, price target: $105 from $86 JPMorgan Chase- Reiterated SPLK with Neutral, price target: $120 from $100 RBC- Reiterated SPLK with Outperform, price target: $132 from $125  The Technical TakeSplunk was a post-covid favorite in 2020, hitting highs of $225. But it sold off over the last three years, with the stock falling to $65 before rallying to $125 recently.The stock is well off its lows, but investors should lower their expectations before thinking $200 is coming soon. It will take a while to repair all that damage and there will be resistance levels up above. Look for $140 and $175 to be issues to the upside.For those looking for an entry, below are some levels to watch:21-day Moving Average (MA): $11250-day MA: 108200-day MA: $97.50Fibonacci support (50%): $110 Fibonacci support (61.8%): $107The $107-110 area would be the buy zone with a lean against the 200-day MA.In SummaryWhile it is hard to chase a stock that is up 25% in the last month and almost 100% on the year, Splunk is certainly one to watch. On the fundamental side, the company is back on track when it comes to earnings and growth. On the technical side, there are buyable pullback setups that investors should be watching for.Bulls should be looking to accumulate shares at support levels and watch estimates for any big changes in expectations.Bear of the Day:Shoe Carnival is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that operates as a family footwear retailer in the United States.  The company offers a broad assortment of moderately priced dress, casual and athletic footwear for men, women, and children with emphasis on national and regional name brands.The stock has struggled all year, trading lower by about 13%. Investors must ask themselves why the stock is down when the overall market is up.The answer seems to be earnings, with the company missing two of the last three quarters.About the CompanyShoe Carnival is headquartered in Evansville, IN.The company was founded in 1978 and employs 2,500 people. It operates 404 stores in 33 states and Puerto Rico, and offers online shopping at its website.SCVL is valued at $600 million and has a Forward PE of 7. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but “F” in Growth. The stock pays a dividend of about 2%.Q4 EarningsShoe Carnival reported earnings in late August, missing expectations by 12%. Revenues were down year over year and they cut their outlook.For FY23, the company now sees $3.10-3.25 v the 3.60 expected. Same Store Sales are now expected at -8% to -6% v the -2% to +2% expected. The company cut new store expectations to 6-10 v the prior 10-20.Gross margin was an issue too, down 40bps year over year.In their back to school update the company said that “Market conditions continued to modestly improve in early third quarter 2023 versus second quarter 2023.” Management added that August sales and profits were close to record highs and margins were near records.While the back-to-school season seems to be doing well, estimates are coming down.EstimatesSince earnings analysts have lowered estimates.Over the last 30 days, numbers for the current quarter were cut from $1.28 to $1.02, or 25%.For the current year, analysts lowered estimates from $3.60 to $3.17, or 12%.Technical TakeWhen you zoom out on the SCVL chart something becomes very clear. The $20 level is very important.From 2018 to 2021 this was the resistance. The stock broke out in early 2021 and has come back to the $20 level where it has been supported.If this level breaks, the stock could see another leg lower to the $15 area.Looking at resistance, all the moving averages are above the current rpice. The 21-day is sloping lower and is currently under $23.The $24 level is where both the 50-day and 200-day reside. They are flat for now and would offer major resistance on any rally.In SummaryIt has been a tough year at the carnival, but the show must go on. The back-to-school report was positive, but the company needs a full quarter to change the trend in the stock.Bulls need to be cautious of the $20 level and for now, there seems to be better places to put money to work.Additional content:Low Cost vs. Compromised Security: The Payments Space DilemmaLate last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that payments technology juggernauts like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. intended to hike credit card fees paid by merchants when they accept cards from customers, which were expected to materialize in October and April. However, the companies avidly disagreed with the claims and painted a picture that asked some credible questions.CMSPI, a consulting firm, told the Wall Street Journal that the new fee structure will likely boost costs to merchants by an additional $502 million per year. More than half of that amount would come from network charges, while interchange fees, commonly known as swipe fees, were expected to provide the rest.Per Nilson Report, last year, U.S. merchants paid around $93 billion to Visa and Mastercard in credit-card fees, which surged from the 2012 level of $33 billion. It should also be noted that the volume of digital transactions has significantly jumped during this time, along with the revenues of the merchants.Mastercard stated that it has no intention of hiking network fees or interchange rates in the United States this fall. Visa said through a blog post that its overall interchange fees on its network remained flat for the past ten years. It also pointed out some programs it launched to reduce interchange fees. Last year, it decreased fees by 10% for 90% of businesses in the United States. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The PuzzleIncreased competition in the payment processing market can potentially reduce swipe fees for merchants, which the regulators and legislators have been talking about for some time (Credit Card Competition Act bill), but it can negatively impact security. As cheaper payment does not automatically translate to the same or higher level of security, which is already being provided by companies like V and MA, it can push merchants and other stakeholders in the payments space to increase fraud detection and security-related investments.With growing digital transactions, attempted frauds and security threats increased many folds, leading to higher demand for better and more effective security technologies and related R&amp;D, which comes with expensive price tags. It will likely be difficult for some smaller rivals to cough up such amounts from the get-go.Moreover, lower credit card processing fees can affect rewards programs and similar services. To compensate for lower revenues from processing fees, financial institutions, including credit card issuers can cut back rewards, which will impact the consumers.What About the Smaller Merchants?The legislators argue that the new measures will inject competition in the payments space through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks, which will likely increase the decision-making power of the merchants and break up the duopoly. This can reduce costs for merchants, which is crucial, especially for the smaller ones who were badly hurt during the pandemic and from inflationary pressures.Lower credit card fees are expected to provide some impetus to the margins of small businesses, which account for the vast majority of the total U.S. businesses. This is important, keeping in mind that the U.S. unemployment rate was at 3.8% in August, up from 3.5% at 2022-end. Although the latest rate is well below 5.2% witnessed in August 2021, it is still the highest since March 2022.As both sides have some valid points, all eyes are on the legislative developments waiting to see how the situation plays out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Last year was a disappointing one as the Fed pursued aggressive monetary control with a massive hike in the benchmark lending rate to combat 40-year high inflation. However, this space has witnessed rangebound trading in the past month.A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies. At present, the interest rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%, its highest in more than 22 years. Market participants were worried following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement last month at the Jackson Hole Annual Policy Symposium that the central bank is open to more rate hikes depending on economic data.However, on Sep 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift from its rigorous interest rate hike policy, the Fed would restrain rom a rate hike at this month’s FOMC meeting. Moreover, the journal reported that Fed officials are considering all aspects about whether more rate hikes are al all needed this year.The inflation rate has declined steadily since June 2022. Although currently it is well above the Fed’s 2% target level, majority of Fed officials are of the view that further tightening of monetary policies may be detrimental to the economy. Monetary policy variables always affect the economy at a lag period. Therefore, Fed officials believe that the central bank should wait for the full effect of the current level of interest rate to be visible.As a result, prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) are likely to regain momentum in fourth-quarter 2023.Stocks in FocusNVIDIA Corp.

(NASDAQ:MARA) along with institutions must be dismayed after last week's 15% decrease",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/both-retail-investors-control-good-105459988.html,1694602499,STORY,['MARA'],"[Key InsightsMarathon Digital Holdings' significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger publicThe top 25 shareholders own 34% of the company Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is retail investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).While institutions, who own 35% shares weren’t spared from last week’s US$54m market cap drop, retail investors as a group suffered the maximum lossesLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Marathon Digital Holdings, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Digital Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Digital Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Marathon Digital Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Marathon Digital Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marathon Digital Holdings. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 3.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Marathon Digital HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$9.4m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 51% of Marathon Digital Holdings shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   5 warning signs for Marathon Digital Holdings (2 make us uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

With approximately 4.2 million home sales expected in 2023, Realtor.com® analyzed the numbers in its fifth annual Best Time to Buy Report, identifying key factors to consider when buying a home, apart from mortgage rates. According to the new report: inventory, prices, and competition from other buyers are in peak alignment across the nation during the week of Oct. 1, offering homebuyers a window of opportunity to make the most of their purchase this year.This early-fall period will offer buyers the most favorable moment to buy during the remainder of the year, with more home listings, less competition, and lower prices. This week may offer:Up to 17% more active listings than at the start of the year.Savings of more than $15,000 relative to the summer's peak price of $445,000More time to decide as homes are expected to stay on the market for one week longer than during this year's peakLess competition with demand expected to be 18.7% lower than peak buying periods""Mortgage rates have been more than 6% since September 2022 and could continue this trend for another year. Even as prices fell this summer, the monthly payment to finance a median-priced home was still more than 20% higher than last year,""1 said Danielle Hale, chief economist, Realtor.com®. ""Mortgage rates continue to be a big wild card for Americans hoping to buy a home. Our analysis shows that buying in the fall does give buyers some more predictable advantages that could potentially ease the pain of higher rates and other stressful aspects of the home buying process, including making fast decisions and bidding wars.""Story continuesHale added, ""For buyers trying to close this fall, saving a search on Realtor.com® can help them stay up to date on homes in their price range without the work of having to refresh or recreate their search.""Since 2018, Realtor.com® has analyzed home prices, inventory, listing views, and time on market, indicators that tend to follow regular seasonal patterns, to determine the best time to buy. Here's how these factors breakdown during this unique window:Reduced Prices: Historically, an average of 5.5% of homes have price reductions during the Best Time to Buy period, which means roughly 40,000 homes across the U.S. could see price reductions, based on inventory estimates. During this week, prices typically dip 3.3%, compared to the typical season high, translating to $15,000 in savings. And in several of the largest housing markets around the country, home prices during the best week to buy can dip more than 10% below their peak price earlier in the year, potentially saving buyers tens of thousands of dollars.Increased Listings To Choose From: This year, inventory will likely be lower than in years past as hesitant sellers shy away from the market. However, seasonal inventory trends are still expected and project 11.7% more active listings for the week of Oct.1 than the average week of the year, and 17.2% more than the start of the year.Less Competition From Other Buyers: Home buyers shopping during the best week to buy can expect less competition from other buyers. This year, we saw a return to some pre-pandemic home shopping trends – with the most views per listing in the spring, and prospective buyers continuing to explore the housing market during the summer months – meaning fewer buyers to compete with this fall. While there may still be more competition than pre-pandemic, buyers can expect demand to be 18.7% lower than peak buying periods in 2023, and 13.5% lower than the average week.A More Manageable Timeline: While homes are still spending less time on the market than pre-pandemic, the breakneck pace of the housing market has slowed. During the best time to buy, buyers can spend more time considering their options rather than making quick decisions, and sellers may become more flexible as their listings linger. Historically slowing by 29% compared to the year's peak pace – homes were on the market for an average of 43 days in June 2023 – buyers can expect more than one week extra to deliberate in early October.More Fresh Listings: Despite the count of new listings having fallen this year as homeowners hesitate to sell amidst financial concerns tied to record-high mortgage rates, new listing declines have leveled off. Historically, the best week to buy has seen the addition of 18.9% more homes than at the start of the year, and early October is set to offer the highest influx of fresh listings compared to the remainder of the year.Methodology:Realtor.com analyzed six supply and demand metrics at a national and metropolitan level that follow seasonal patterns, using data for 2018-2022 period (2020 data was omitted due to anomalies caused by the pandemic). Those metrics analyzed include: 1) listing prices, 2) inventory levels, 3) new ""fresh"" listings, 4) time on market, 5) homebuyer demand (realtor.com views per property) and 6) price reductions. Interest rates, which do not follow seasonal patterns, were not included. To account for 2022 market conditions, estimates reflect typical seasonal patterns layered on top of the most recent 2022 weekly data.Each week of the year was scored from 0 to 100 based on the number of active listings. A given week scored highly if it had more listings compared to other weeks of the year. The other metrics were scored in the same way, such that each week had six different scores for active listings, new listings, listing prices, days on market, price reductions, and views per property. (In the case of prices, lower prices score higher. Same with views per property).Each week was then ranked by the average of those scores. The week with the highest composite score was considered the best time to buy. This week represents a balanced view of market conditions favorable for buyers.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

But as many discover the hard way, the strategy is easier said than done.Stocks don't always go up. Even though the S&amp;P 500 is up 17% in 2023, it's still down compared to where it was at the end of 2021.The good news? You don't have to actively trade stocks to make money. You can also collect dividends.With the right dividend stocks, investors can bypass the stress and uncertainty associated with attempting to time the market while benefiting from a steady stream of passive income.Business magnate John D. Rockefeller once said, ""Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It's to see my dividends coming in.""But most companies don't pay much these days.

251,f5535cec-ccdd-31a9-8b72-93f57c478500,VZ,2023-09-13,Verizon is the network for football fans in Seattle,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-network-football-fans-seattle-150000554.html,1694530800,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCEnhancements to Lumen Field, Coach-to-Coach Private Network, and increased availability of 5G Home Internet support fans, players and coaches on the field or on their couches.SEATTLE, Sept. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whether coaching on the field, cheering from their seats, managing their fantasy league from home or hosting a watch party, Verizon is the network for football fans in Seattle. Verizon now provides connectivity engineered to enhance the fan experience – from helping fans with quick and reliable communications, to catching and sharing all the action on the field. Verizon recently upgraded its 5G Ultra Wideband network inside Lumen Field and throughout Seattle.Keeping fans connected at the gameThe unprecedented investment and network improvements at Lumen Field allows for better performance and greater capacity to accommodate fans’ needs. Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service is designed for high performance and huge capacity that fans needs at every home game. It covers the field, bowl, suite and club level, concourse, and the WAMU Theater.With these network enhancements, customers can do many more things on their mobile phones when connected during games and events. From sharing their experience in the stadium to using their phones for getting refreshments, Verizon has customers covered. Our network can also support fans as they keep tabs on fantasy leagues and players’ stats, gain entrance to the stadium and more. This exponential increase in data uses in and out of the stadium require upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to connect the stadium to the rest of the network.As fans enter and leave the stadium or enjoy tailgating, multiple macro cell sites will provide 4G and 5G Ultra Wideband coverage using Verizon’s premium Millimeter Wave (mmWave) spectrum as well as their newly acquired C-band spectrum designed for high performance and wider coverage. Verizon also manages several small cells around the stadium to offload traffic for fans walking to/from the stadium towards additional parking locations and public transit stations.Story continuesKeeping coaches and players connected at the gameVerizon’s Managed Private Wireless Solution, coach-to-coach communications is officially live in all 30 NFL stadiums, including Lumen Field, a major milestone in the co-innovation partnership between Verizon and the NFL. This Managed Private Wireless solution was initially piloted during all five international NFL games in the 2022 season, which included deployment and management of the private wireless technology, testing and coordination and in-game operational support and continued this pre-season. The Verizon engineered private network is deployed at field level of each stadium leveraging antennas which allow for full coverage throughout the field, providing the NFL with the reliability they need for critical on field coach-to-coach communication.This solution is part of the broader Verizon Business Connected Venue approach, which is rooted in its 5G investment in more than 75 large public venues in the United States, including some of the most iconic major sports and music venues. Verizon brings a mix of public and private network capabilities, a robust technology ecosystem, and 5G partnerships that enable leagues, teams, and stadium operators to create and deliver a first-class fan experience and achieve desired venue operations outcomes. Examples include autonomous or cashierless retail, accelerated access, and crowd analytics as a service.Keeping fans at home connected to the actionFor fans celebrating their love of the game at home, Verizon has them covered too. More than 77% of people in the Seattle area are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of new macro cell sites and small cell sites. Customers in Puyallup, Kenmore, Monroe, and Northeast Tacoma, WA are now able to experience the speed and security of 5G Ultra Wideband service. Furthermore, customers in the Cherry Hill and Squire Park neighborhoods of Seattle can now take advantage of our premium mmWave service. In the coming months, additional enhancements will be made to increase coverage and capacity in Deming and Port Orchard, WA to improve our overall customer experience in these cities.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using mmWave, its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added mmWave most notably in Capitol Hill, Ballard, Green Lake, Queen Anne, Highline, Central Tacoma, Proctor, Hilltop, Kirkland, Bellevue, Mercer Island and Renton.Verizon recently announced that it now has access to the total amount of 5G C-band spectrum awarded at auction in March 2021 – four months ahead of schedule. Seattle residents and visitors will now be able to use a full 160 MHz of spectrum, nearly tripling the 5G bandwidth available to serve customers throughout Seattle. This allows Verizon to more quickly expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, providing much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services, as well as enable higher data speeds. This additional spectrum will also allow Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers throughout Seattle.The recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Seattle, WA, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Seattle, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in the categories of accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Seattle with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 84% and median upload speeds increasing 18% since last year* in the market and peak download speeds of up to 396 Mbps.*Rankings based on the RootMetrics® Seattle RootScore® Report: 1H 2023.

Oregon holds shares in the company worth approximately $5.2 million.The complaint, which does not specify what damages it seeks, alleges Fox's board decided to broadcast former President Donald Trump's election falsehoods in order to satisfy his supporters, while knowing that doing so would expose the company to lawsuits.“Defendants chose to invite robust defamation claims, with potentially huge financial liability and potentially larger business repercussions, rather than disappoint viewers of Fox News,” the lawsuit said.In April, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.Dominion had argued that the news outlet damaged its reputation by airing phony conspiracy theories that its equipment switched votes from Trump to Democrat Joe Biden.Lachlan Murdoch, chair and CEO of Fox Corp., said when the settlement was announced that it avoided “the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”Story continuesAnother voting machine company, Smartmatic USA, also sued Fox News over its coverage of election conspiracy theories.In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said the Fox breached its fiduciary duties by disregarding legal risks.“The directors’ choices exposed themselves and the company to liability and exposed their shareholders to significant risks,"" she said. “That is the crux of our lawsuit, and we look forward to making our case in court.”]"

Robinson goes to the border.(Photo: memegenerator.net)It’s every brokerage’s favorite time of the year, National Truck Driver Appreciation Week, running through Saturday. Social media is flooded with #ThankADriver posts and sentimental praises for those who drive for a living. It’s been a tumultuous few years for drivers. Being told they’re heroes during the pandemic, AB5 messing up California and the highest rates followed by rates that aren’t exactly profitable to drive a truck, this year’s Driver Appreciation Week has to be REALLY good.I’ve often said that every week should be Driver Appreciation Week. We should be putting our drivers first and be upfront and honest with everyone and just know that it’s not always the drivers fault, even though sometimes it legitimately is, but they shouldn’t get the blame first. If year-round relationship building is a bit out of scope, then send care packages, have cookouts and do anything else that carriers enjoy.Here’s what some major retailers are doing this week for drivers if you want to pass along the information.Truckstop is helping to promote driver wellness by publishing survey results. A common theme stopping a lot of drivers from being healthier is a lack of parking, whether it’s at a healthy eating spot or somewhere they could work out. Parks, hiking trails and gyms aren’t really semi-truck friendly. Help drivers out and offer up some solid parking options, especially if they’re in areas you’re familiar with.Convoy is having a promotion that any carrier who hauls with Convoy is eligible to save $700 on a two-month trailer rental.Story continuesRaceTrac, a gas station chain in the South, is taking the entire month for in-store promotions, including $4 meal deals. There are free Nathan’s hot dogs this week, and on Friday, there will be item giveaways, including headsets.Pilot is also taking the month to give away free drinks and discounted meals for drivers and is hosting a party in North Little Rock, Arkansas, for drivers on Wednesday.Love’s is also jumping on the discount train but with a twist. Drivers can get a free hot sandwich, bowl or fresh salad with an oil change.Also if you’re planning on what to do next year, check out this episode of PDQ America in which drivers spill the tea on what they actually want for Christmas/Driver Appreciation Week.Is your office doing something cool? Tag me on social media. I want to see every LinkedIn post and every tweet or xeet. (Do we know what it’s being called now?) If you’re a driver, let me know what you actually want for Driver Appreciation Week to feel appreciated.Market Check. Minneapolis is the market that is experiencing the most dramatic softening of freight in the country. Outbound tender rejections have dropped 1,529 basis points week over week (w/w), which is the most I’ve seen any market drop perhaps ever. Not only have outbound tender rejections dropped below 4%, outbound tender volumes, while on the rise, are still down 6.85% w/w. It’s not a great time for a carrier to be in this market, but continued pressure on spot rates could make for some margin-friendly loads.Who’s with whom? C.H. Robinson and Laredo, Texas, have become besties. C.H. has opened a 400,000-square-foot cross-border facility at the U.S.-Mexico border. This new facility can handle up to 350 shipments a day, which is some carrier awards for an entire month. Monterrey, Mexico, is 140 miles away from Laredo. Given that just about every automotive manufacturer is setting up shop in Mexico, it’s not entirely shocking that brokerages are setting up facilities on the other side of the border.The nearshoring demand in Mexico will only grow over the next year and I would not be surprised if this is a common occurrence with more and more brokers. Because of how freight enters the country from Mexico through a transfer carrier at the border, it’s paramount to have facilities that can unload freight quickly so that those transfer carriers can return to the border to haul more freight. “On a day when 350 loads are being picked up, if you reduce load time by an average of 10 minutes, that saves nearly 60 hours in one day,” Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson’s vice president of North America surface transportation, said in Noi Mahoney’s article.How to go about co-brokering deals? byu/Im-not-a-politician inFreightBrokersThis is the ever-popular we’re not a double broker because we signed some paperwork, therefore it’s a co-brokering situation. Thoughts on if it’s a good move off the bat or only for tricky loads that could potentially lose a customer if failed on? Let me know. I’d love to share them with everyone.The more you know Union Pacific defends rail safety program California Senate votes to ban driverless trucksUPS rolls out peak delivery surcharges Amazon rolls out end-to-end global supply chain service The post Check Call: #ThankADriver appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

In fact, it was a win for both sides, according to Wall Street analysts.In late August, Disney had pulled its owned and operated channels including ESPN and ABC off Charter Spectrum cable systems after the two hit a stalemate over whether Disney should give Charter subscribers free access to its ad-supported streaming services as part of the telecom giant's cable packages.The blackout had impacted a slew of high-profile sporting events including the US Open and arrived on the heels of the NFL's debut — upping the pressure for both sides to make a deal.A blue screen message on Spectrum TV over the ESPN channel amid a dispute between Disney and Charter Spectrum on Sept. 6, 2023, in Los Angeles, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)On Monday, the companies announced they had reached an agreement to end the media blackout. As part of the deal, Charter will offer some Disney streaming services — the ad-supported version of Disney+, ESPN+, and ESPN's yet-to-be launched direct-to-consumer offering — as part of select cable packages at no additional cost to the consumer.""Disney and Charter finally reached a settlement that looks like a win-win for both,"" Macquarie's Tim Nollen wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""In the end this wasn't as revolutionary a deal as Charter seemed poised to hold out for, but it does move the sticks down the field toward a fully streaming future.""MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson agreed, writing in a note released late Monday: ""While perhaps not the end of the Pay TV world as we know it, we very much can look back at this Disney/Charter deal as an opening salvo of a broader re-bundling and a step in giving customers smaller linear bundles with increased streaming video-on-demand functionality.""Charter has focused on offering more bundles amid the cord-cutting phenomenon, hence its desire to include more streaming plans in packages. On top of that, Disney plans to take ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer streaming service — another incentive for Charter to lean into streaming.Story continuesAs part of the deal, the Disney+ Basic ad-supported offering will be provided to Charter customers who purchase the Spectrum TV Select package at no additional cost, ""as part of a wholesale arrangement.""Nollen said Disney stands to gain additional revenue of about $400 million to $500 million annually as a result of this arrangement, assuming the addition of roughly 12 million subscribers through Charter.That's welcome news for Disney as its ad-supported tier has struggled to scale, with only 3.3 million subscribers as of June, according to an estimate from MoffettNathanson.On top of the Disney+ offering, ESPN+ will be provided to Spectrum TV Select Plus subscribers at no additional cost. The ESPN flagship direct-to-consumer service will also be made available at no extra cost to Spectrum TV Select subscribers when it launches.""For Charter — this might be the biggest win but at the same time likely something Disney knew was inevitable as part of future affiliate deals,"" Nathanson wrote.But Nollen said it's also a win for Disney considering ESPN+ will likewise see a rise in its viewer base — even if that means no subscriber revenue.""The new ESPN OTT service will have a built-in starting point on subs from Charter when it launches, and Disney can benefit from Charter marketing its DTC offerings to its broadband subscriber base, which totals 28.5 million residential households,"" he said.'Setting a precedent'Disney is planning a new ESPN streaming service. (David Kohl/AP Photo, File)Spectrum will continue to carry the ABC Owned Television Stations, Disney Channel, FX, and the Nat Geo Channel, in addition to the full suite of ESPN networks.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro indicated Disney was able to secure ""very strong"" rate increases for ESPN — a ""critical"" element to the deal, according to Nathanson.""Without any real change to minimums, Disney securing 'very strong' rate increases at ESPN over a multi-year deal is critical to improve the trajectory of the US linear network business,"" he said.""Disney needs to see higher rate inflation to offset the acceleration in industry cord-cutting now reaching about 7%, without any real sign of slowing down. Importantly, the extent of the higher ESPN rates will be a big driver in what future sports rights deals ESPN/Disney is able or willing to afford,"" the analyst continued.Still, Disney did give up a host of networks in exchange for the strong rates. Networks that will no longer be included in Spectrum TV video packages are Baby TV, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo Wild, and Nat Geo Mundo.""Without knowing the specifics of the deal, it is hard to say whether price increases Disney won for its remaining networks will be enough to fully offset this loss, pegging this as a win for Charter,"" Nathanson noted. ""Based on rough estimates of what Charter had been paying for coverage, we believe the removal of these networks will cost Disney in the range of $300 million per year in high margin lost affiliate fees.""""Like much of this deal, we anticipate this setting a precedent for similar surgical culling in all future renegotiations across the industry,"" he added.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today published a new research study examining the trends behind the Media and Entertainment (M&amp;E) industry's adoption of cloud technologies. The study, commissioned by Akamai and conducted by Forrester Consulting, surveyed 225 respondents from M&amp;E businesses globally, the majority of whom either influence or have final decision-making authority over streaming architectures and/or cloud workflows within their organizations. The results showed that 73% of M&amp;E businesses are considering moving away from large, legacy cloud providers in favor of more portable, cloud-native setups due to cost pressures, among other findings.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)High customer expectations driving cloud adoption in the M&amp;E sectorM&amp;E businesses were early cloud adopters, with 92% of respondents reporting they are either ""successful"" or ""very successful"" with cloud-based technology, and 77% reporting their cloud journeys are progressing faster than expected. This uptake has been driven by high customer expectations, with 76% of those surveyed reporting their users expect zero downtime, buffering, or playback errors.Looking ahead, however, the report highlighted concerns around the ability of existing cloud infrastructures to future-proof the M&amp;E industry's growth. According to the Forrester study, ""M&amp;E companies are reevaluating their cloud provider relationships, seeking trusted partners to overcome top challenges and accelerate content production.""Business costs, data growth are top of mind for the M&amp;E industryRising costs are having a notable impact on M&amp;E businesses' cloud strategies. Among respondents, 73% are considering moving away from traditional cloud providers due to cost pressures, while 63% report the costs are difficult for their business to manage long-term.Story continuesIncreasing data volume is highlighted in the report as complicating respondents' abilities to further adopt cloud infrastructures. Thirty-six percent anticipate more than 50% growth in data volume over the next three years, and 68% agree that data volume complicates infrastructure adoption.""Cloud provider partners must evolve to meet M&amp;E customers' data demands,"" according to the Forrester study. ""As many consider refactoring their cloud provider relationships, they seek partners to meet them where they are and help with their cost, data egress, and hosting needs.""Key cloud use casesStorage is the most common streaming use case for cloud services, according to nearly 60% of respondents. Meanwhile, at least half of the organizations surveyed are also using the cloud for key functions like content protection (DRM/watermarking), billing and subscription management, and performance analysis.""This research shows the dynamic nature of the workloads that M&amp;E businesses are running on cloud services and infrastructures today. What's more, the research also reveals that an impressive number of those businesses — half or more — are using the cloud for some of their most critical functions,"" said Todd Loewenstein, Akamai senior manager of media industry marketing. ""As more and more content becomes available to consumers through over-the-top (OTT) services, M&amp;E businesses need to store and protect this content on a cloud that can scale with their changing needs.""Competitive advantageWith M&amp;E, and video streaming services in particular, becoming an increasingly crowded market, businesses are looking to cloud providers to help them improve the customer experience (CX) and retain a competitive advantage. Sixty percent said they have seen or would expect to see CX improvements thanks to cloud investments, and 59% have realized or would expect increased ability to generate and access real-time insights.""The study helps quantify what we're hearing from customers and prospects about the current state of their cloud journeys,"" said Loewenstein. ""They're under huge pressures to deliver standout customer experiences while operating under intense budgetary constraints.""""While these challenges are especially pronounced in M&amp;E, they're shared by businesses in other industries. This is one of the reasons Akamai is taking a fundamentally different approach to cloud computing,"" Loewenstein added.

In a development partnership with ServiceNow, F5 has contributed approximately 40,000 lines of code to double the compressibility of the OpenTelemetry Protocol. This innovation reduces the costs of exporting data from data centers, clouds, and edge locations to a telemetry platform by half, depending on the specific data workload. To put the size of this contribution in perspective, the typical software developer produces between 10,000 and 25,000 lines of code each year and the average open source project comprises around 35,000 lines of code.Optimizing the collection, ingestion, and analysis of telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces enables organizations to more efficiently and performantly deliver intelligent, automated responses amidst variable IT conditions. As an example, telemetry can help security teams detect and prevent fraudulent and nefarious activities by comparing login and behavioral characteristics of users and applications against typical usage patterns. Customers who export such telemetry data from public clouds to a telemetry aggregation system using this new refinement to the OpenTelemetry Protocol can expect their egress costs related to telemetry traffic to be reduced by 50%.""Modern networking solutions, applications, and users generate unfathomably large volumes of data in the course of everyday operations, making compression rates essential to bringing the benefits of comprehensive telemetry to more organizations in a cost-effective manner,"" said Laurent Quérel, project lead and distinguished engineer at F5. ""While today’s enterprises are much better suited to capture and analyze data versus their historical counterparts, challenges have persisted around effective transport, centralization, and standardization, which is why F5 has invested in the OpenTelemetry project. By adopting OpenTelemetry across the F5 portfolio—and continuing to participate in leading open source efforts with organizations like ServiceNow—we see limitless use cases to make applications more adaptive to changes in their runtime environment via performance assessment, added efficiencies, and enhanced forensics while keeping customer costs to a minimum.""Story continuesBeginning with attempts to further optimize the OpenTelemetry Protocol in the context of Apache Arrow to significantly increase processing speed and reduce bandwidth costs, F5 partnered with ServiceNow Cloud Observability to introduce the OpenTelemetry Arrow Project and reference implementation guidance. Apache Arrow is an open source technology enhancing big data, analytics, and machine learning used to provide standardized representations of structured and semi-structured data in a more actionable, digestible format and promote advanced telemetry capabilities.For many organizations, transporting and processing such data efficiently accounts for a significant portion of the cost associated with telemetry pipelines. Standardizing telemetry is especially critical because sufficient observability and AI-driven analysis require a uniform intake of data points from the entire IT stack. Protocol enhancements and standards developed and refined within an open source community provide surrounding industries with a powerful ecosystem of projects and solution infrastructure to build out tailored capabilities specific to their organizations and users. This approach also gives F5 customers heightened visibility into the immediate factors impacting their applications, better positioning IT teams to make strategic investments over time.""When Lightstep co-founded the OpenTelemetry project, our goal was to work within the open source community to help enterprises maximize visibility without increasing spend,"" said Daniel ""Spoons"" Spoonhower, chief architect at ServiceNow Cloud Observability, formerly known as Lightstep. ""Through this work with F5, we’re continuing to execute on what enterprises need—the ability to ship more data at a lower cost.""Additional ResourcesF5’s OpenTelemetry Contribution Advances Our Adaptive Apps Vision – F5 BlogCloud Data Control: Introducing the OpenTelemetry Arrow Project – ServiceNow BlogOpenTelemetry Arrow Protocol SpecificationOpenTelemetry Arrow Encoding/Decoding Reference ImplementationOur Journey at F5 with Apache Arrow (Part 1)Our Journey at F5 with Apache Arrow (Part 2)About F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize every app and API anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

The global crude benchmark rose to $92.83 earlier in the day, reaching its highest since November 2022.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled at $88.52, down 32 cents, or 0.4%. The U.S. crude benchmark hit a 10-month high of $89.64 earlier.Average daily oil output for last week was estimated at 12.9 million barrels, the the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. Until a couple of months ago, crude output from the world’s largest producer of the commodity ranged between 12.1M and 12.2M barrels per day.Last week’s revision means U.S. oil production is now just 400,000 short of the record high of 13.1M barrels per day averaged in March 2020, just before the coronavirus outbreak which temporarily decimated energy demand.On the inventory side, U.S. crude oil stockpiles jumped nearly 4M barrels last week and fuel inventories rose by as much or more, indicating lower demand as the summer driving season officially drew to a close.Specifically, the U.S. U.S. crude inventory balance was higher by 3.955M barrels during the week ended September 8. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude drawdown of 2.481M barrels instead for last week to add to the 6.307 million deficit in the prior week to September 1.On the fuels side, the EIA reported a gasoline inventory increase of 5.561M. The forecast consensus was for a gasoline draw of 0.85M barrels that would have added to the prior week’s decline of 2.666M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a build of 3.931M barrels versus the expected gain of 1.4M and the prior week’s rise of 0.679M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Story continuesFuel demand collapses The growth in both crude and fuel supplies coincided with the winding down of summer driving in the United States last week, marked by the Sept. 4 Labor Day holiday. Prior to that, refiners had drawn nearly 20M barrels of crude from inventory over a period of four weeks as they maxed out fuel processing to meet demand. Refiners had maintained an extraordinarily high run rate of more than 93% of their capacity during the period.As of last week, the EIA said although US refineries were still operating at high run rates, the amount of crude that they turned into fuel was less than before.“Refineries operated at 93.7% of their operable capacity last week,” the EIA said in its latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report. “Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 9.2 million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased last week, averaging 5.0 million barrels per day.”Demand for fuels also fell as the peak summer driving bowed out, the EIA market summary showed. Total gasoline supplied to the marketplace — a key indicator of consumption — fell to a daily average of 8.307M from the prior week’s 9.321M. Gasoline consumption below the daily mark of 9 million is often a red flag for demand, and such usage levels are typical in off-peak periods of demand like now.Exports of U.S. crude down too, oil Imports up Alongside domestic demand, exports of U.S. crude — one of the bright spots of the weekly EIA report for months now — fell last week to 3.090M barrels per day from the previous week’s 4.932M.But imports of crude grew as refiners appeared to pull more oil into the country in anticipation of demand. According to the EIA. U.S. crude imports averaged 7.6 million barrels per day last week, up 0.812M from the prior week. Imports grew despite aggressive supply cuts by Saudi Arabia, which has been trying to channel less crude towards the United States in its bid to skew EIA’s weekly reporting into a more bullish picture for oil.Joined by the Russians, who announced a 300,000 barrels per day cut from this month, the Saudis’ voluntary reduction of 1.0M barrels daily have had an exaggerated impact on oil prices, sending both Brent and WTI to 10-month highs.High fuel prices also caused U.S. consumer prices to rise a second month in a row and reach a year-on-year growth of 3.7%, according to Labor Department data on Wednesday that placed renewed pressure on inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.U.S. headline inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, hit 40-year highs of more than 9% in June 2022 before falling to as low as 3.0% by June last year. Since then, it has been on the rise, adding a rounded-up 0.7% over the past two months, as high global oil prices bumped up fuel costs at home.“Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 3.7 percent before seasonal adjustment,” the Labor Department said in a news release. “The index for gasoline was the largest contributor to the monthly all items increase, accounting for over half of the increase.”(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil rally pauses as U.S. crude stockpiles jump; output at new 3-year highHuman activity jeopardising Earth's life-support systems -studyU.S. crude oil stocks up 4M Bbls, first climb in 5 weeks; fuels surge too - EIA]"

Prior to that, refiners had drawn nearly 20 million barrels of crude from inventory over a period of four weeks as they maxed out fuel processing for the summer driving period.The U.S. crude inventory balance possibly dipped by 1.174M barrels during the week ended Sept. 8, according to the API, or American Petroleum Institute.The petroleum industry group reported a crude draw of 5.521M barrels in the prior week to Sept. 1.The API numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, on Wednesday.Notwithstanding the broader crude stockpile gain it reported for last week, the API cited a drop of 2.417M barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that takes delivery of U.S. crude. In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of ​​1.35M barrels.On the fuels side, API reported a gasoline build of 4.210M barrels and a distillate gain of 2.592M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 5.09M barrel draw for gasoline and a 0.31M gain for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that have risen more than 10% over the past two weeks as Saudi-Russian productions prompted the trade to prioritize supply reduction over real demand.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.299 million barrels, versus the 5.96M barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug 11.Story continuesOn the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a build of 0.436M barrels over the 0.261M-barrel decline in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a climb of 0.095million barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.296M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Related ArticlesU.S. crude oil stocks up first time in 5 weeks, fuel inventories climb too - APICitgo valued at $32 billion-$40 billion ahead of auction of shares -court hearingPanama Canal to further reduce daily transits if drought continues]"

To decide if this trend could continue, we decided to look at its weak fundamentals as they shape the long-term market trends. In this article, we decided to focus on Juniper Networks'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Juniper Networks is:9.5% = US$412m ÷ US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Juniper Networks' Earnings Growth And 9.5% ROEOn the face of it, Juniper Networks' ROE is not much to talk about. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.5%. Having said that, Juniper Networks' net income growth over the past five years is more or less flat. Remember, the company's ROE is not particularly great to begin with. So that could also be one of the reasons behind the company's flat growth in earnings.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Juniper Networks' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 33% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is JNPR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Juniper Networks Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Juniper Networks has a high three-year median payout ratio of 75% (or a retention ratio of 25%), meaning that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This does go some way in explaining why there's been no growth in its earnings.Additionally, Juniper Networks has paid dividends over a period of nine years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, Juniper Networks' performance is quite a big let-down. As a result of its low ROE and lack of much reinvestment into the business, the company has seen a disappointing earnings growth rate. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

""Money is looking for the next horse to jump on in this race to year-end.""At the forefront of market participants' minds is the crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) report expected on Wednesday, which should shed further light on the meandering, downward path of inflation and provide some clarity regarding the direction of key interest rates.While core CPI is seen cooling, rising fuel costs are forecast to result in hotter headline inflation, which is unlikely to escape the Fed's attention.One week from today, the central bank is due to convene its two-day policy meeting, which is broadly expected to culminate in an interest rate pause.""People are in a holding pattern waiting to understand policy, and policy goes back to inflation, the labor market, prices and consumer demand,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food industry and changing trends, you can skip and go straight to the 5 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US.According to a study conducted by the CDC, almost 37% of American adults consume fast food on any given day, according to the CDC. Fast food is a pertinent part of the American lifestyle, with few whose weeks would be complete without it. This massive consumption rate has created a vast industry for this product, filled with many international and local fast food chains. As Grand View Research puts it, the global fast food market size had an estimated value of $596 billion in 2021. The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% between the years 2022 to 2029. The combined product segment of all kinds of burgers and sandwiches accounted for more than 42% of this industry, taking up the largest chunk. According to the US Department of Agriculture, as many as 50 billion burgers are consumed yearly in the US.The fast food industry has also been one to go through a multitude of significant changes in the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic upturned the way the entire industry functions. On the one hand, an estimated 5 to 7 million workers lost their jobs during the pandemic; meanwhile, demand for food delivery services grew tremendously, resulting in long-term consumer preferences towards online delivery systems due to convenience. The food delivery apps industry is predicted to reach $165 billion by 2029. The rise in snacking habits of Americans is also increasing the demand for fast food services, most of which have whole menu categories dedicated to snacking options. Lastly, the demand for food that is produced from healthier ingredients and creates a lesser carbon footprint has also increased, leading many fast food chains to reevaluate their ingredient choices. Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is the largest fast food chain in the US, with 13,520 restaurants nationwide and a revenue of over $23 billion earned in 2022. The corporation employs around 210,000 people and has showcased a revenue growth of 74.84% from 2019 to 2022. The company generated a revenue of $5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023, consistently showcasing a steady increase. The revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $5.6 billion, However, such huge revenues mean that Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) has also significantly contributed to raising greenhouse gas emissions. The corporation now targets a net-zero emission goal, to be achieved by 2050. Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is also designing restaurants that are more sustainable, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and transitioning to the use of sustainable materials for packaging and Happy Meal toys. The fast food giant also has plans to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2030. Story continuesYum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) owns Taco Bell, one of the largest Mexican cuisine chains in the US, which had an estimated revenue of $1 billion in 2022. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) also owns KFC, another division that brings in significant revenue for the company, and is famous all around the US for its fried chicken. The corporation also has Pizza Hut’s ownership, along with that of a fast-casual brand, The Habit Burger Grill. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) has delivered a record number of new restaurants in recent years, with 4,560 new units opened in 2022 alone. They have also added menu innovations on almost all their chains, roping in customers to try out new items. The corporation is employing more contemporary technology tools in order to aid an ongoing data strategy that aims to enhance consumer experiences. To encapsulate, the US fast food industry is incorporating new trends every day, with each company trying to stay ahead of the other. In that race, we have compiled a list of the 25 most popular fast foods in the US that consumers swear by. 25 Most Popular Fast Foods in the USTMON/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology: One of the most solid ways of gauging popular fast foods is to take a look at consumer opinions. For the purpose of this article, we have collected data from the social media site Reddit, where individuals have often expressed their views on the different fast food items available in the US. These 25 items have been ranked based on the number of times each was mentioned or upvoted. Based on consumer preferences, here are the 25 most popular fast foods in the US:25. Jalapeno PoppersScore: 04Research has shown that more than half of US consumers now consume three or more snacks in a day. The rising demand for snacking options has led to the popularity of items like jalapeno poppers, which can be regularly eaten in bite-sized meals. The dish as we know it has its historical origins in Central America and Mexico, but its modern version originated in the US. 24. Steak BurgerScore: 04Beef steak is an extremely popular meal option in the US, with nearly two out of every three Americans selecting it as a last meal option, as reported by Fox. The fast food version of that, the steak burger, is widely increasing in popularity as well. Experts are also considering whether steak burgers can pass hamburgers in demand. Although the possibility is a little far off into the future, it does exist. 23. Chicken Strips Score: 05In 2021, Fortune reported that the rising popularity of chicken items across US restaurant chains had led to a poultry shortage in the country. KFC, Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD), and other fast food chains like Popeyes were responsible for this increasing trend. Thus, chicken strips are one of the items on this list of most popular fast foods in the US, being eaten as appetizers all over the country. 22. Hot Dogs Score: 05According to Fortune Business Insights, New Yorkers alone spent $133.6 million on hot dogs in retail in 2020. As the working population grows, so does the demand for quick, ready-to-eat foods, leading to higher consumption of hot dogs. In order to widen their consumer base, hot dog manufacturers are not also experimenting with newer flavors, bringing more variety into the market. Due to these changing trends, hot dogs are quickly growing as one of the most popular US fast foods. 21. Milkshakes Score: 07The versatility of this breakfast drink is one of the main reasons it retains massive popularity in the US fast food industry. Milkshakes can be adjusted to meet any changing trend in the beverage industry, such as the rising demand for coffee flavors, increased purchases of alcoholic drinks, and the need for seasonal drinks. The incorporation of changing market dynamics ensures that the beverage always stays relevant.20. Mozzarella SticksScore: 07The entire US cheese sticks market was valued at $1.51 billion in 2022, and the mozzarella sticks segment dominated this market by gathering over 55% of its share. Mozzarella is also the best-loved cheese among consumers, making it a popular option for snacks and fast foods. DoorDash also reported that mozzarella sticks were the most-ordered game-day food during the 2020-2021 NFL season.  19. Sliders Score: 07White Castle, a popular US burger chain, can be credited with creating the first slider in the 1920s. In 2023, the company reached the groundbreaking number of 29 billion sliders sold since the product was first launched. Sliders have gained such popularity because they offer appetizer portions of one of the most popular fast foods in the US - burgers. 18. Egg RollsScore: 08Egg rolls have been an essential part of the menus at Chinese restaurants for quite a while, but their popularity has also managed to penetrate the American fast food industry. The Asian-inspired flavors tend to bring a comforting experience to consumers while also providing a fulfilling snack. 17. DoughnutsScore: 09Corporations like Krispy Kreme Inc (NASDAQ:DNUT) have made a huge impact on the doughnut industry in the US. The company reported a revenue of $1.53 billion in 2022, achieved by a revenue growth of 10.5%.  The changing trends in the food industry have led doughnut manufacturers to introduce gluten-free, dairy-free, whole-grain, or even keto products. The industry has performed well in terms of responding to the demands surrounding it, due to which doughnuts continue to be one of the most popular fast food items in the US.  16. PizzasScore: 10According to the Washington Post, 40% of Americans consume pizza at least once a week, making it one of the most popular fast food items in the US. Research says that the unique combination of ingredients in a pizza and its manufacturing processes make for a dish that people tend to enjoy. Domino's Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) is one of the most famous pizza chains in the country.15. NachosScore: 11Nachos have gained massive popularity as appetizers and especially as movie theatre snacks. Despite their higher prices and initial skepticism, many cinema-goers need this staple snack for their entire experience. What started out as a novelty food item available at only a couple of cinemas quickly spread to fast food chains and theatres all over the country. 14. WingsScore: 12 According to the American Chicken Council, US residents consume over 1.45 billion chicken wings on just the Super Bowl weekend alone, as reported by USA Today. This fast food item has become synonymous with the sport, especially its boneless version. Experts have mentioned that boneless wings are also cheaper to produce, making them quite the staple for the football season. 13. Chicken TendersScore: 13Chicken tenders tend to yield huge profit margins owing to high markups. However, recent years have seen a steady increase in the poultry cut required for this product, as compared to other chicken cuts on the market. Moreover, poultry supplies in the market have also been going through a shortage, and because of their inability to keep up with the demand, prices are driven further upwards. These factors combine to lower the popularity of the chicken tenders, which were once much higher on the list. 12. Beef SandwichScore: 13The global beef market is projected to grow to $604.34 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 5.52%. These numbers showcase the popularity of the meat in the US as well. While steaks and burgers tend to command a higher industry segment, beef sandwiches still make it to the list of some of the most popular fast food items in the US. The specific statistics for sandwich sales by meat type are unavailable. Still, consumer trends have shown a massive preference for beef sandwiches, especially those by companies like Subway or Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). 11. Fish SandwichScore: 13The Filet-O-Fish by Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is a simple sandwich by the corporation that has proven to be popular. As pescetarianism rises as a trend, so does the demand for a seafood-based diet. The global demand for fish is expected to almost double by 2050; hence, it gives fast food corporations an edge to incorporate seafood options as soon as possible. 10. QuesadillasScore: 16Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) are quickly rising in popularity for quesadillas. The corporation has performed well in adapting to changing trends. Just in April 2023, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) added a TikTok-inspired quesadilla to its permanent digital menu, resulting in two of its best-ever digital sales days. 9. BurritosScore: 18Vox has mentioned burritos to be a staple of Mexican-American cuisines. Fast food chains like Taco Bell by Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:TACO) offer multiple variations of the popular item and prove successful with consumers. The combined sales of burritos and quesadillas at Taco Bell jumped 9% in the last quarter of 2022, showcasing that burritos are rising in popularity as one of the most popular fast food items in the US. 8. Breakfast SandwichScore: 18All breakfast items at fast food chains are steadily rising in popularity, making a comeback after the 2020 pandemic saw a decrease in sales. This has led to many chains offering all-day breakfast options as well, with breakfast sandwiches being one of the most in-demand items. Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) entered the breakfast scene just over three years ago, and by the end of 2022, the corporation was already reporting average weekly sales of more than $3,ooo per restaurant. 7. Onion RingsScore: 19Onion rings have proven to be one of the most popular junk-food side dishes in the US, with many people choosing them in addition to their regular fast food orders. While many fast food chains in the US claim the credit for inventing this extraordinary appetizer, everyone can agree that they are an American original. 6. FriesScore: 20Fortune Business Insights valued the global French fries market at around $15 billion in 2021, with an expected market growth at a CAGR of 4.7% until 2029. While every fast food chain in the country offers some version of this staple side dish, Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) is claimed by many to have the best fries in the market. The company reformulated its fries in 2021, adding a ‘hot &amp; crispy’ innovation. Despite the rising popularity of these items, US sales of Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) in 2022 were quite disappointing due to rising inflation.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US.Suggested Articles:12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America10 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right Now20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The WorldDisclosure: None. 25 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food industry and changing trends, you can skip and go straight to the 5 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US.According to a study conducted by the CDC, almost 37% of American adults consume fast food on any given day, according to the CDC. Fast food is a pertinent part of the American lifestyle, with few whose weeks would be complete without it. This massive consumption rate has created a vast industry for this product, filled with many international and local fast food chains. As Grand View Research puts it, the global fast food market size had an estimated value of $596 billion in 2021. The industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% between the years 2022 to 2029. The combined product segment of all kinds of burgers and sandwiches accounted for more than 42% of this industry, taking up the largest chunk. According to the US Department of Agriculture, as many as 50 billion burgers are consumed yearly in the US.The fast food industry has also been one to go through a multitude of significant changes in the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic upturned the way the entire industry functions. On the one hand, an estimated 5 to 7 million workers lost their jobs during the pandemic; meanwhile, demand for food delivery services grew tremendously, resulting in long-term consumer preferences towards online delivery systems due to convenience. The food delivery apps industry is predicted to reach $165 billion by 2029. The rise in snacking habits of Americans is also increasing the demand for fast food services, most of which have whole menu categories dedicated to snacking options. Lastly, the demand for food that is produced from healthier ingredients and creates a lesser carbon footprint has also increased, leading many fast food chains to reevaluate their ingredient choices. Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is the largest fast food chain in the US, with 13,520 restaurants nationwide and a revenue of over $23 billion earned in 2022. The corporation employs around 210,000 people and has showcased a revenue growth of 74.84% from 2019 to 2022. The company generated a revenue of $5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023, consistently showcasing a steady increase. The revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $5.6 billion, However, such huge revenues mean that Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) has also significantly contributed to raising greenhouse gas emissions. The corporation now targets a net-zero emission goal, to be achieved by 2050. Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is also designing restaurants that are more sustainable, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and transitioning to the use of sustainable materials for packaging and Happy Meal toys. The fast food giant also has plans to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2030. Story continuesYum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) owns Taco Bell, one of the largest Mexican cuisine chains in the US, which had an estimated revenue of $1 billion in 2022. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) also owns KFC, another division that brings in significant revenue for the company, and is famous all around the US for its fried chicken. The corporation also has Pizza Hut’s ownership, along with that of a fast-casual brand, The Habit Burger Grill. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) has delivered a record number of new restaurants in recent years, with 4,560 new units opened in 2022 alone. They have also added menu innovations on almost all their chains, roping in customers to try out new items. The corporation is employing more contemporary technology tools in order to aid an ongoing data strategy that aims to enhance consumer experiences. To encapsulate, the US fast food industry is incorporating new trends every day, with each company trying to stay ahead of the other. In that race, we have compiled a list of the 25 most popular fast foods in the US that consumers swear by. 25 Most Popular Fast Foods in the USTMON/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology: One of the most solid ways of gauging popular fast foods is to take a look at consumer opinions. For the purpose of this article, we have collected data from the social media site Reddit, where individuals have often expressed their views on the different fast food items available in the US. These 25 items have been ranked based on the number of times each was mentioned or upvoted. Based on consumer preferences, here are the 25 most popular fast foods in the US:25. Jalapeno PoppersScore: 04Research has shown that more than half of US consumers now consume three or more snacks in a day. The rising demand for snacking options has led to the popularity of items like jalapeno poppers, which can be regularly eaten in bite-sized meals. The dish as we know it has its historical origins in Central America and Mexico, but its modern version originated in the US. 24. Steak BurgerScore: 04Beef steak is an extremely popular meal option in the US, with nearly two out of every three Americans selecting it as a last meal option, as reported by Fox. The fast food version of that, the steak burger, is widely increasing in popularity as well. Experts are also considering whether steak burgers can pass hamburgers in demand. Although the possibility is a little far off into the future, it does exist. 23. Chicken Strips Score: 05In 2021, Fortune reported that the rising popularity of chicken items across US restaurant chains had led to a poultry shortage in the country. KFC, Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD), and other fast food chains like Popeyes were responsible for this increasing trend. Thus, chicken strips are one of the items on this list of most popular fast foods in the US, being eaten as appetizers all over the country. 22. Hot Dogs Score: 05According to Fortune Business Insights, New Yorkers alone spent $133.6 million on hot dogs in retail in 2020. As the working population grows, so does the demand for quick, ready-to-eat foods, leading to higher consumption of hot dogs. In order to widen their consumer base, hot dog manufacturers are not also experimenting with newer flavors, bringing more variety into the market. Due to these changing trends, hot dogs are quickly growing as one of the most popular US fast foods. 21. Milkshakes Score: 07The versatility of this breakfast drink is one of the main reasons it retains massive popularity in the US fast food industry. Milkshakes can be adjusted to meet any changing trend in the beverage industry, such as the rising demand for coffee flavors, increased purchases of alcoholic drinks, and the need for seasonal drinks. The incorporation of changing market dynamics ensures that the beverage always stays relevant.20. Mozzarella SticksScore: 07The entire US cheese sticks market was valued at $1.51 billion in 2022, and the mozzarella sticks segment dominated this market by gathering over 55% of its share. Mozzarella is also the best-loved cheese among consumers, making it a popular option for snacks and fast foods. DoorDash also reported that mozzarella sticks were the most-ordered game-day food during the 2020-2021 NFL season.  19. Sliders Score: 07White Castle, a popular US burger chain, can be credited with creating the first slider in the 1920s. In 2023, the company reached the groundbreaking number of 29 billion sliders sold since the product was first launched. Sliders have gained such popularity because they offer appetizer portions of one of the most popular fast foods in the US - burgers. 18. Egg RollsScore: 08Egg rolls have been an essential part of the menus at Chinese restaurants for quite a while, but their popularity has also managed to penetrate the American fast food industry. The Asian-inspired flavors tend to bring a comforting experience to consumers while also providing a fulfilling snack. 17. DoughnutsScore: 09Corporations like Krispy Kreme Inc (NASDAQ:DNUT) have made a huge impact on the doughnut industry in the US. The company reported a revenue of $1.53 billion in 2022, achieved by a revenue growth of 10.5%.  The changing trends in the food industry have led doughnut manufacturers to introduce gluten-free, dairy-free, whole-grain, or even keto products. The industry has performed well in terms of responding to the demands surrounding it, due to which doughnuts continue to be one of the most popular fast food items in the US.  16. PizzasScore: 10According to the Washington Post, 40% of Americans consume pizza at least once a week, making it one of the most popular fast food items in the US. Research says that the unique combination of ingredients in a pizza and its manufacturing processes make for a dish that people tend to enjoy. Domino's Pizza Inc (NYSE:DPZ) is one of the most famous pizza chains in the country.15. NachosScore: 11Nachos have gained massive popularity as appetizers and especially as movie theatre snacks. Despite their higher prices and initial skepticism, many cinema-goers need this staple snack for their entire experience. What started out as a novelty food item available at only a couple of cinemas quickly spread to fast food chains and theatres all over the country. 14. WingsScore: 12 According to the American Chicken Council, US residents consume over 1.45 billion chicken wings on just the Super Bowl weekend alone, as reported by USA Today. This fast food item has become synonymous with the sport, especially its boneless version. Experts have mentioned that boneless wings are also cheaper to produce, making them quite the staple for the football season. 13. Chicken TendersScore: 13Chicken tenders tend to yield huge profit margins owing to high markups. However, recent years have seen a steady increase in the poultry cut required for this product, as compared to other chicken cuts on the market. Moreover, poultry supplies in the market have also been going through a shortage, and because of their inability to keep up with the demand, prices are driven further upwards. These factors combine to lower the popularity of the chicken tenders, which were once much higher on the list. 12. Beef SandwichScore: 13The global beef market is projected to grow to $604.34 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 5.52%. These numbers showcase the popularity of the meat in the US as well. While steaks and burgers tend to command a higher industry segment, beef sandwiches still make it to the list of some of the most popular fast food items in the US. The specific statistics for sandwich sales by meat type are unavailable. Still, consumer trends have shown a massive preference for beef sandwiches, especially those by companies like Subway or Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). 11. Fish SandwichScore: 13The Filet-O-Fish by Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) is a simple sandwich by the corporation that has proven to be popular. As pescetarianism rises as a trend, so does the demand for a seafood-based diet. The global demand for fish is expected to almost double by 2050; hence, it gives fast food corporations an edge to incorporate seafood options as soon as possible. 10. QuesadillasScore: 16Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) are quickly rising in popularity for quesadillas. The corporation has performed well in adapting to changing trends. Just in April 2023, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) added a TikTok-inspired quesadilla to its permanent digital menu, resulting in two of its best-ever digital sales days. 9. BurritosScore: 18Vox has mentioned burritos to be a staple of Mexican-American cuisines. Fast food chains like Taco Bell by Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:TACO) offer multiple variations of the popular item and prove successful with consumers. The combined sales of burritos and quesadillas at Taco Bell jumped 9% in the last quarter of 2022, showcasing that burritos are rising in popularity as one of the most popular fast food items in the US. 8. Breakfast SandwichScore: 18All breakfast items at fast food chains are steadily rising in popularity, making a comeback after the 2020 pandemic saw a decrease in sales. This has led to many chains offering all-day breakfast options as well, with breakfast sandwiches being one of the most in-demand items. Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) entered the breakfast scene just over three years ago, and by the end of 2022, the corporation was already reporting average weekly sales of more than $3,ooo per restaurant. 7. Onion RingsScore: 19Onion rings have proven to be one of the most popular junk-food side dishes in the US, with many people choosing them in addition to their regular fast food orders. While many fast food chains in the US claim the credit for inventing this extraordinary appetizer, everyone can agree that they are an American original. 6. FriesScore: 20Fortune Business Insights valued the global French fries market at around $15 billion in 2021, with an expected market growth at a CAGR of 4.7% until 2029. While every fast food chain in the country offers some version of this staple side dish, Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) is claimed by many to have the best fries in the market. The company reformulated its fries in 2021, adding a ‘hot &amp; crispy’ innovation. Despite the rising popularity of these items, US sales of Wendy's Co (NASDAQ:WEN) in 2022 were quite disappointing due to rising inflation.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US.Suggested Articles:12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America10 Cheapest Fast Food Chains Right Now20 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants In The WorldDisclosure: None. 25 Most Popular Fast Foods in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Customers will still be able to get drink refills by asking employees. Yahoo Finance Live discusses the company’s reasons for the machines' removal.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: You know the self-service where you go and get a drink, maybe you get a couple refills here and there? That's going to be gone soon, apparently. That is what McDonald's is focusing on. And they say this is due to a few factors-- food safety, eliminating theft, and creating a more relaxed dining experience. When we talk about dining in at McDonald's, in particular, that has really slowed since the pandemic, and they're really focusing on digital, drive-through, delivery, that the three Ds as they call it.And this is coming at a time where we're talking about a lot of fast food chains. We were just talking about Popeyes yesterday, how they're trying to revolutionize their business and be more operational and be able to get things done at a quicker rate. So we'll see if this removal of the self-service drinks will do anything. Now you're going to have to go to an employee to get that done. But it's sad, like, a little bit. It's the end of an era.- I'm so naive when I was reading about this. I had no idea that soda theft was a thing. I was not aware that people-- that was a thing, that people come in with their own cups, take a coke, and leave.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I could see it like, I just want a water, get a little diet coke.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, well, and the thing about it is like, how much soda has to be stolen in order for it to make--- A difference.JULIE HYMAN: --the smallest of dents? Do you know the margins on that stuff?ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's so true.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, they're not-- what McDonald's is paying for, what comes out of that machine, is nothing.- But to your point, Allie, I wasn't surprised by it, because when the Lipton family hits McDonald's, and we do a lot because the four-year-old all about the Oreo McFlurry.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Ah, love that.- But when we-- to your point, we hit it all the time. I mean, they should send me a thank you note. That's how many Oreo McFlurries we get. But when Sid wants that flurry, we hit the drive-through.I'm never in the restaurant. And that's what's happening. Like, it's drive-through, it's pick up and go, it's the third party vendor, open an app. It is a change.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and I think just to make it more cohesive, I guess, among all the different franchises potentially, too.JULIE HYMAN: I don't remember the last time I've been to a McDonald's.- You're missing out, Julie.

303,2bed05f6-cf1e-3144-bf02-d22652f6e71e,MCD,2023-09-13,Looking for a refill? McDonald's is saying goodbye to self-serve soda in the coming years,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-refill-mcdonalds-saying-goodbye-192701610.html,1694546821,STORY,['MCD'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Say goodbye to refilling that Coke. McDonald's is getting rid of self-served soda.The Chicago-based fast food chain plans to eliminate self-service soda machines at its U.S. restaurants by 2032, McDonald's confirmed this week. It's unclear if locations outside the U.S. will follow suit.In an email to The Associated Press Tuesday, McDonald's USA said the goal of the change is to create consistency for customers and crew members across the chain's offerings — from in-person dining to online delivery and drive-thru options.The company did not specify if any additional factors — such as finances or sanitation — impacted the decision to part ways with its self-serve machines. For years, McDonald's customers have used the machines to fill and refill their beverages without additional trips to a cashier.Behind-the-counter soda machines already exist at some other fast food chains — and a handful of McDonald's locations across the country have also begun the transition. According to The State Journal-Register, which first reported on the company's plans last week, several locations in Illinois, for example, are starting to phase out self-service soda.Over recent years, analysts have also pointed to changes in consumer behavior since the COVID-19 pandemic — including an uptick in digital and online delivery sales among fast food restaurants. As a result, some chains have toyed with enhancing drive-thrus or strengthening connections with food delivery apps — from Chipotle growing its Carside pickup locations to Domino's penning a new partnership with Uber Eats.McDonald's digital sales — made up of app, delivery and kiosk purchases — accounted for almost 40% of systemwide sales for the second quarter of 2023. Revenue rose 14% to $6.5 billion for the period, the chain reported in July, and net income nearly doubled to $2.3 billion for the quarter — exceeding analysts' expectations.Some of those gains may fade a bit in the second half of the year. The price increases that have helped fuel McDonald’s sales in recent quarters will moderate as inflation comes down, Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said during July's Q2 earnings call.]"
304,7bb2a9cb-4d5a-38e2-b190-a469dd10c8d1,MCD,2023-09-13,Top 20 Most Popular Sandwiches in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-most-popular-sandwiches-132324020.html,1694525004,STORY,"['PBPB', 'MCD', 'SJM', 'CASY']","[In this article, we look at the top 20 most popular sandwiches in America. You can skip our detailed analysis on sandwich-selling companies that are on course to become powerhouses in industry and head over directly to the Top 5 Most Popular Sandwiches in America.Sandwiches are one of the most popular go-to-snacks in America, that are often had during breakfast, lunch or supper meals, and are also commonly packed and taken to work, picnics, or school. Globally, the sandwich market size was estimated to be around $20.21 billion in 2021 as noted by the Allied Market Research. It is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% to touch $39.16 billion by 2031. Experts say the upward trajectory is due to the demand for sandwiches returning to pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the expansion of marketing activities in the food industry has also been a significant trend over the last few years.Restaurant chains have also been widening their offerings, whether by adding more variety in their sandwiches, coming up with a value-enhancing menu, lowering the customer entry point, or upgrading the digital experience for customers to order food online. Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) is one company that did that and is reaping the rewards.The fast food chain, famous for its sandwiches and milkshakes, was on the verge of closing 100 corporate units in 2020 after store sales had dropped by 70%. Things were looking downhill for the company well before the pandemic struck. Sales dip 3% across 2019 and went down each quarter from Q1 2017 to Q4 2019. The management started offering combos and bundles, and reduced priced items from 55 to 18, but that still did not help in driving sales. Customer feedbacks often noted that they were not deriving value for what they were paying, and that the prices were too high.The situation began to improve after new CEO Bob Wright assumed charge in the summer of 2020. Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) revamped its app and website to enhance digital presence, rebuilt its loyalty program, and made menu changes. A smaller-sized ‘skinny’ sandwich was added to the menu in 2021 to allow customers to create pick-and-pair options at affordable rates. Since these changes, revenues have skyrocketed. Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) generated $452 million in sales in 2022, up by 19% compared to the previous year. The company has been making positive gains for the last seven successive quarters now.Story continuesImmersion Investment Partners made the following comment about Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“A stock we started purchasing in December 2022, Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) was first introduced at our 2023 Annual Investor Meeting. The best way to describe the Potbelly opportunity is that of “low-hanging fruit”. We believe that the Potbelly brand is fundamentally strong but prior management proved subpar. The entire board and c-suite has been turned over in the last two years and the new team, led by Bob Wright (former Wendy’s COO), has embarked on a mission to realign the culture and basic operating practices of the organization with a medium-term goal of right-sizing unit economics and long-term goal of growing company-owned and franchised unit count. These efforts are paying off. As of the latest business update provided in June, annualized revenue per location is tracking to $1.35mm vs. pre-COVID levels of $950,000 and restaurant-level profit margins are rebounding very quickly to ~14% (vs. 15% pre-COVID). Over the last twelve months the company has announced the signing of 96 new locations and the sale of 20 company-operated locations to new and existing franchisees. Regardless of the progress made in the business and share price appreciation, the stock continues to trade at less than 10x EBITDA vs. 15x for Potbelly’s small-cap restaurant peers.”Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY)’s hot breakfast sandwiches sales have jumped by 49% after launching ‘Toastwich’ in 2021, an item that is a key part of the breakfast menu makeover at the convenience store chain. The folded sandwich, loaded with bacon, egg, cheese, and sausages is wrapped up in dough, and offers a unique taste for the customers. Net income at Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) rose 66% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.Pre-packaged sandwiches are also growing in popularity. The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) has announced plans to build a R&amp;D facility to support the company’s Uncrustables brand that produces pre-made and packaged seal crusted sandwiches – the most popular of which are the frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The brand has seen consistent growth over the last few years, and The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) expects it to become a one-billion-dollar brand over the next five years. More than three million frozen sandwiches are made each day, generating a revenue of more than $500 million per annum.Mark Smucker, the CEO of The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) made the following remarks in the company's earnings call for Q4 2023:""In our Consumer Foods business, net sales grew 14% driven by net sales gains for Smucker’s Uncrustables frozen sandwiches, Smucker’s fruit spreads, and Jif peanut butter. The Uncrustables brand continued to deliver exceptional growth, with net sales increasing 43%, driven by 30% volume/mix growth and higher net price realization. Total Company net sales for Uncrustables, including the Away From Home business, were $185 million this quarter, and for the full fiscal year, the brand grew 34%. Uncrustables is now the #1 brand in the frozen snacks and sandwiches category. In peanut butter, Jif returned to net sales growth. After being temporarily unavailable last year, the brand has returned to #1 in the category with 39 points of dollar share in the quarter. With increased marketing and other demand driving activities, we anticipate strong double-digit net sales growth in fiscal 2024. In addition to the strong performance for our U.S. Retail businesses, momentum continued in our Away From Home business as comparable net sales increased 25%, driven by higher net price realization and double- digit volume/mix growth.""Top 20 Most Popular Sandwiches in AmericaLet’s now head over to the list of the most popular sandwiches in America.MethodologyWe have ranked the top 20 most popular sandwiches in America using consensus methodology, using three sources: YouGov's 2019 survey that had a sample size of over 1,200 respondents telling about their favorite sandwich; Taste Atlas' 2023 list of 50 Most Popular American sandwiches that is based on audience ratings; and lastly we also referred to Reddit to see what Americans prefer to get a sense of their choice of sandwich.

Companies are prioritizing investments in automation and broader enabling technologies, such as GRC solutions, as well as advanced technology tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to support SOX compliance activities. These technologies help counteract pressure from the PCAOB and external auditors to increase scope and procedures. The SEC's recently adopted rules related to cybersecurity disclosures and highly anticipated climate disclosure rules only increase the potential for expanded scope.Protiviti logo. (PRNewsFoto/Protiviti) (PRNewsfoto/Protiviti)Companies prioritizing automation as a key tool to moderate rising cost pressures are experiencing increased efficiency, effectiveness and a decrease in business and operational costs. Yet when faced with automation opportunities, many audit and finance leaders cite lack of time to explore automation and enabling technologies due to other priorities (39%), lack of effort to implement, train, govern and maintain the new systems (34%), and lack funding and/or executive buy-in (31%).With Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) now a top technological consideration for business, organizations need to focus on areas including data governance, change management and upskilling when pursuing these new technologies. Otherwise, they will struggle to reap the benefits. The increase in hours spent on SOX compliance during the most recent fiscal year underscores the need to create and implement sustainable change through technology tools and automation.Story continues""The investment in technology and automation has the potential to deliver strong ROI – helping to streamline routine tasks, increase the quality and efficiency of communications, enhance the effectiveness of the overall program and allow for a more optimal allocation of resources,"" said Andrew Struthers-Kennedy, a Protiviti managing director and global leader of the firm's Internal Audit and Financial Advisory practice. ""There is significant untapped potential through the implementation of automation, enabling technologies and increasingly GenAI and LLMs.""Cybersecurity &amp; ESG Disclosures Driving Increased Regulatory ScrutinyTechnology and automation have helped companies manage an increasing volume of disclosure requirements from the SEC. The SEC's recently adopted rules around cybersecurity disclosures highlight the broader changing landscape of non-financial data reporting for SOX compliance and how organizations are preparing for it.""The SEC rule will inherently increase disclosures related to cybersecurity risk management, governance and material incidents. With a quickly evolving cyber threat landscape and an increasing vulnerability footprint for many organization, cyber risk will remain poised for having a material impact on financial reporting and SOX compliance,"" added Struthers-Kennedy.When looking at ESG more closely, the survey found that 37% of organizations are already disclosing ESG metrics, however, only 16% have added additional controls to address the SEC's proposed climate change requirements, a number expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years.The Protiviti report, titled ""The Evolution of SOX: Tech Adoption and Cost Focus Amid Business Changes, Cyber and ESG Mandates,"" is based on a survey of more than 560 audit and finance leaders, representing a wide range of industries. The survey was conducted with support from AuditBoard, a leading cloud-based audit, risk, IT security, and ESG management platform, in April and May of 2023.Survey Resources AvailableThe annual Protiviti SOX Compliance Survey benchmarks compliance costs, hours, processes and improvements, including how these areas are affected by current business conditions.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published a new white paper analyzing data about spending increases and decreases in retirement years. According to T. Rowe Price's analysis, for households with less than $150,000 in annual income, spending volatility is largely driven by nondiscretionary expenses[1]. Specifically, the paper finds that among them, home-related expenses are the largest contributor to spending volatility during retirement, and they are five times more likely to drive spending volatility than health-related expenses. Home-related expenses accounted for 25.1% of the variance in spending, while health-care expenses accounted for 5.3%.[2]Further, despite households experiencing an average annual spending decline of approximately two percent during retirement, the spending decreases in retirement are typically not uniform, with retirees experiencing meaningful ups and downs over time rather than a continuous decline.Additional key insights from the data analysis include:One in every two retirees experienced an annual spending increase of up to 25% at some point during retirement; one in four households experienced a 25-50% spending increase; and over one in five households experienced spending increases between 50-100%.[3] For retirees with annual incomes levels above $150,000, spending volatility was largely due to changes in discretionary spending.[4]Although the drivers of spending volatility can vary with household income levels, overall spending volatility was not correlated with investable assets or household income, suggesting that retirees of any level of investable assets or income could face a high level of fluctuation in spending.In addition to the analysis, the white paper provides insights on managing and preparing for potential spending volatility, specifically noting the importance of generating cash flows and implementing retirement income solutions that incorporate liquidity and growth opportunities. In the case of home expenses, the paper also suggests that advisors can help retirees by recommending strategies that minimize unexpected home expenses in retirement, like completing extensive repairs before retiring or right-sizing to a newer home with fewer repair needs.Story continues""The basic financial objectives of generating income for day-to-day expenses, maintaining liquidity, and growing assets remain true both before and during retirement,"" said Sudipto Banerjee, Ph.D., vice president, retirement thought leadership. ""By planning for and being prepared to adjust to volatility in spending, retirees can increase their odds of success in retirement. And the retirement industry can play a key role in assisting with solutions that meet all these objectives and help retirees transition from the accumulation phase to the drawdown phase.""This study analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study and its supplement, the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan[i]. The sample used in this study tracked a nationally representative set of 1,306 retired households over the 14-year span between 2005 and 2019. More details from T.

The contract will last five years and ""total cost growth"" will be 3.3%. UPS CFO Brian Newman sits down with Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman and Brad Smith to discuss the details of the agreement between UPS and it's workers. Some of these new benefits include an increase in wages, improved working conditions, and the use of tech to increase productivity.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- After months of negotiations, UPS and the Teamsters Union reached a five-year labor deal in July. Now, we've got a sense of the financial implications of the agreement. The company says the deal raises wages and benefits by over 3% per year with 46% of wage increases coming the first year.UPS employs about 340,000 Teamster members, making it the largest single employer of the Union. Brian Newman, chief financial officer of UPS, joins us now to tell us more about what this new contract means. Great to have you here with us. We've also got Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman.Look, Brian, we got a lot to discuss here. And-- and it's particularly interesting as we were listening in to the announcement and hearing you highlight some of the details there. You've got kind of all in costs here. It's pay plus benefits.You've got new AC installs for vehicles here. So kind of take us through some of the highlights just very briefly.BRIAN NEWMAN: Yeah, Brad and Julie, it's good to be with you this morning. Thanks very much. Look, we're-- we're actually very pleased with the contract. Now that it's been fully ratified, we can come out and talk about it, which-- which we've wanted to do for some time.It's a five-year agreement. The total cost growth or inflation will be 3.3%. We're actually giving back things we were already investing in like vehicles AC, heat for heat reduction through some hydration programs, et cetera.So we're investing in our facilities. We're investing in our people. But we actually think, Brad and Julie, that having the best workforce in the industry will deliver that service that we're known for, and ultimately that delivers for our customers. And so a 3.3% inflation rate over the next five years, you just benchmark that versus a 4 plus percent five-year treasury, that's a pretty good rate.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: So give us a little more color about how that money is gonna be spent and at what cadence, because you all have described this as sort of a barbell, right, with 46% of the cost coming in the first year. What's the other end of that barbell in the last year then? And-- and how is it-- is that paid out in the form of bonuses? What is that gonna look like?BRIAN NEWMAN: So-- so the-- the barbell is a good optical piece. I think, Julie, the tough part is the front end of the barbell. I'm less worried about the back end of the barbell. I'll tell you why in a minute.But the front end over the next 12 months, having nearly half, 46% of the inflation hit in that part, what it does is it sets you up for years 2, 3, and 4. That's a number that 3.3%, that's a gross number, does not include pricing, does not include productivity. So it gives us the ability to drive pricing and productivity to expand margins, throw off cash, et cetera.By year 5, there's another step-up. But the reason I'm not as worried about that is we have-- we've basically maintained the technology clause in the contract that allows us to-- to deploy and leverage technology to become more efficient and drive productivity. So the investments we'll be making over the next 3, 4 years will be really focused on how does UPS become more efficient? And that's in-- in technology, like, RFID, digital capability, et cetera. But that-- that basically drives productivity.BRAD SMITH: Perhaps something that investors will be a-- a little bit more excited about here is that this kind of locks in or at least gives them a benchmark for what labor costs will look like for-- for the next five years. But something on the other side here for-- for drivers if we consider how this also changes their existing assignments, the scheduling, what does that look like as part of this negotiation and part of the dealing that's essentially come to what you described as a win-win agreement?BRIAN NEWMAN: Yeah, it really, Brad. It is a win-win agreement. I was-- I was in New York with a lot of our employees and drivers a couple of weeks ago as we celebrated Founder's Day. I'm out here on the West Coast this morning with-- with our employees as well.The drivers will be making $170,000 at the end of this contract. That's a fantastic wage, and it basically locks in that service and-- and-- and reliability that-- that our customers rely on for UPS. So I think we have the best employees.Ultimately, by-- by-- by giving them the pay they deserve, and-- and-- and it's a fair-- fair trade, we've also employed flexibility. So our part timers can now-- during the sea-- seasonal holiday during peak, they can come on as part time seasonal drivers. And so we're leveraging the best of both worlds, take the part timers who UPS, give them the flexibility to drive as part time sea-- or full time seasonal drivers. That's a really positive spin. So flexibility and getting the best labor out there will deliver the service.JULIE HYMAN: And-- and, Brian, just to be clear, that 170,000 is salary and benefits. That's not like the base salary. So just to-- for-- for clarity's sake there.BRIAN NEWMAN: All angel.JULIE HYMAN: All of this said, investors are not entirely convinced, I think safe to say, at least if you look at the stock price and how it has done over the course of these negotiations but not even over the course of negotiations since they have been concluded and even today as you gave more details on these costs over the next few years. What are investors missing here? They're seeing these big numbers and maybe a little spooked.BRIAN NEWMAN: Yeah, Julie, I think there's a-- a bit of a hangover. Coming out of the contract negotiation, we were waiting for full ratification. Now that we're out there and-- and basically have shared the 3.3%, if-- if the certainty is great I think for investors. So over the long term, the next five years, they know what our biggest input costs will-- will grow.I think the challenge becomes in the short term, that 46% of the contract inflation happens in the first 12 months. There's a bit of an overhang short term. And I think investors are waiting to see the volume pull through. We have a $7 billion pipeline of sales out there, and now it's our job since last week the contract fully ratified.Now we have to pull those sales through, show them the volume, and we've already proven that we can-- we can generate a lot of productivity in the business. So I-- I like the trade going forward. I think the investors are just cautious with the short-term productivity, but I think certainly years 2, 3, and 4, they bode well for the stock.BRAD SMITH: What amount of that $7 billion pipeline do you believe could come through by the holiday season, by or before the holiday season, which is a-- a peak time, we know, for logistics operations?BRIAN NEWMAN: Well, it's-- the cardboard is going on the truck this week, Brad, so-- so it's-- it's happening. As I said, as a-- as a benchmark, we would like December of this year to get back to flat versus prior year. We exited the last quarter down 12% in the month of June. So that down 12 will-- will-- will transition to flat over the course of the back half of the year. So we're very focused on it, but-- but the sales team, the US operations, they're-- they're both winning back, and they're pulling through that sales pipeline, big focus right now.JULIE HYMAN: Brian, forgive me for a small detour here, but I wanna address some news that came out this morning from one of your competitors, a newer competitor, that is, Amazon that is launching a new supply chain sort of end to end product for sellers. And again, forgive me. I'm not sure if it directly competes with something that UPS offers. So what-- what can you tell us about this and-- and the sort of competitive risk here?BRIAN NEWMAN: So Amazon is-- is one of our biggest partners. And-- and we-- we have a mutually beneficial agreement or arrangement that-- that we're pleased with. At the end of the day, we have a path with-- with Amazon from a volume perspective to try and glide the volume down.We've talked about that publicly. And-- and so as we do that, we focus on the packages that make the most sense to be in the UPS system, and Amazon's focused on their volume. We're not Amazon supply chain in any way, shape, or form. We're a part of their supply chain, which is particularly valuable in-- in the peak season when the volume goes up significantly and-- and also through elements like returns that they leverage UPS for.BRAD SMITH: Brian, thanks so much for taking the time to help break down some of the components of this deal. And we look forward to hearing much more about where this is actually showing up in the financials as well. Brian Newman, chief financial officer of UPS, and Yahoo Finance's own Julie Hyman joining us.BRIAN NEWMAN: Thanks, Brad. Thanks, Julie.]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 53% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Occidental Petroleum already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Occidental Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 25%. Dodge &amp; Cox is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 6.8% of the company stock.Story continuesTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Occidental Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$155m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Occidental Petroleum. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 25% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 is a bit unpleasant)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

The oil driller’s carbon-removal subsidiary, 1PointFive, is currently building a massive plant in West Texas that is designed to pull carbon from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture.Amazon, which aims to eliminate its carbon emissions by 2040, says it will meet that goal primarily through operational changes like relying on solar power and electric vehicles. The company will also use purchased credits to offset the portion of its greenhouse gas emissions that it isn’t able to wipe out. In recent years, Amazon has spent millions on reforestation and forest preservation projects around the world. Trees absorb carbon as they grow.Amazon in July said it emitted 71.27 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, down 0.4% from the prior year as its growth slowed and renewable energy projects came online. The company's emissions are up by about 40% since Amazon set its net zero target in 2019.Tuesday’s announcement marks Amazon’s first investment in technological solutions designed to extract carbon from the air. Amazon didn’t disclose how much it would pay per ton of carbon removed as part of the Oxy deal, which deepens an existing corporate partnership. In July, Oxy made Amazon Web Services its “preferred cloud provider,” saying it would rely on the cloud unit for its core production systems and analytics tools, as well as technology for its direct air capture plants.Story continuesSuch partnerships between cloud giants and oil drillers are controversial among environmental activists and some Big Tech employees who see them as extending a lifeline to fossil fuel companies. AWS and some rivals say their cloud services can help customers operate more efficiently and meet their own climate goals.Oxy also plans to pump CO2 into existing oil wells to force more to the surface — a process it claims will produce emissions-free crude oil. The carbon removal services Amazon acquires from Oxy will be stored in saline aquifers, not used to extract oil, Jamey Mulligan, Amazon's head of carbon neutralization, said in a statement. “Direct air capture will be critical to combat global climate change, and the science tells us we have a narrow window to massively scale the technology,” he said. “We will work across industries and sectors that have existing expertise and assets that can help us accelerate a net-zero carbon future.”Companies including All Nippon Airways, Airbus and Shopify have announced purchases of carbon removal credits from 1PointFive.Separately, Amazon said it would invest in CarbonCapture Inc., a company that builds direct air capture systems. As part of the deal, Amazon is acquiring the right to up to 100,000 metric tons of carbon credits from CarbonCapture, which it subsequently will allocate among its own businesses, or make available to its partners, suppliers and customers.The world will need to remove billions of tons of CO2 annually by mid-century to avert the worst impacts of climate change. The carbon removal industry remains nascent, though, and only pulls a few thousand tons of carbon from the atmosphere annually. A number of corporations have purchased services in an effort to expand the market, and the federal government recently announced $1.2 billion in investments for so-called DAC hubs to help the technology mature faster. That includes an award for Oxy to build another Texas plant where it will solely store CO2.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Sam Bankman-Fried’s Elite Parents Enabled His Crypto EmpireADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutChina’s Boom Is Over, But It’s Not a BustEveryone’s Worrying About China, But the Real Pain Is Coming From the FedGoodbye, California.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $49.5 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide technical, management and process support to maintain the software for all H-60 aircraft variants.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy as well as the governments of Australia, Denmark, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Greece and Norway.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Owego, NY.Importance of H-60 HelicoptersLockheed’s H-60 fleet of Black Hawk multirole helicopters serves the U.S. military and the armed forces of 34 other countries worldwide as a tough, reliable utility helicopter. The modern variant of this utility aircraft has lately taken on a new mission set as an armed helicopter to provide fire suppression when supporting ground troops as well as armed escort.With digital avionics, powerful GE engines, high strength airframe structures and composite wide chord rotor blades, today’s BLACK HAWK platform has better survivability and situational awareness, and can fly higher and carry more than its predecessors.More than 4,000 BLACK HAWK aircraft of all types are in service worldwide today. The U.S. Army is the largest operator with 2,135 H-60 designated aircraft.Growth ProspectsIn recent times, U.S. military helicopters have gained prominence and significant traction due to advancements and integration of new tactical, logistical and other important features. Some of these developments can be attributed to Lockheed paving the way for securing valuable helicopter-related contracts of late. The recent contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, rising geopolitical and cross border conflicts prevalent across the globe have forced nations to increase their defense spending toward procuring new aircraft and helicopters to enhance their aerial capabilities. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the military rotorcraft market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2023-2028 period.Story continuesThis should significantly boost Lockheed as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military helicopter market with its portfolio containing programs like e Black Hawk, Seahawk and CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters.Opportunities for PeersOther defense companies that may enjoy the perks of the expanding military rotorcraft market are as follows:Boeing BA: The company’s military rotorcraft is renowned worldwide for its leading-edge, ready and relevant solutions that deliver proven capabilities.

Y3000, which began hitting store shelves this month, combined ""human intelligence and AI together for an uplifting expression of what Coca‑Cola believes tomorrow will bring,” the company said in a statement.Unlike many earlier mystery flavors, Y3000 has zero sugar. That leans into the growing trend of consumers opting for healthier beverages.Exactly how much AI played a role in the beverage’s creation was not specified. Given how carefully Coke guards its recipe and reputation, it’s more likely AI just offered some possible flavor additives, but that’s not stopping the company from touting its use.“After leaning into Augmented Reality last year, we’re embracing the power of AI and continuing to build our company’s capabilities in this exciting space,” said Oana Vlad, Senior Director, Global Strategy, The Coca‑Cola Company.Like any of the company’s mystery flavors, traditional Coke flavors are dominant, but with hints of something else. The surprise element have resonated with TikTokers and younger consumers.This time around, though, the reaction is mixed, at best. Some tasters enjoyed it, but said they would have preferred a version that’s not zero-sugar, while another Reddit user described it as “coke mixed with strawberry yogurt flavored. Terrible Terrible Terrible.”To keep the brand relevant, Coke has been rolling out a number of new flavors in recent years. Just three months ago, it targeted gamers with Coca-Cola Ultimate, made in partnership with the creator of League of Legends. (Like Y3000, it kept the flavor a secret until it hit shelves.) Other “mystery flavors” have included Starlight (which the company says was inspired by space), Dreamworld and Byte.In other instances, it’s announcing the new flavors as part of the rollout, such as 2019’s Orange Vanilla Coke and Cinnamon Coca-Cola, which was a seasonal drink that year.Story continuesThe strategy seems to be working.

The tour will help identify and raise awareness of risk factors that may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and a family history of kidney failure.The tour will visit nearly 50 communities across the United States from September 18 through November 20, providing opportunities for individuals to take control of their kidney health.""Despite the severity of kidney disease, an estimated 50% of patients who are diagnosed with kidney failure aren't fully prepared for a diagnosis, a staggering number that DaVita is committed to reducing, in part through early detection and prevention efforts,"" said Dr. Jeff Giullian, Chief Medical Officer at DaVita. ""The DaVita Health Tour is designed to address this gap, empowering patients with critical knowledge about their kidney health through a free and simple screening and educational resources that participants can use in partnership with a care provider.

SRDX scaled a new 52-week high of $39.41 on Sep 11, before closing the session slightly lower at $38.25.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 21.4% against the 3.9% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.5% growth in the said time frame.The company’s expected growth rate of 76.8% for fiscal 2023 compares with the industry’s growth projection of 15.6%. Surmodics’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 71.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSurmodics is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D). The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and prospects in the thrombectomy business are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversConsistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, R&amp;D expenses reflected continued investment in medical device product development, including in Surmodics’ Pounce thrombectomy and Sublime radial access product platforms and costs associated with its SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB).Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. On the third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call in August, Surmodics’ management stated that sales of its Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy and Sublime Radial products were an important contributor to the 38% medical device business product sales growth achieved in the quarter.Story continuesIn June, Surmodics received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil DCB.Strong Q3 Results: Surmodics registered a solid uptick in the overall top and bottom lines in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company recorded robust revenues from its Medical Device segment and primary sources. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.DownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The collaboration is set to provide the Mastercard Travel and Expenses (T&amp;E) cardholders across the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (EEMEA) region access to Crisis24’s efficient risk management platform.The travel risk management solution is equipped with multiple benefits and is the first-of-its-kind solution to be offered to MA’s commercial card customers across the region. The easy-to-use platform can be availed online or through app and enables companies to gain knowledge about the global risk landscape.It also equips firms to organize pre-emptive risk assessments, devise a corporate security strategy and set up alert protocols for faster conveyance of vital information to ensure safe business travel of an organization’s workforce.Subsequently, in case of an unforeseen crisis, the solution imparts firms the strength to get updates about its employees’ location, alerts and mitigation suggestions.  Additionally, it can be easily configured into the policies of any organization.The recent move reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to equip corporates in taking informed decisions, efficiently manage risks and bring about enhanced experience for its employees traveling for business purposes, irrespective of domestic or international travel. The proprietary platform of Crisis24 seems to be the apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor since it integrates AI with an expert squad of intelligence analysts for monitoring and providing data on a varied array of risks across the world. Meanwhile, the collaboration represents an initiative of Mastercard in bolstering its suite of T&amp;E offerings. The tech giant’s T&amp;E solutions provide control, safety and transparency across multiple touchpoints of the payment experience, but a solution assuring the safety of an organization’s employees will remain a lucrative addition.

We have also covered an in depth analysis of the beauty industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Countries with the Most Attractive People. How is the Global Beauty Market Doing Today?In 2022, the beauty industry showed remarkable resilience as it generated a revenue of over $430 billion despite global economic uncertainties. The beauty industry which comprises skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare, has lured various stakeholders, from top-tier financiers to A-list celebrities. This explains why the beauty industry is projected to reach a value of $580 billion by 2027, with a projected annual growth rate of 6 percent. It must also be noted that such growth outpaces several other consumer markets like apparel, footwear, eyewear, pet care, and food and beverages.In 2023, the evolution in beauty extends beyond monetary gains as growth factors are driven by shifting consumer dynamics, particularly among younger generations. These consumers are redefining beauty with evolving concepts of sustainability, influencers’ opinions, and the importance of self-care. In fact, 42 percent of consumers across key markets express enthusiasm for trying new brands which also drives a trend towards dynamic, trend-oriented consumer behavior. E-commerce in the beauty sector has also thrived, quadrupling between 2015 and 2022, with its share exceeding 20 percent. While e-commerce is poised to remain the fastest-growing industry at 12 percent growth rate annually between 2022 and 2027, traditional channels like specialty retail and drugstores, are expected to rebound post-pandemic, driven by consumers' desire for in-store product trials. Artificial Intelligence in the Beauty IndustryThe beauty industry is undergoing a remarkable transformation as artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse are converging. Brands have been integrating AI-driven technologies to offer virtual makeup try-ons, personalized skincare recommendations, and immersive experiences. AI's role in analyzing user preferences and providing tailored product suggestions is also enhancing customer engagement.Story continuesIt is worth mentioning how the Estée Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) is pioneering the use of AI and augmented reality (AR) to make cosmetics more accessible for visually impaired individuals. Their Voice-enabled Makeup Assistant (VMA) leverages the existing Augmented Reality Immersive Application (ARIA) platform and incorporates AI and machine learning algorithms. VMA assists users in creating their desired makeup look through real-time video scanning and provides voice guidance and feedback. However, its not looking good for the company as of recent. Estée Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) reported its Q2 2023 results which revealed a 17% decline in net sales amounting to $4.62 billion, down from $5.54 billion for the same period in the previous year. Gross profit for the second quarter also decreased to $3.40 billion. For the first half of 2023, Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)’s net sales were $8.55 billion and marked a 14% decrease compared to $9.93 billion for the first half of the previous year. Aristotle Atlantic Partners made the following comment about the Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Estee Lauder shares were weak during the second quarter, following an inline earnings report where Estee again pushed out the timing of a recovery in their travel retail business due to sluggish travel trends in China and an inventory overhand in that end market. Estee reduced fiscal 2023 earnings guidance again and pushed the timing of the recovery toward the end of this calendar year. Outside of travel retail, growth was solid in the Americas, Europe, APAC, Emerging Markets and China.”Sustainability is Here to StaySustainability is driven by consumers' growing awareness of their environmental impact. From fragrances to self-tanners, beauty brands are gradually adopting refillable packaging and observing eco-friendly practices in production.For example, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) has achieved a huge milestone in sustainability by launching Gucci's Eau de Parfum, ""Where My Heart Beats,"" as the world's first fragrance produced using 100% carbon-captured alcohol. This perfume is essentially the result of Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY)’s partnership with LanzaTech, which captures carbon emissions from industry and converts them into high-quality alcohol for fragrance production. By using this technology, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) is reducing its carbon footprint and environmental impact and hence, contributing to a more sustainable beauty industry. Moving on to its financial performance, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) has reported strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 which ended on March 31, 2023. Q3 sales surged by 9% despite a 3% negative impact from exiting the Russia business, with core LFL sales soaring by an impressive 15%. The company's Prestige revenues in Q3 also witnessed a stable 10% growth rate as reported and a staggering 16% LFL growth which was driven by surging demand for prestige fragrances and improved service levels. The Rise of Gender Equality in the Beauty IndustryThe beauty industry is undergoing a noteworthy transformation with a growing trend towards both gender equality and gender neutrality. Historically, skincare and beauty products were heavily gendered, but an increasingly gender-fluid generation of consumers is challenging this long-standing norm. Both indie and global brands are embracing inclusivity in their product development and marketing strategies. To exemplify, L'Oréal S.A (OTC:LRLCY) has been consistently recognized for gender equality by the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for six consecutive years. The company prioritizes creating an inclusive and equal work environment across different areas like leadership representation, equal pay, anti-sexual harassment policies which also fosters an inclusive culture. It is worth mentioning that women at L'Oréal S.A (OTC:LRLCY) comprise 43% of the total workforce, with strong representation at the managerial and executive levels. L'Oréal S.A (OTC:LRLCY) also actively collaborates with external organizations to assess and enhance its gender equality policies.50 Countries with the Most Attractive PeoplePhoto by Ball Park Brand on UnsplashMethodologyThe selection of the top 50 countries with the most attractive people was determined after analyzing the stats for the 1000 most followed people on Instagram.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions.

While some investors will dismiss investing in the sector as reckless speculation, Warren Buffett is buying the sector. That’s not the only reason there may be a bullish setup for the best homebuilder stocks.  Earlier this summer Deutsche Bank described the housing market in the United States as underbuilt. One reason for this is the “great relocation” that continues to change the housing landscape. Single- and multi-family homes can’t get built fast enough in many of the hottest areas of the country.  Another reason is that the higher interest rates are keeping many existing homeowners in place. That puts homebuilders in a great position to fill the gap. If interest rates stay higher for longer, it will create a backlog that won’t be filled anytime soon. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe best news is that many of the best homebuilder stocks are undervalued. I many cases, these stocks create shareholder equity through reliable dividends and share repurchases.  D.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is one of the three stocks that Buffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought this summer. Of those three, DHI stock may be the most undervalued. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 8.6 times. It also is coming off an earnings report where it beat on the top and bottom lines. Revenue was also higher year-over-year.  One feature that makes D.R. Horton one of the best homebuilder stocks is the company’s ability to turn homes quickly. This matters because homebuilders usually rely on borrowed money to finance their builds. Having the ability to turn homes quickly can keep their debt level manageable in a higher-for-longer interest rate environment.  Analysts project D.R. Horton’s earnings to grow earnings by more than 5% in the next 12 months.

One of Lennar’s key markets is Florida, which is still one of the fastest growing sectors of the homebuilding sector.  LEN stock is down from its all-time high which it reached in mid-July. That was after the company posted a double beat in its second quarter earnings report. Many analysts raised their price targets since that report. However, that may not be reflected in the company’s stock price which is down 7.6% in the last month. Not surprisingly, short interest is up more than 10% in that time.  However, Lennar stock is still an attractive buy that is trading at 9.5x forward earnings. It also pays a dividend with an attractive 1.3% yield and a track record of at least five consecutive years of dividend growth which puts it among the best among Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) 500 stocks.  PulteGroup (PHM) the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) was not one of the homebuilder stocks bought by Warren Buffett. However, it still makes this list of the best homebuilder stocks. The company is the third largest builder with a network that covers many of the hottest sectors in the country including Florida and Texas. Also, approximately 50% of the company’s homes built in 2022 closed at a price point below $500,000. At a time when the price of an average home continues to move higher, Pulte continues to build homes that are in the sweet spot for many prospective buyers.  Of the three stocks on this list, PulteGroup has the smallest forecasted earnings growth at just 0.8%. However, that isn’t keeping analysts away. The stock has an average price target of $98.38 which is 26% above the current price. A total of 14 out of 17 analysts give PHM stock a “Buy” or “Strong Buy” rating.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

MRC has failed to impress investors with its recent operational performance due to rising operating costs, supply chain constraints and foreign currency headwinds. These factors are likely to impede the company’s earnings in the quarters ahead.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue taking a toll on the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) firm.Increasing Costs and Expenses: MRC Global has been dealing with the adverse impacts of high cost of sales (due to raw material cost inflation). In the first six months of 2023, the cost of sales increased 7.6% year over year. Selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 11.1% in the same period due to higher employee-related costs and associated benefit costs. Escalating costs pose a threat to MRC’s bottom line. Also, difficulties in securing drilling permits and the regulatory framework, which are unfavorable for the oil and gas industry, are affecting the company’s PTI business.Supply Chain Constraint: While the situation has improved, supply chain disruptions remain a major challenge for MRC Global. The company is facing supply chain constraints for component parts, particularly valves and meters. Labor constraints, arising from the post-pandemic improvement of employment rates and increased competition among companies to attract and retain employees, are also worrisome for the company in the quarters ahead.Forex Woes: Given its widespread presence in international markets, MRC Global is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. In second-quarter 2023, the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted Canada’s sales by $2 million. Foreign exchange headwinds adversely impacted International sales by $3 million.Southbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRC’s 2023 earnings has been revised 11.1% downward.MRC Global Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks For Dividend Growth. Tech stocks have been the center of attention in the market this year, while dividend stocks have fallen behind. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for over 25 consecutive years, returned 2.93% so far this year, significantly underperforming the broader market, which delivered a  17.35% return to shareholders year-to-date.However, companies worldwide have continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders, which indicates that they have sustainable earnings. According to a recent report by Janus Henderson, global dividends reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2023 due to significant contributions from major banks, which were responsible for half of the overall growth. During the quarter, global dividend payments increased by 4.9% to a total of $568.1 billion. The report also mentioned that 88% of the companies worldwide increased their dividends or held them steady in Q2. Dividends distributed by U.S. companies increased by a modest 2.6% to reach $148 billion, with healthcare and real estate companies contributing to this growth.When considering a dividend investing strategy, dividend growth stocks become top choices for investors. One reason for this inclination is that dividend growth stocks provide a consistent stream of income to shareholders. Secondly, companies with a history of increasing dividends often have strong financials and stable operations. During market downturns or economic challenges, these stocks may show more resilience, providing a degree of protection for your portfolio. Moreover, dividend growth can outpace inflation, as we have described in detail in our article, 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.Story continuesAnalysts strongly recommend investing in dividend stocks to weather severe economic conditions. Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, spoke with Barron’s about dividend growth stocks and their importance in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Those stocks will do well—and really show their stripes and outperform—in an environment where we start to price in a slowdown and certainly price in the Fed starting to cut rates.”She further said that dividend aristocrats and the like can provide good value for portfolios with a long-term investment horizon. For example, companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends for decades, which highlights their sound financial health.

363,3b2bdb17-9ff2-3a7a-bb08-63f5053b584b,UNP,2023-09-13,Union Pacific's new CEO won't forego cuts as he works to improve safety and service at the railroad,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacifics-ceo-wont-forego-200852909.html,1694549332,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific's new CEO, who came into the job last month with a reputation for cost-cutting, says he won't shy away from that but no one should expect the kind of sweeping changes he made when he first oversaw the railroad's operations a few years ago.Jim Vena told investors Tuesday in some of his first public comments since he became CEO Aug. 14 that he's focused on improving safety and service at the railroad. While he's willing to invest in that, mostly he wants to make sure Union Pacific's day-to-day operations are steadily improving.“When you’re operating the railroad, you don’t make one big mistake normally and you cause yourself to impact the system and you slow down and then you can’t provide the service,” Vena said. “What happens is you make a lot of small mistakes, and if you make small mistakes, they come back all of a sudden and add up and you wake up one day and you go, Wow! So that’s what I want to make sure that we’re on top of.”Initially, that means Vena is looking closely over the shoulder of Union Pacific's chief operating officer, the job that Vena previously held at the railroad in 2019 and 2020. He's also working to speed up decision making at the railroad to help make Union Pacific more responsive to customers. Vena was hired after a hedge fund that was disappointed in the results under previous CEO Lance Fritz put pressure on UP.Vena said he's not changing from the lean operating principles he honed during four decades at Canadian National railroad, so more cuts are likely coming. But he said they won't be as drastic as in his first tenure because Union Pacific already made most of the big moves when it first adopted the “precision scheduled railroading” model and slashed thousands of jobs and shut down a number of railyards across its 23-state network in the West.Going forward, Union Pacific will also be focused on attracting new business and boosting rates to cover higher costs like the raises and sick leave the railroad agreed to give workers over the past year to address some of their quality-of-life concerns. Both those things will also help the bottom line.Story continues“I promise you this: we’re going to be the best,” Vena said. “We’re going to have the best margins. We’re going to have the best service, and we’re going to have the best safety record. And if we do that, customers will want to come with us.”But the current weak consumer demand amid the uncertain economy and inflation has translated into a 3% drop in volume so far in the third quarter, even though most industrial shipments have remained steady. That will put pressure on Union Pacific’s profits.Vena's comments about continuing to improve safety will likely be welcomed by the head of the Federal Railroad Administration who took the railroad to task in a letter last week detailing an alarming number of defects found by inspectors this summer on freight cars and locomotives in use at Union Pacific's largest railyard.After Vena spoke with FRA Administrator Amit Bose on the phone Monday, he wrote a letter stressing Union Pacific's commitment to addressing the concerns and making any needed changes or repairs.Railroad safety has been in the spotlight this year ever since a Norfolk Southern train derailed and caught fire in eastern Ohio back in February. That crash prompted temporary evacuations, calls for reforms and months of cleanup that still isn't complete. It also left the people who live near East Palestine with many lingering health worries.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Union Pacific wants to know what safety defects federal inspectors say they found when conducting focused inspections last month at the Class I railroad’s rail yard in North Platte, Nebraska.UP CEO Jim Vena said in a letter Monday to Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, that the railroad “will never compromise on the safety of our employees. We take the concerns raised very seriously and are confident we have the people and practices in place to responsibly maintain our locomotives and car fleets.”Bose had sent a letter to UP (NYSE: UNP) leadership on Friday admonishing the rail carrier for numerous defects he said were found during the inspections of UP’s locomotive and fleet maintenance program in July and August. Bose said he had “serious concern[s]” about how UP handles rail safety, pointing out that “the compliance of the rolling stock (freight cars and locomotives) on the UP network is poor and UP was unwilling or unable to take steps to improve the condition of their equipment.”Bose’s letter also questioned whether those defects were related to the recent furloughs of 94 craft employees.Copies of both letters were sent to Surface Transportation Board Chairman Marty Oberman.Vena pressed the FRA for more details about its findings beyond what was mentioned in Bose’s letter.“Typically, inspections by the FRA include a focused audit close out with clear findings and action steps, as well as a meeting to discuss any findings and mitigation approaches. Our team has not received an audit close out, which will help us more quickly address the issues raised,” he said.Vena asked the FRA to clarify what defects were found on the locomotives as well as the magnitude of defects, saying that defects can range from something as minor as an amnesty lock on a bathroom door to something that would have a higher impact, such as a high flange wheel. He also asserted that the FRA investigation involved only 10% of the locomoives in North Platte and 1% of UP’s overall fleet.Story continuesVena defended UP’s actions when FRA inspectors sought to inspect certain areas at the North Platte yard, saying that the perceived resistance was so the railroad could keep inspectors safe as well as ensure that operations would keep running as inspections were occurring.“When unscheduled audits occur in railyards, it is standard procedure to work with FRA inspectors to ensure the location of the inspections doesn’t cause safety risks for inspectors or employees, or create service interruptions for our customers,” Vena said.“It is very common at a location like North Platte to ask the inspection team to go to a different part of the yard if inspections are becoming impactful to service or placing the inspectors at risk,” he continued.Vena reiterated that the furloughs of craft employees across UP’s system were the result of lower business volumes, which translates into putting more equipment into storage.“There is no correlation between recent furloughs and Union Pacific’s ability to address mechanical repairs. … Mechanical employee-to-car and locomotive ratios are in line with our own long-term trend, as well as those across the industry,” he said.Vena indicated that UP and the FRA would be meeting in October, when the railroad will provide an update on an internal review of its daily repair process.He wrote that the “Union Pacific team works hand-in-hand with FRA inspectors toward shared safety goals, and we respect that partnership. We look forward to receiving and examining the details of your findings while we continue conducting an audit of our processes.”The FRA and U.S. Department of Transportation have been under pressure to take a more proactive stance to bolster rail safety following the Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.Meanwhile, STB’s Oberman and railroad unions have put pressure on UP in recent years over possible correlations between reductions in employee head count and deteriorating rail service.According to the FRA, the focused inspections that occurred at UP over the summer were a type of inspection performed routinely. These types of inspections are generally centered on a single discipline, such as track, mechanical equipment, operating practices or signals, and the focused inspections may just hone in on one part of the railroad, such as a specific geographic territory, or it might be systemwide. The focused inspections might be triggered by data trends identified by FRA, such as an increase in defects or violations, and the intent is to assess and bring a railroad into full compliance with federal regulations.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Union Pacific expects to respond quickly to safety concerns raised by FRAUnion Pacific furloughs workers due to lower volumesUP still working to restore tracks in Yuma subdivisionAll eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union PacificNew labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millionsFederal regulators plan broad safety review of all Class I railroadsThe post Union Pacific defends rail safety program appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

We will also discuss the emerging trends and how the industry is evolving. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Top 5 Sports Tech Companies And Startups In The World.The Intersection of Sports and TechTechnology impacts all aspects of our lives, including sports and athleticism. Sports tech has emerged as a significant market over time. At its core, sports technology is the intermingling of technology with various aspects of sports, including improving athletic performance, fan engagement, and coaching. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global sports tech market was valued at $14.72 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $55.14 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.8%. In 2022, Europe accounted for 30% of the total revenue share and is expected to grow persistently over the forecast period. The presence of leagues like the Premier League and English Football League was the prime contributor to this massive share. The Middle East has been estimated to grow at a CAGR of 21% over the forecast period. There has been a rise in the popularity of sports tourism and hosting sports events, which is expected to fuel this growth. Post-Pandemic Sports Tech Industry: An OverviewThe pandemic led to a global lockdown. The world slowed down, people worked from home, and mobility was greatly compromised. The situation boosted the demand for sports tech including esports, virtual entertainment, and streaming platforms. Companies like Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) became increasingly popular with regular launches of games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) is one of the best esports stocks to buy in 2023. The company has even gained the attention of the technology giant, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) for almost half a year now. The merger initially faced some regulatory issues, however, the companies seem hopeful that it will go through. Story continuesOn September 1, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its vision for this acquisition and how it would benefit the industry and players. The company will have a subscription option, Game Pass, that will enable users to access the large gaming library of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI). The acquisition would also enable the company to develop and deliver more engaging games, especially for the mobile platform, that can be accessed using the cloud services. The lockdown insidiously changed our lifestyle choices for almost two years, making it more sedentary. Regular exercise and sports are essential for our physical and mental health and play a vital role in community building. For a world recovering from the pandemic, sports tech presents an unmatched opportunity to reinvigorate a healthy lifestyle. The amalgamation of sports and tech has the potential to change the world for the better. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has multiple sports tech products specially designed to help users adopt a better lifestyle, including the Apple Watch, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Health App. The products help users keep track of their daily activities, follow fitness plans, and monitor changes respectively. They are enabling users to make conscious decisions based on actual data. On August 26, Forbes reported that the new Apple Watch Ultra is expected to be released on the 12th of September. The new Apple Watch Ultra has a rugged design, especially for people participating in hardcore sports. It has features to cater to the needs of athletes and adventurers.Sports tech could be used to enhance athletes' performance. Catapult Group International Ltd (ASX:CAT) is one of the most prominent names in this regard. The Australian company combines wearable technology with high-tech videos to yield optimal results. According to an article by Forbes, Catapult Group International Ltd (ASX:CAT) is very ambitious about the future of sports tech and is focused on providing 'prescriptive analysis' compared to the prevalent 'descriptive analysis' in sports. The prescriptive analysis focuses on what could be done to enhance performance in the future compared to a descriptive analysis which just gives information about the athlete's performance in real time. Sports tech companies also facilitate players to interact and nurture community building. The post-pandemic world is drowning in a mental health crisis. SportsEngine is a platform designed for the youth, facilitating them to find the right sports programs near them. The platform also has specific content for athletes, parents, coaches, administrators, and sports fans. The short form sports videos have also caused an upsurge in the popularity of sports. Post-pandemic entertainment consumption heavily relies on shorter video content like YouTube shorts, TikTok, and Instagram reels. The younger population engages with sports primarily on their phones and wants to see specific sports covered. The users want to have more control over what they are watching. The changing audience preferences have led to the creation of platforms like CBS Sports Spectacular that cover different sports every week based on audience requests. It has a 73.6% higher demand than all factual titles in the US. Going to a stadium might be traditional; however, even the best stadiums in the world are integrating sports tech. How fans interact with sports is also changing rapidly. The biggest tech companies are incorporating new cutting-edge technologies like augmented and virtual reality to enhance user experience. On June 6, Business Insider reported that Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is working on using Apple Vision Pro to view sports. The VR headset by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would enable viewers to see 5 different sports at once. The sports tech industry is constantly growing. The sports tech arena is full of players ranging from big technology companies to budding startups.

The latest release of Cisco Secure Application helps customers to securely manage cloud native applications in addition to hybrid applications.Cisco Logo (PRNewsfoto/Cisco)In the race to deliver seamless digital experiences, IT teams have experienced an increase in the need to shift to modern, distributed applications, but according to a recent Cisco study, 92% of global technologists admit that the rush to rapidly innovate and respond to the changing needs of customers has come at the expense of robust application security during software development1.This has left companies exposed to security vulnerabilities and threats, with larger attack surfaces and gaps in their application security layer caused by siloed teams both struggling to gain visibility and the right business context to prioritize vulnerabilities. As a result, organizations are reporting an explosion of security incidents in the modern environment, putting customer data and the reputation of their business at risk.Story continuesTo help organizations secure cloud native applications, the new Cisco Secure Application offering – now available on Cisco's recently launched Full-Stack Observability Platform - arms customers with expanded visibility and intelligent business risk insights across cloud environments, empowering businesses to better prioritize and respond in real-time to revenue and reputation-impacting security risks and reduce overall organizational risk profiles.Cisco Secure Application integrates with Cisco's industry leading security products and enables customers to:Locate and highlight security issues across application entities, including services, workloads, pods, containers and business transactions, and isolate them at speed.Prioritize issues with a business risk score that combines application performance data and business impact context from Cisco's own Cloud Native Application Observability, with real-time vulnerability detection and security intelligence from Cisco's security products, to identify which business transactions present the greatest risk.Accelerate response time to security incidents with real-time remediation guidance, complete with prescriptive actions to prioritize and address the most impactful security vulnerabilities.""Application security has never been a more pressing priority for businesses, and traditional vulnerability scanning solutions simply don't provide the information that teams need,"" said Ronak Desai, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cisco Full-Stack Observability and AppDynamics. ""An organization's ability to quickly assess risks based on potential business impact, align teams and triage threats is entirely dependent on understanding where vulnerabilities exist, the severity of those risks, the likelihood they will be exploited, and the risk to the business of each issue. This business risk observability can help IT professionals understand and prioritize those risks and is uniquely delivered by Cisco. The availability of Cisco Secure Application on the Cisco Full-Stack Observability Platform is a critical next step in our commitment to providing customers with the tools they need to deliver unmatched and secure digital experiences across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.""""The successful digital infrastructure must operate as a concert – not as a collection of separate products, providers, and people. This requires all components – from core to edge, from network to applications, from on-premises systems to public cloud and communications services – to work as one to deliver the best digital experiences,"" asserts Mark Leary, Research Director, IDC. ""Cisco's extensive domain experience across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and comprehensive full tech stack oversight positions the company well to help customers bring application observability, security intelligence data, and business risk observability together. Combined, they give customers access to the critical information they need to make smart decisions about their application security.""About Cisco Full-Stack Observability Platform Cisco Full-Stack Observability Platform—a vendor-agnostic solution that harnesses the power of the company's full portfolio – was launched at Cisco Live US in June 2023.

368,677668df-78f9-3f5b-b9ca-855721eeb9db,CSCO,2023-09-13,Cisco: What I Learned During Last Year’s World Cleanup Day and Why You Should Participate Too,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-learned-during-last-world-124000044.html,1694522400,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 12, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.:At Cisco, we believe in powering an inclusive future for all by bringing communities together and creating meaningful change for everyone, including our planet. This is also clearly reflected in our culture of giving back. Each employee gets paid time off called Time2Give which they can use to volunteer for a cause that matters to them. I used one of these days last year to participate in a cleanup event in the Netherlands during World Cleanup Day.Doing good for the planet does not only have to involve big actions, like buying an electric vehicle or switching to solar. Small actions are also impactful, especially when people work together.The various actions you can take during World Cleanup Day every mid-September are a great example. On World Cleanup Day, millions of people from all around the world come together with their communities to make the world a bit cleaner. The event originated in Estonia in 2018, when 50,000 people united to clean up their country in just a few hours. This sparked a global movement and the idea spread fast.Now, many different events are organized worldwide, and lots of locals are contributing by cleaning up their own neighborhood.During last year's World Cleanup Day, 15 million people participated in 190 different countries. The beauty of the event is that we're not only making the earth a bit cleaner, but also the cooperation and collaboration between different communities is wonderful to see as well. It's a great opportunity to reflect on all the litter in your area and how it got there. You'll be surprised by all the things you can find while cleaning up your neighborhood.The Cisco Amsterdam office has participated in this event for the past four years. Cisco Netherlands has raised thousands of euros for their charity partner the Plastic Soup Foundation. For the past three years we've been donating to this charity when we hold cleanup events, because the mission of this charity aligns with the mission of World Cleanup Day; to stop plastic pollution.Story continuesThe Cisco Netherland's team marked World Cleanup Day in 2022 through multiple cleanup activities. Over a four-day period, Cisco colleagues gathered in five different places across the Netherlands to clean up litter.From gathering litter around the office area, to different cities like Amsterdam, Alkmaar, The Hague and Haarlem, nearly one-hundred people in total joined the cleanup activities!Volunteering to pick up litter is not only impactful for your local community but can also be a fun group activity to get to know people, or in this case your colleagues.I joined the cleanup event in the city of Hague. This was the first time that I participated in a cleanup activity since joining Cisco. After hearing about World Cleanup Day, I researched about litter in my country and the results shocked me. It is estimated that every year in the Netherlands, 50 million kilo of litter end up on the streets or the environment (source)! This made me think twice about all the litter that's probably out on the streets in my area and motivated me even more to join the cleanup.It was a very pleasant experience; I met new people and had great conversations with them while cleaning up. We had a lot to talk about since we ended up finding a lot of weird items, like an abandoned backpack with cigars. Guessing the background story of random items was a fun activity. We finished the day together with a snack to celebrate. It left me with a great feeling, and I knew I wanted to do activities like this more often. I now realize that doing it together with people is what makes an activity like this such a great experience.Are you planning on participating in the next World Cleanup Day on September 16th? Here are some easy ways to get involved:Gather your friends, family, or colleagues and unite to clean up your communityHelp make your own environment a bit cleaner by picking up any litter you come across while taking a walk or even running errandsSpread the word! Be an advocate for this great initiative by talking about it with others and sharing information about your cleanups on social mediaView original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/783240/cisco-what-i-learned-during-last-years-world-cleanup-day-and-why-you-should-participate-too]"
