But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.16, while TXN has a forward P/E of 23.39. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 2.43. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.51.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 3.50. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 10.95.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to STM's Value grade of B and TXN's Value grade of C.Story continuesSTM stands above TXN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that STM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$185 and falling to the lows of US$161. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$176 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Texas Instruments’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Is Texas Instruments Still Cheap?The stock is currently trading at US$176 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 29% compared to my intrinsic value of $136.53. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Texas Instruments’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Texas Instruments?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -9.0% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Texas Instruments. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe TXN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TXN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Price climbed passed its true value, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Texas Instruments at this point in time.

Sales of crop nutrients increased in the quarter on higher prices. Sales of crop protection products also increased owing to higher selling prices and increased sales of proprietary products.The Potash division’s sales declined 3% year over year to $1,377 million.

However, volumes in North America were impacted by a compressed spring application season.Sales in the Nitrogen segment were $1,541 million, up around 5.8% year over year. The upside can be attributed to higher net realized selling prices due to robust benchmark prices.

6,b8daa6f5-1770-36b4-9c19-b7ae885bd5b4,UNM,2023-02-18,Unum (UNM) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-could-great-choice-164504652.html,1676652304,STORY,['UNM'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusHeadquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4.36% so far this year. The insurance company is paying out a dividend of $0.33 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.08% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.29% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.16%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 21%. This means it paid out 21% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.42 per share, with earnings expected to increase 3.38% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SHOO to report a year-over-year decrease in its top line when it releases fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 23, before the market open.

Also, the consensus mark indicates a decline of 49.4% from 87 cents earned in the year-earlier quarter.We expect revenues of $454.1 million to reflect a decline of 21.5% year over year and the bottom line to plunge 49.6% to 44 cents per share for the fourth quarter.A glance at this fashion-forward footwear, apparel and accessories dealer’s performance in the trailing four quarters shows that it has an earnings surprise of 29.4%, on average.Key Factors to NoteSteven Madden’s fourth-quarter performance might have been hurt by a challenging macroeconomic landscape. The ongoing uncertainties including inflationary pressures and currency headwinds might have been deterrents. The company has been witnessing deleveraged operating expenses for a while now. Higher warehouse and payroll costs have been resulting in higher operating costs. All these headwinds might hurt the company’s performance during the quarter under review.On the flip side, Steven Madden’s efforts with respect to brand strength, product assortments, international expansion and direct-to-consumer channels appear encouraging. The company’s expansion into categories outside of footwear, such as handbags and apparel, is an added positive. Overall, Steven Madden is focused on creating a trend-right merchandise assortment, deepening relations with customers via marketing, enhancing the digital commerce agenda and efficiently controlling expenses.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Steven Madden this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

This indicates growth of 4% at the mid-point of the range and 9% in constant currency. This includes more than 20% growth for both the international business and the Merrell brand. The company anticipated the flagship brand’s revenues to grow in the high-single digits, partly driven by a timing shift to some of the shipments into the fourth quarter from the third, owing to logistic headwinds.On the flip side, higher adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses are likely to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the macro challenges, including foreign currency headwinds and inventory issues, are likely to have been deterrents. These factors are anticipated to have hurt margins and the bottom line in the quarter under review.Story continuesOn its last earnings call, management had forecast an adjusted gross margin of 38% for the fourth quarter, suggesting a decline from 42.4% recorded in the year-earlier quarter. The decline shows WWW’s efforts to reduce seasonal inventory, as well as increased logistics and handling costs with adverse foreign exchange rates. It projected adjusted SG&amp;A expenses to be 37% of the fourth-quarter sales, suggesting a rise from the third-quarter level due to the higher mix of December-quarter D2C revenues, including Sweaty Betty.Management had earlier envisioned a loss per share of 9-19 cents and an adjusted loss per share of 5-15 cents for the fourth quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations are likely to hurt to the tune of 3 cents per share. Wolverine anticipated Sweaty Betty to be affected by macro challenges and its revenues to decline in the high-single digits in the fourth quarter.What Our Zacks Model SaysOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Wolverine this time around.

Many investors follow his trades to a ""t"" even going as far as replicating them.But should you?This filing had some surprising sales and few stock purchases, even though the stock market was still selling off, and many stocks were cheap on a valuation basis, and Berkshire was still sitting on a pile of cash.What is Buffett waiting for? Is his lack of purchases a sign that he thinks stocks have further to sell-off? Or did he ""miss"" the bottom again, like he did in 2020's pandemic sell-off when he also didn't jump in to buy?Let's look at 5 of the key buys and sales in Q4.Berkshire Hathaway's Big Buys, and Sales, in the Fourth Quarter of 20221.      Taiwan Semiconductor TSMBerkshire Hathaway first bought a position in Taiwan Semiconductor in the third quarter of 2022 to much fanfare. It was a $4.2 billion position and the first semiconductor company to be in the portfolio for years.Story continuesBut in the fourth quarter, just a few months later, Berkshire sold 86% of its Taiwan Semiconductor shares. It went from 60 million shares to just 8.3 million.What happened to the infamous Buffett strategy of the best time to sell is never? Even worse, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor have rallied big in 2023, adding 24.5%.Does this sale of Taiwan Semiconductor make any sense?2.      Chevron CVXBerkshire Hathaway has gone all in on the energy companies over the last 2 years, buying billions of dollars of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum.But in the fourth quarter of 2022, it sold 1%, or 2.4 million shares, of its Chevron position. This was also a head scratcher to many. What's the point of selling such a small position?Is Buffett still a big believer in Chevron?3.      US Bancorp USBBerkshire continues to sell shares of its regional banks. It first bought US Bancorp in the first quarter of 2006. But in the fourth quarter, it sold 91% of its shares.US Bancorp is now just a 0.10% position in the Berkshire portfolio. Will it be completely eliminated in Q1 of this year?US Bancorp shares are up 12.5% year-to-date, but over the last 5 years are down 11.7%. It's been tough owning the banks.4.      Apple AAPLApple remains Berkshire's largest position in its equity portfolio, at 38.9% of the portfolio. But that didn't keep Berkshire from adding to its position in the fourth quarter as the Apple shares sold off.Berkshire bought 333,856 shares of Apple in the fourth quarter, but it has 895 million shares so this is really a small buy. Why not buy more? Berkshire has plenty of cash to do so.Does Apple remain the jewel in the Berkshire crown?5.      Amazon AMZNBerkshire has a small position in Amazon that it bought in the first quarter of 2019. It has never sold, nor bought, any more shares.But Amazon's shares fell 50% last year and are still down 35% over the last year even with 2023's rally.Why not buy more, like Berkshire did with Apple, when they sold off? This has not been a good trade for Berkshire. From Mar 29, 2019 to Feb 15, 2023, the shares are up just 12.6% but, meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 was up 45.9% during the same time. And that's without the dividends included.What's going on with the Amazon position?What Else Do You Need to Know About Berkshire's Fourth Quarter Trades?Listen to this week's podcast to find out.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Sales for the quarter are expected to be $35.91 billion and virtually flat from a year ago.Home Depot Earnings ESP: The Zacks Surprise Prediction indicates Home Depot should reach quarterly expectations on its bottom line with the Zacks Consensus for Q4 EPS on par with the Most Accurate Consensus of $3.26.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRounding out its fiscal 2023, Home Depot’s earnings are now forecasted to be up 7% to $16.64 a share compared to EPS of $15.53 in 2022. Earnings are expected to rise another 1% in FY24. However, earnings estimate revisions are down over the last quarter.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 4% in FY23 and be virtually flat in FY24 at $158.51 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2024 sales would represent 46% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $108.20 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT Q4 Preview &amp; OutlookTurning to Walmart, Q4 earnings are forecasted at $1.52 per share which is roughly on par with the prior year quarter. Fourth-quarter Sales are projected at $159.66 billion, up 4% YoY.Walmart Earnings ESP: Walmart is expected to slightly top bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Consensus at $1.54 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $1.52.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWalmart is now expected to finish fiscal 2023 with EPS of $6.08 which would roughly be a -6% decline from FY22 earnings of $6.46 a share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to rebound and rise 6% at $6.49 per share. However, earnings estimates have also gone down for Walmart throughout the quarter.Story continuesWalmart sales are now projected to be up 6% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $627.30 billion. Fiscal 2024 would be a 22% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $514.40 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationOver the last year, Walmart’s +6% has outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -7% and Home Depot’s -8% performance. However, over the last decade, Home Depot’s +505% total return including dividends has easily topped the benchmark and Walmart’s +159%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a valuation standpoint, both stocks trade attractively relative to their past but Home Depot appears to have a slight edge.Shares of Home Depot trade at $317 per share and 18.9X forward earnings which is above its industry average of 12.2X. However, Home Depot is a proven industry leader and trades 33% below its decade high of 28.1X and 11% beneath the median of 21.2X.In comparison, Walmart trades at $146 a share and 22.5X forward earnings, well above its industry average of 11.7X although it’s also a leader. Shares of WMT trade 20% below its own decade-long high of 28.1X but 23% above the median of 18.3X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsDividends are always appealing to investors, and both Home Depot and Walmart stick out in this regard. Walmart is currently a Dividend Aristocrat, raising its yield for more than 25 consecutive years (49 Years) with the company announcing yesterday that it will raise its dividend by 2% in 2023 to $2.24 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Walmart is on the cusp of being a Dividend King upon raising its dividend again in 2024 (50 Consecutive years) Home Depot’s yield is satisfying as well. Home Depot’s 2.37% annual dividend yield tops Walmart’s 1.55% with both above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.18%.TakeawayBoth Walmart and Home Depot stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) heading into their earnings reports next week. Much of the upside in their stocks will depend upon the guidance they can offer which will also give a broader insight into the current behavior of the consumer.Walmart will stand to benefit if a wider audience of consumers continues to choose the retailer as an option to save or spend less amid economic uncertainty and higher inflation. This along with continued improvement in inventory and operating costs.Effective management of costs during a broadly tougher operating environment will also be key for Home Depot along with inflation hopefully having a less dismal effect on consumers’ demand for home improvement products.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

15,99bc1e6b-acae-3a03-861d-03c5848ab2ae,WMT,2023-02-18,"Target, Walmart and More Retailers With the Best In-Store Shopping Experiences, According to Consumers",GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-walmart-more-retailers-consumers-110022133.html,1676671228,STORY,"['TGT', 'WMT', 'COST']","[hapabapa / Getty ImagesAmerican consumers have a wide array of choices when it comes to retail in-store shopping, but some specific criteria make some of these stores a better shopping experience for consumers. Thanks to a few unique touches and options, Target, Walmart and Costco take the top spots in terms of the best in-store shopping experiences, according to a new GOBankingRates survey.Good To Know: 10 Dollar Store Items That Aren’t Even Worth the BuckSee the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023When given a choice between several popular retailers — including Costco, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, IKEA, Target and Walmart — the survey finds that American consumers favor Target by far for in-store shopping, with 36% selecting it as having the best experience. In terms of age groups, Target was more favored by the 25 to 34 age group, with 47% selecting it as their top choice, followed by the 18 to 24 age group, with 41%.After Target, the survey finds that American consumers like Walmart the second most for in-store shopping, with 27%.But what makes these big-box retailers different?What Makes Target and Walmart Stand Out the Most?Shannon Vissers, retail analyst with MerchantMaverick.com, told GOBankingRates that Walmart and Target have a lot going for them when it comes to their in-store shopping experience, as the name of the game with both of these retailers is convenience.“Both stores have an in-store cafe, affordable pricing and self-checkout options,” she said. “The shelves are dependably well-stocked, the store layout is easy to navigate and there is usually ample parking. I think that even though its prices are slightly higher, Target beats Walmart because the experience is a little calmer and more aesthetically pleasing — think: better lighting, better item-merchandising, trendier design and wider aisles.”On the other hand, Walmart often locks up a lot of its high-theft items including certain toiletries and other goods, which adds a level of inconvenience and a certain distaste to the shopping experience, Vissers added, while Target benefits from having Starbucks cafes in-store — and in some cases, the carts even have cup holders, making it easier to shop and sip.Story continuesPhillipe Leblanc, co-CEO and co-founder of Funday, echoed the sentiment, saying that the retail landscape has been previously marked by the need to one-up competitors, but Walmart and Target are turning this model upside down and putting customer needs at the forefront.“From wider aisles to clear signage and an abundance of options, they are taking actions that resonate with customers — in-store and online,” he said. He also noted that if one looks at factors such as their return policies and cash-back options, “they are aiming to give back control to the consumer, which is a crucial part in long-term success.”Take Our Poll: What Are Your Financial Priorities in 2023?Why Costco’s Third Place Finish Is So Far BehindFollowing Target and Walmart for the top three best in-store shopping experiences is Costco, which is notably further behind with 13%.Merchant Maverick’s Vissers calls it “another animal”: While the bulk pricing, free samples and wide range of goods sold bring huge crowds, there are some reasons Costco falls behind the other two.“The layout is far from intuitive, and it is not a store where you can quickly find and buy what you need. The experience can be overwhelming and daunting, not suitable for a short, convenient trip. Nevertheless, many people enjoy making a half-day shopping experience at Costco,” she said.She also said that Costco’s aisles aren’t labeled, and the items therein don’t always follow a particular rhyme or reason, but this lack of organization can lead to the “thrill of discovery,” with shoppers stumbling upon new items they wouldn’t have otherwise in a traditional retail store.The Others on the List: Stores Where You Can’t One-Stop ShopThe GOBankingRates survey finds that at the bottom of the list in terms of the best in-store shopping experience are IKEA, with 9%; Dollar Tree, with 9%; Dollar General, with 4%; and Five Below, with 3%.Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, told GOBankingRates that the importance of the one-stop shop seems to have grown during the pandemic.“I suppose it’s not an entirely new trend, but especially earlier in the pandemic when many people were really afraid to leave their homes, the ability to go to one store and hopefully get everything you need is a powerful motivator,” he said. “If you feel like you’re risking your health by venturing out, you at least want to feel like it’s worth it and want to minimize the need to drive all over town and traipse up and down the aisles of a bunch of different stores.”In addition, he said that gas prices have probably taken over from COVID-19 as the primary motivator to minimize “the schlepping all over town.”“Target and Walmart have also embraced the hybrid lifestyle, offering in-store shopping, online and a mix via curbside pickup. Many people seem to like the ability to order from home, work, etc. and swing by to get the merchandise right away without waiting a couple days for shipping,” he said.More From GOBankingRatesCostco's Best Deals?

You can see this in the chart below that shows the one-year performance of Walmart relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line) and the Zacks Retail sector (red line).Since the October lows, Walmart shares are up +11.3% while the S&amp;P 500 index has gained +13.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress’. This almost ‘staple’ aspect of Walmart’s business can also be seen in the recent stock market behavior of Costco (COST) and others.Target (TGT) shares stand out for their underperformance, but that is more reflective of management’s missteps in executing in the post-Covid environment. Also, relative to Walmart and Costco, Target has a relatively smaller grocery business and has relatively more exposure to discretionary spending categories.Walmart is expected to report essentially flat earnings on +4.4% higher revenues in its quarterly report before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 21st. The market liked what it saw in the company’s last two quarterly reports on November 15th and August 16th, 2022.Target will be releasing its quarterly results a week later on February 28th. Target shares were down big in response to each of the preceding three quarterly releases, with the May 2022 release particularly notable. Analysts have generally lowered their Target estimates since the company’s last quarterly report on November 16th, while the same for Walmart has been modestly positive.  With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -48.9% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues, with 64.7% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.Story continuesThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers starting to report results this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 600 companies on deck to report results this week, including 60 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Nvidia, Alibaba, eBay, Home Depot and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 17th, we now have Q4 results from 407 S&amp;P 500 members or 81.4% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +5.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.3% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the EPS and revenue beats percentages in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see, there is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared. You can see this in the chart below that shows how estimates for the current period (2023 Q1) have evolved in recent weeks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.The chart below shows the aggregate earnings total for the index since the start of last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the $1.915 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.89, down from $216.09 last week and the $216.18 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.The chart below shows this 2023 index ‘EPS’ estimate has evolved since the start of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is a fairly reassuring outcome.The chart below shows the expected 2022 Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectation in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Making Sense of Earnings Estimate Revisions for Q1 FY23 and Beyond Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: MCHP) a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions, today announces plans to invest $880M to expand its silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon (Si) production capacity at its Colorado Springs, Colo. manufacturing facility over the next several years.One significant phase of the expansion is to develop and upgrade its 50-acre, 580,000-square-foot Colorado Springs campus for increased SiC manufacturing for use in automotive/E-Mobility, grid infrastructure, green energy, and aerospace and defense applications.Working in conjunction with the Colorado Springs Chamber &amp; Economic Development Corporation, the City of Colorado Springs and El Paso County also announce that Microchip was approved for state and local incentives of approximately $47M for the expansion.Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said, “We are very pleased Microchip has selected its Colorado Springs facility as the site for such a significant investment and expansion. We estimate this will grow our local economy by approximately $1.4 billion over the next 10 years and create roughly 400 new high-paying jobs for those living in the Pikes Peak Region. Ramping up the production of semiconductors is critical to satisfying growing demand across many industries, and Colorado Springs is proud to be one of the key locations where this effort is taking place.” U.S. Senator for Colorado Michael Bennet said, “Last year, I helped pass the CHIPS and Science Act to reinvigorate America’s semiconductor industry and bring manufacturing jobs back to America. In Colorado, we’re already seeing the benefits as companies prepare for historic investments from the law. Microchip’s planned expansion in Colorado Springs will not only strengthen our national security, but also expand opportunity with another 400 good-paying jobs.”Story continuesU.S. Senator for Colorado John Hickenlooper said, “Thanks to our CHIPS Act and Microchip, we’re bringing manufacturing back to America. Semiconductors are the space race of our time, and Colorado is going to help us win it.”U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn said, “It is exciting to have Microchip Technology expanding its footprint and investing in its chip manufacturing facility in Colorado’s 5th Congressional District. As concerns mount over foreign dominance of this critical industry, it is increasingly important that the U.S. achieve domestic production of microchips. I commend the City of Colorado Springs and the Colorado Springs Chamber for their dedication to bringing high-paying, high-quality jobs, and great companies to the Pikes Peak region.""President and CEO of Microchip Technology Ganesh Moorthy said, “Microchip Colorado Springs has a long history of partnering with the city and state and we applaud their continued support of our efforts to advance the semiconductor industry in the U.S. The CHIPS and Science Act is already making a positive impact on our business through the Investment Tax Credit and we are seeking capacity expansion grants for several of our semiconductor factories, including our Colorado Springs factory. We see a bright future in the region made possible by great partnerships, state and local incentives, and a strong local talented workforce.”The Colorado Springs campus currently employs more than 850 people and produces products from 6-inch wafers. The manufacturing technology that Microchip is installing will run on 8-inch wafers, which will significantly increase the number of chips produced at this location. The additional 400 jobs anticipated at the facility will range from production specialists to technical roles in equipment procurement and management, process control and test engineering.“With over two-decades of investment in silicon carbide, Microchip’s portfolio is designed to provide our customers with innovative power solutions,” said Rich Simoncic, senior vice president of Microchip’s Analog businesses. “This campus is an integral part of producing our SiC technology to assure our customers with supply certainty as they transition to SiC solutions.”“Microchip’s expansion in Colorado Springs and El Paso County puts our region on the map for investment from the CHIPS and Science Act. We are proud to lead Microchip’s expansion project and support the reshoring of these important manufacturing jobs to the Pikes Peak region,” said Johnna Reeder Kleymeyer, President and CEO, Colorado Springs Chamber &amp; Economic Development Corporation.Resources  High-res images available through Flickr or editorial contact (feel free to publish):Image: www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/52678761206/sizes/lCautionary Statement:  The statements in this release relating to our plans to invest $880 million to expand our silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon (Si) capacity, that ramping up production at our Colorado Springs fabrication campus will enable us to respond to growing semiconductor demand across a wide swath of industries, that the increased SiC manufacturing is for use in automotive/ E-Mobility, grid infrastructure, green energy, and aerospace and defense applications, that this investment will grow the local economy by approximately $1.4 billion over the next 10 years, that we may increase head count by over 400 employees, that the expansion in Colorado Springs will strengthen our national security, that the CHIPS Act is making a positive impact on our business through the Investment tax Credit, that we are seeking capacity expansion grants for several of our semiconductor factories including our Colorado Springs factory, that we see a bright future in the region made possible by great partnerships, state and local incentives and a strong local talented workforce, [AND ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN ADDITIONAL QUOTES THAT ARE ADDED] are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

MCHP, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Market VolatilityAfter a strong comeback from last year's steep losses, the U.S. stocks lost momentum lately on uncertain Fed rate hike plans and recession fears. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing once again. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Xcel Energy Inc., Cardinal Health Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

And in fact-- there we go-- with the S&amp;P's largest large-cap energy index, it's having its worst day since November.And this is on the back of crude oil selling off again below $80 a barrel. Saudi oil minister-- name is Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman-- he has huge sway in the OPEC+ cartel. He's doubling down on the group's agreement late last year to stop intervening in the oil market. And we see crude oil, today it was off about 3%, down to about $75, $76 per barrel. You can see it right there-- 76.34. Well, even if it went into the 60s, they're saying they're going to stand by. That would mean good prices-- good thing for consumers at the pump here.But when it comes to the energy producers, they're having a little bit of a rough go of it. Now, don't shed a tear for these guys. They had a great last year. And ExxonMobil, I'm just going to pull up a chart here. You can see over the last two years, it has more than doubled, up over 111%.DAVE BRIGGS: And it is some good news for those drivers at the pump. We're seeing gas prices, 3.42. Kind of settle in down a penny in a week and only up, what, $0.09 over the last month. So seems like pretty solid level that they're settling in on for now.]"

Interest in coal stocks waned so much that the VanEck Vectors coal ETF (KOL), the only coal ETF in the U.S., stopped trading after more than a decade of being active.Investment giants like Blackrock BLK have pushed for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and have promised to reduce investments in companies that produce emissions. Meanwhile, clean energy has taken a bigger slice of the pie, and energy solutions such as solar have become more efficient in recent years.Expect the UnexpectedWall Street is never obvious. Knowing what occurred over the past decade, one would think that very few if any coal stocks would be in business, let alone performing well. However, that is exactly what is happening. Over the past two years, coal stocks have remained in business and quietly became market leaders and some of the top performing stocks in the entire market. For example, since 2021, public coal producers such as Arch Resources Inc ARCH have gained 283%, while Alpha Metallurgical Resources AMR is up a mind-blowing 1,097%!Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat is Driving the Stellar Performance?Coal stocks not only have scorching hot performance but are also highly ranked. The coal industry ranks 19 out of the 251 industries tracked by Zacks, putting it in the top 8%. Arch Resources, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP, and Warrior Met Coal HCC hold a best possible Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while a handful of peers such as Peabody Energy BTU earn #2 (Buy) ranks. Coal stocks are benefitting from a variety of factors, including:Story continuesClean Energy is not Enough to Meet Supply Void:Despite the advent of the green energy revolution, the increase in alternative energy has not been enough to stave off increasing energy demand in recent years.Industry Consolidation: Because many weaker coal companies went out of business a few years ago, the remaining coal companies are benefiting from soaring demand.ESG:There’s a big difference between what many of the ESG proponents are saying versus doing. Contrary to the rhetoric around decreasing emissions, firms such as Blackrock, Bank of America BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, and J.P Morgan JPM, continue to invest billions of dollars in coal and other “dirty” energy.  FundamentalsThe soaring stock prices in the coal industry are not without merit. For example, Arch Resources grew EPS by 94% year-over-year in its latest quarter, while Alliance Resource Partners’ EPS vaulted more than 300%. SunCoke Energy SXC is yet another strong coal performer. Last quarter, earnings surprised by 133.33%, and the Consensus Estimate Trend has been positive over the past 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical Picture: Breakouts GaloreWhile the coal industry has seen a meteoric rise over the past two years, most names in the group have consolidated and digested in recent months. However, following recent blowout earnings, and firm EPS estimates moving forward, the coal leaders such as ARCH and HCC look poised to continue their uptrends. Both names are examples of just some of the coal stocks breaking out. On Thursday, ARCH rocketed higher by nearly 10% on volume more than double the norm. HCC is also breaking out from a multi-month base after a strong earnings report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayIndustry consolidation, strong demand, and a lack of ESG adherence is leading to strength in the coal industry. Recent earnings have been strong, expectations moving forward are robust, and multiple stocks are staging breakouts simultaneously – a confirmation signal for technicians. For these reasons, investors should remain bullish on coal leaders such as Warrior Met Coal and Arch Resources.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

From 2025 the government plans to release a new sustainable jobs plan every five years.""Canada has what it takes to become the clean energy and technology supplier of choice in a net-zero world,"" Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a news release.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been promising sustainable jobs legislation since 2019. But in Canada, the world's fourth-largest crude oil producer, the concept of retraining workers for clean energy jobs, also called a ""Just Transition"", became a lightening rod for criticism.In the crude-producing province Alberta, conservative Premier Danielle Smith has accused Trudeau of wanting to phase out the oil and gas sector.The Alberta government is ""perplexed"" by the jobs plan not mentioning a liquefied natural gas export strategy and has ""grave concerns"" about it not recognising the provinces' right to manage their own natural resources, Smith said in a statement on Friday.""This kind of dysfunctional communication by the federal government with our province cannot continue if Canada is to have any chance of achieving its 2050 emissions reduction targets,"" she said.The federal government said enormous clean energy opportunities are emerging in oil-producing provinces, from hydrogen to critical minerals. There will also be sustainable jobs in conventional energy industries as Canadian producers aim to lower the carbon intensity of their crude, according to the document.Story continues""Rather than a shortage of jobs, in Canada we are much more likely to see an abundance of sustainable jobs with a shortage of workers required to fill them,"" the plan said.Think-tanks Clean Energy Canada expects jobs in the sector will grow by 3.4% annually over the next decade, nearly four times faster than the Canadian average.On Thursday, Smith wrote to Trudeau offering to collaborate with the federal government on developing carbon capture and storage incentives, but only if Ottawa secured Alberta's consent on climate policies that affect oil and gas, including clean energy jobs legislation.

(NYSE:FE) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 14, 2023Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Irene Prezelj, you may begin.Irene Prezelj: Thank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year, can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website.We'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&amp;A session. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder.John Somerhalder: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had a strong year in 2022, and we are excited to make even more progress on our goals in 2023. Our full year 2022 GAAP earnings are $0.71 per share and operating earnings are $2.41 per share, which is slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Before I get started today, I would like to take a minute to say thank you to all of our employees for their efforts over the past year. I'm proud of what they've accomplished and company we have become. Our progress this past year is due to the efforts of our 12,000 employees who are serving our customers and working to make this company better for the long term. Thank you. With that, we have a lot of ground to cover today, so let's get started.Story continuesTwo years ago, we were taking some of the first steps to transform FirstEnergy. In 2022, we hit full stride, stretching ourselves to strengthen and enhance nearly every aspect of our organization. The scope and pace of these changes have been remarkable. Just to touch on a few of the highlights. First, we made significant improvements in our financial position. This includes deploying proceeds from the $1 billion common equity issuance that closed in late 2021, together with the $2.4 billion to 19.9% interest sale in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC that closed midyear to reduce debt by nearly $3 billion in 2022, most of which was at APICORP. As a result, we lowered holding company debt as a percentage of total debt to 24% from 33% at the end of 2021.On the operational front, we transitioned to a new five-state operating model and engaged in more than 175 projects across the Company to modernize the way we work and deliver a superior customer experience as part of our FE Forward program. At the same time, we continue to enrich our culture with an unwavering commitment to our core values. As a result of this work, we're entering 2023 as a more innovative, efficient and forward-thinking organization where employees are sharing ideas and working to move the Company forward. This year, we intend to build on our momentum. We're working to be a premier electric company with a strong foundation and a customer center focus that is enabling the clean energy transition. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion.This transaction, which is expected to close in early 2024, supports our plans to improve our balance sheet and for approximately $1 billion of incremental capital investments, which we believe will drive long-term value for all our stakeholders. And as John will discuss, our regulatory calendar will address the critical investments that support reliability and smarter and cleaner electric grid. We are introducing 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 6% growth from our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share, and it offsets the pension impacts we discussed last year. We are also introducing first quarter 2023 guidance of $0.56 to $0.66 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate, which represents year-over-year growth based off of the prior year guidance midpoint.I'd like to spend a moment to provide an update on the CEO search process, and I realize there is much interest in this important topic. Late last year, we shared the broad criteria that we were looking for a strong track record of executive leadership within the utility industry, have demonstrated ability to execute on the regulatory front, leading operational and financial discipline and impeccable credibility with external stakeholders. And we always anticipated a three- to six-month time line. I can share that interest has been strong. The process has been quite active since the beginning of the year and discussions among the Board and select candidates continue. The Board is committed to selecting the right individual to lead our talented team, and we trust you will respect the process through its conclusion.We look forward to sharing the announcement when the Board completes its work. In the meantime, we continue to execute on the strategy we have in place. The Board and the management team are fully committed to this path and the expectation is that the new CEO, once name, will be as well. It's an exciting time for FirstEnergy as we're poised to leverage our many strengths from our diverse assets to the transformation that has taken place since 2020 to the talented employees who are making the Company stronger with their drive, passion and ingenuity. I appreciate your continued support. We are concentrating our efforts on long-term stability and success as a leading utility. We will continue to navigate our path with the same determined focus you've seen over the last few years.Now, I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.Jon Taylor: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I joined John in thanking our employees for their incredible work this past year. Their perseverance and commitment made it possible for us to navigate challenging conditions and make important progress on our goals. We have a busy year ahead of us as we continue driving towards our aspirations and laying additional groundwork for our future success. I'll start my remarks with a review of our top regulatory and business priorities. Then we'll move to a discussion of 2022 financial results and 2023 expectations. We have an active regulatory calendar this year. Later this quarter, we'll file for new distribution rates in New Jersey and Maryland and file an application to consolidate our Pennsylvania legal entities.Then by midyear, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia, an electric security plan in Ohio in an infrastructure investment program, or IIP in New Jersey. Broadly speaking, the rate cases will address the significant customer-focused investments we've made since our last rate cases in each of the states and provide an opportunity to bring our distribution equity returns in line with the industry average allowed returns. At the end of 2022, our weighted average ROE was 7.7% and while authorized ROEs ranged from 9.6% to 10.5%. Our current residential rates are 10% to 40% below our peers in the states we serve and we are sensitive to the pressures of the current inflationary environment on our customers. Our rate cases this year will ensure we maintain our affordability position while enhancing the customer experience, provide further support for low-income customers and support the critical investments for a more reliable, resilient and smarter electric grid.Each filing will address unique elements to better serve customers in that state. For example, the Maryland and New Jersey rate cases will highlight our plans to improve distribution reliability through incremental investments. In Maryland, we plan to file concurrently with the rate case for continuation of the electric distribution investment surcharge. And in New Jersey, our rate case will highlight our plan to file an infrastructure investment program by the middle of this year. These programs will focus on investments such as circuit resiliency and reliability, feeder sectionalization and distribution automation and substation upgrades. In West Virginia, the rate case will reflect our recently filed proposal with the commission to update depreciation rates associated with Mon Power's II coal-fired generation assets, which based on the depreciation study, would have retirement dates of 2035 and 2040.Any increase in depreciation rates would not take effect until conclusion of the upcoming base rate case. Turning to consolidation of our four Pennsylvania utilities, this is an important step to align with our new state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. This consolidation won't represent any changes in current electric rates for our Pennsylvania customers. Those will be combined as appropriate over time through future rate case activity. In Ohio, our ESP V will adjust generation procurement for non-shopping customers after the current ESP expires in May of next year. In addition, this filing will address other regulatory programs and mechanisms such as continuation of existing capital writers such as the DCR and AI.And as we extend our commitment to have a broad stakeholder dialogue, we are considering programs that support energy efficiency, low income and additional customer-related initiatives. We also look forward to advancing the $626 million Ohio grid mod Phase 2 capital investment plan, which was filed last July. If approved by the commission, grid mod will continue our work to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power, offer modern customer experiences and support emerging technologies. As we make each major regulatory filing, we'll post a convenient and comprehensive summary to our IR website. You'll find this information on the Investor Materials page of the site and a new section named regulatory corner. Turning to financial matters. Our recent agreement with Brookfield represents an excited milestone in our progress to be a premier utility with a strong financial position and sustainable long-term growth.Photo by RawFilm on UnsplashThe $3.5 billion transaction will deliver highly attractive, efficient equity financing. The transaction is structured with a $1.75 billion due at closing and aligned with our investment and financing plans an 18-month $1.75 billion note at 5.75% interest. Once the transaction closes, we intend to deploy the proceeds to further improve our credit metrics and our balance sheet targeting FFO to debt metrics of 14% to 15%. The proceeds also supported more than 10% increase in our 2024 and 2025 capital investment plans. We're using nearly $1 billion into the CapEx plan, brining our target to approximately $18 billion over the 2021 to '25 period. Through this plan, we're targeting 75% formula rate investments and more than 7% average annual rate base growth beginning in 2024.We will use NOLs and existing tax credits to offset most of the taxable gain on the transaction, resulting in an expected cash taxes of approximately $50 million. Beginning in 2023 and moving forward, we expect to be a federal cash taxpayer at approximately $200 million annually. Our agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FET triggered a deferred gain on the prior 19.9% sale that was completed in 2022. We As a result, we recognized a $752 million non-cash charge in our fourth quarter '22 GAAP results. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 and on an adjusted basis, excluding unique drivers this year, which include the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions.Fourth quarter operating earnings increased $0.09 per share or 22% compared to the same period in 2021. In our distribution business, fourth quarter results benefited from weather-related demand, along with the impact of our capital investment programs. These results nearly offset higher operating expenses, primarily associated with accelerating certain planned maintenance work, incremental reliability activities and higher material and storm costs. Total distribution deliveries increased 2%, resulting from weather that was closer to historic norms compared to the very mild fourth quarter of 2021 and increased demand from industrial customers. Residential sales increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2021, but decreased slightly on a weather-adjusted basis.Consistent with our observations on the October call, sales to residential customers remain about 3% higher than pre-pandemic levels. In the commercial sector, fourth quarter deliveries were up slightly from the prior year due to weather and decreased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers increased slightly overall in 2022, they continue to lag 2019 levels by more than 4%. Finally, sales to industrial customers increased nearly 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, led by continued recovery in the automotive, mining, fabricated metals and steel sectors. Overall, industrial sales are trending closer to pre-pandemic levels with full year 2022 sales less than 1% below 2019 and fourth quarter 2022 sales flat to 2019 levels.In our transmission business, fourth quarter results benefited from continued formula rate base growth of 9% year-over-year associated with our Energizing the Future investment program as well as lower financing costs. I want to take a quick second to recognize our transmission, supply chain and materials operations teams, who overcame significant supply chain and other issues in 2022, investing nearly $1.4 billion in projects to improve grid reliability and resiliency. For example, we successfully completed the first segment of a 64-mile transmission line rebuild that will enhance service reliability for customers in Eastern Ohio. And in Central New Jersey, construction is only on two projects that will upgrade 19 miles of transmission lines and benefit 50,000 customers.In 2023, our transmission investment plan is $1.7 billion, and we have a long project pipeline ahead of us in this premium business. And finally, our corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from the Signal Peak mining operation and lower financing costs associated with the holding company debt redemptions earlier this year. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share, largely reflecting the non-cash tax charge I mentioned earlier. Full year 2022 operating earnings were $2.41 per share, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Again, on an adjusted basis, excluding the accounting changes, Ohio rate credits and equity transactions, we achieved a $0.26 improvement in operating earnings compared to 2021, which represents 12% year-over-year growth.Our solid financial performance resulted in $2.7 billion in cash from operations last year, which is in line with our expectations, and we made more than $3.2 billion in customer-focused regulated investments and plan to execute our 2023 capital investment plan of $3.4 billion. And we met our 2022 FFO to debt target, executed our financing plan and achieved investment-grade credit ratings with Fitch and just recently received a positive outlook from S&amp;P. The materials posted to our website yesterday afternoon contain an updated financial outlook through 2025, including our capital plan, load forecast and financing plan. It's our expectation that we will extend our outlook beyond 2025 later this year. As John mentioned, our 2023 earnings guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share reflects overcoming the enormous challenge we face related to the pension, which year-over-year was a $0.38 impact to our 2023 plan.The combination of accelerating O&amp;M into 2022 together with lower interest expense resulting from debt reductions and earnings from Signal support our projection for 6% growth year-over-year at the guidance midpoint. Our focus is executing on our plan to drive strong regulated earnings growth, resulting in our long-term 6% to 8% growth outlook, anchored by increasing transmission and distribution utility investments. While pension and the positive offset provided in the near term by Signal Peak have complicated our earnings story, we are laser-focused as a management team to improve the earnings quality over time by replacing earnings from the Signal Peak and pension with high-quality core T&amp;D earnings growth and the significant benefits associated with improving our balance sheet.In terms of other 2023 drivers, our expectation is for the continued strong growth from the investments we're making for our 6 million customers in our distribution and transmission businesses and an improvement in our cost structure, driven in part by the work we accelerated into 2022, but this is certainly an area we will need to keep an eye on with respect to inflationary pressures. And ending on another positive note, we are fresh off a recent Board meeting, where we discuss the importance of the dividend to our investors. The Board approved a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratio to 60% to 70% up from 55% to 65% previously. And we also expect to resume dividend growth subject to Board approval for dividends payable late this year.Our new payout ratio is more in line with our peers, and reflects the steps we've taken to improve our credit profile and our commitment to enhancing value for investors. And as I mentioned on Friday, S&amp;P moved First Energy to a positive outlook based on the announcement of the asset sale and our strategy to use those proceeds in a credit supportive manner. We're pleased with this action, which recognize our work to deliver on our commitments. I'm excited about our plans for this year and for the future. We've taken significant steps over the past few years in a broad range of areas to move the Company forward from the cultural changes, the improvement of our financial and credit profile and the execution on our regulatory strategy focused on benefiting our customers.We feel like we have great momentum for the future focused on delivering value for our customers, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Before we take your questions, I'm going to turn the call back over to John.John Somerhalder: Thanks, John. We'll have plenty of time for your questions, but I wanted to take another opportunity to say how pleased I am with FirstEnergy's progress. As you've heard this morning, this team has delivered on our goals. They have diligently executed our plan, and they have exemplified our commitment to performance excellence. I'm proud of where we are as a company, and I'm excited about our future. Now, let's open to Q&amp;A.See also 15 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks and 13 Stocks Big Short Michael Burry is Buying and Selling.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL.Upgraded Broker Ratings Make These 3 Stocks Worth Buying in 2023The year 2023 started on a positive note as the Federal Reserve's ultra-aggressive monetary tightening resulted in the cooling down of inflation. But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high til inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Kroger Co., Expedia Group, Inc. and Ralph Lauren Corp. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies' publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are three stocks that qualified for the screening:Cincinnati, OH-based Kroger operates supermarkets under banners including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Harris Teeter, Jay C, King Soopers, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's. Further, KR manufactures and processes certain food products sold in its supermarkets.Story continuesThe company's earnings for fiscal 2024 are expected to increase 1.9%. Kroger, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2, has witnessed a 6.3% upward revision in broker ratings over the past four weeks.Headquartered in Seattle, WA, Expedia is one of the largest online travel companies in the world. EXPE's web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases and travel experience sharing, thus bringing suppliers and consumers of travel-related services together.Expedia's 2023 earnings are projected to rise 36.2%. The company, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present, has witnessed a 5% upward revision in broker ratings over the past four weeks.Ralph Lauren, based in New York, is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products.

40,bdeefe4a-d44c-3de3-b89b-7b057ccd294e,RL,2023-02-18,"Crocs, Inc. (CROX) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crocs-inc-crox-hit-52-141502175.html,1676643302,STORY,"['CROX', 'RL']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Crocs (CROX)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $143.5 in the previous session. Crocs has gained 21% since the start of the year compared to the 14% move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 4.9% return for the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 16, 2023, Crocs reported EPS of $2.65 versus consensus estimate of $2.18 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.77%.For the current fiscal year, Crocs is expected to post earnings of $10.69 per share on $3.94 billion in revenues. This represents a -2.11% change in EPS on a 10.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $12.11 per share on $4.34 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.26% and 9.92%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCrocs may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Crocs has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 13X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.3X versus its peer group's average of 8.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.82. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Crocs currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Crocs fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Crocs shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does CROX Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of CROX have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL). RL has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. Ralph Lauren Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 15.12%, and for the current fiscal year, RL is expected to post earnings of $9.21 per share on revenue of $6.37 billion.Shares of Ralph Lauren Corporation have gained 4.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 15.27X and a P/CF of 10.07X.The Textile - Apparel industry is in the top 37% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CROX and RL, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Moody's investors that purchase the stock on or after the 23rd of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.77 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.08 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Moody's has a trailing yield of approximately 1.0% on its current stock price of $301.45. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Moody's's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Moody's has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Moody's Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Moody's paying out a modest 37% of its earnings.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Moody's earnings per share are up 7.4% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Moody's has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Moody's worth buying for its dividend? Moody's has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Moody's more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Moody's for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Moody's (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

42,7a22ff64-e07c-3d5d-abb5-b53f82d26a46,MRO,2023-02-18,Analysts Have Just Cut Their Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) Revenue Estimates By 11%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-cut-marathon-oil-121430511.html,1676722470,STORY,['MRO'],"[The analysts covering Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for this year. There was a fairly draconian cut to their revenue estimates, perhaps an implicit admission that previous forecasts were much too optimistic.Following the latest downgrade, the 15 analysts covering Marathon Oil provided consensus estimates of US$7.2b revenue in 2023, which would reflect a noticeable 5.0% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to tumble 39% to US$3.46 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$8.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.75 in 2023. It looks like analyst sentiment has fallen somewhat in this update, with a measurable cut to revenue estimates and a minor downgrade to earnings per share numbers as well. See our latest analysis for Marathon Oil earnings-and-revenue-growthAnalysts made no major changes to their price target of US$33.87, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Marathon Oil's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Marathon Oil at US$48.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$23.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 5.0% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 4.2% over the last five years. Yet aggregate analyst estimates for other companies in the industry suggest that industry revenues are forecast to decline 5.7% per year.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Marathon Oil. Unfortunately they also trimmed their revenue estimates, although the company is expected to perform at about the same rate as the wider market this year. Overall, given the drastic downgrade to this year's forecasts, we'd be feeling a little more wary of Marathon Oil going forwards.Still, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Marathon Oil going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.Another way to search for interesting companies that could be  reaching an inflection point is to track whether management are buying or selling, with our free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Have feedback on this article?

""Everyone needed web space, everyone needed a big data plan, and everyone needed AI. People are thinking about those costs now as a concern. There was so much free money floating around for private equity companies that they could just invest in whatever they wanted. That's all stopped.""One area of tech that has continued to see a lot of movement has been in AI stocks, as the rise of ChatGPT and the so-called AI wars between Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) makes headlines.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.However, Tchir was skeptical about how far the hype surrounding AI has gone.""I think we've got to see where this plays out,"" Tchir said. ""It doesn't feel like the barriers to entry are that high. Clearly, we saw the other day— I think it was Google — their AI disappointed, and all of a sudden, their stock got hit very hard. So, too much is being built into AI right now.""And it's not just the tech sector that could fall under substantial pressure in 2023, Tchir noted. The broader market may start to feel a recessionary vibe in the economy.""I think at some point, we are going to break last year's lows on the S&amp;P and Nasdaq,"" he said, adding that for the Nasdaq, in particular, ""we are going to go through that because everyone kind of got bullish again, and we're going to realize, oops, this is not as good.""""Consumers aren't spending as much as people thought,"" he emphasized. ""Companies are still overburdened. We're going to see that pressure point.""So, from an investing perspective, are there any areas of the market that look good right now?Story continues""I like things like cable, telecom, things that people are going to need every single day,"" Tchir said.

Our tech editor Dan Howley here to discuss this. Dan, some are calling it a last-ditch effort from Microsoft. What are your expectations?DAN HOWLEY: That's right. This is kind of their move where they're trying to defend that $69 billion attempted acquisition of Activision Blizzard in front of the EU. It'll be a closed-door hearing, and essentially what they're going to do is try to say, look, we recognize that there are some complaints about the possible acquisition, whether that's as far as opportunities go for competition, but we're going to give XYZ assurances.So some of those are that it's willing to offer Sony, its chief rival in the gaming space, access to the ""Call of Duty"" franchise for 10 years. And, you know, this is something they've already done with Nintendo. Nintendo has agreed to that. Problem is ""Call of Duty"" isn't really a Nintendo game, so it's kind of meaningless overall. I don't think a lot of people-- well, you can't fire up ""Call of Duty"" on a Switch right now. It just can't handle it.So it really comes down to Sony, and this entire argument is based on, you know, what company gets control of ""Call of Duty."" Yes, Activision Blizzard has ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo,"" a number of other games. They're also the owners of the King mobile business with ""Candy Crush"" under that. So, you know, they have other games, but it's really ""Call of Duty,"" and the reason for that is because it's just a cash cow for them.When the most recent version came out, it exceeded a billion dollars in sales in 10 days. They also have their free-to-play ""Call of Duty-- Warzone."" They're also coming out with a mobile version of that as well. And while those are free, there are in-game transactions that do do particularly well for Activision Blizzard.Story continuesSo it's all about who gets to have ""Call of Duty."" And so Microsoft's plan would likely be to put that on its Game Pass service and make that cloud offering more appealing to consumers. They don't touch Sony as far as overall gaming revenue or Tencent, which those are the number one and two. But what they're trying to do is build out their cloud capabilities so that they're secure for the future and they get ahead of everyone else. And, frankly, they're doing that right now. You know, they do have the market share as far as cloud goes.How this goes, though, for them as far as Activision Blizzard, I mean, it's really up in the air. We have the FTC knocking on the door as well. So it's not looking too too good for Microsoft.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Dan Howley, should be an interesting situation. Thank you, my friend.]"
53,48cadcde-fd1f-3de0-88c0-6ef69a27b5ec,SIG,2023-02-18,4 Low P/CF Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio for Optimum Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-p-cf-stocks-143802939.html,1676644682,STORY,"['TPH', 'CMLS', 'SIG']","[Market pundits do not expect any drastic change in the economic scenario, at least in the first half of 2023. While the Fed’s recent action to lower the magnitude of the rate hike came as a breather, worries about a slowing economy prevail. So, while you modify your portfolio to cope with the changing market scenario and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks, but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. TPH and Cumulus Media Inc. CMLS boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8% for three-five years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Signet has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 44.8%, on average. SIG has a Value Score of A.

MCHP, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Xcel Energy Inc. XEL, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Amid Market VolatilityAfter a strong comeback from last year's steep losses, the U.S. stocks lost momentum lately on uncertain Fed rate hike plans and recession fears. This has raised the appeal of dividend investing once again. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Xcel Energy Inc., Cardinal Health Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.9%.

The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for this year, with an expected earnings growth rate of 6.31%.Xcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Ohio-based Cardinal Health is a nation-wide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers.

Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Microchip Technology Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Xcel Energy Inc., Cardinal Health Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 32 stocks that fit the bill:Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

57,fb6715b3-fad2-3d15-b786-835e3d35e075,ADM,2023-02-18,5 Stocks to Keep an Eye on Following Upgrade by Brokers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-keep-eye-following-125812193.html,1676638692,STORY,['ADM'],"[The hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than anticipated in January, has highlighted the fact that we are far from being out of the woods and that inflation remains a formidable foe. CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise.The Fed, which raised interest rates by 25 basis points a few days ago, has vowed to continue with its interest rate hiking strategy to curb high inflationary pressure.  The latest report indicates that further rate hikes are necessary in this respect. Higher interest rates shoot up the cost of borrowing, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.Inflationary woes have primarily resulted in extreme market volatility. Despite the current turmoil and economic uncertainty, shunning equities is an absolute no-no for investors. So what’s the way forward to reap handsome returns from one’s portfolio even during the current uncertainty?One way to proceed in this scenario is by adhering to broker advice. By following this method, broker-friendly stocks like, Archer Daniels ADM, Delek US Holdings DK, Beazer Homes USA BZH, AmerisourceBergen ABC and Avnet AVT should be included in an investor’s watchlist for healthy returns.Why is Broker Advice the Need of the Hour?As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to much-detailed information on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. Naturally, their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.Story continuesGiven this extensive know-how, brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing, equipped with thorough knowledge and a clear insight into the details pertaining to the investment world. Paying heed to such well-researched information is, therefore, logical for investors to avoid the unfortunate scenario of one’s hard-earned money invested in stock markets going down the drain.Making the Most of Broker KnowhowThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a promising basket of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is considered in designing a winning portfolio of stocks. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy extremely effective.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels: This Chicago, IL-based leading agricultural products player’s leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials is a contributor to its momentum. ADM’s focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a key driver.Archer Daniels’ Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit are aiding results. ADM has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars, which are optimize, drive and growth, for a while. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 6.7% upward over the past 60 days. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Brentwood, TN-based Delek US Holdings is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

The average beat is in excess of 100%.Beazer Homes: This Atlanta, GA-based homebuilder designs, builds and sells single-family homes.

This depicts analysts’ optimism about the company’s prospects.AmerisourceBergen is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies.

Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the company in the quarters to come.ABC has seen an upward estimate revision of 1.2% for current-year earnings over the past 60 days.

Analysts have said customers are protecting their holidays despite rising inflation and recession fears.Airports are already taking steps to prepare for high season travel. Earlier this week, Schiphol said it was considering reducing the number of passengers it could accept during the May vacation period by around 5%.In Canada, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Friday he is taking steps to avoid a repeat of last summer's gridlock at the country’s largest airports, such as by introducing proposals this spring to strengthen Canada's air passenger bill of rights.“The experience that Canadians saw last summer was really frustrating,” Alghabra told reporters in Montreal. “There are some vulnerabilities in the system that need to be addressed.”Officials at Canada's largest airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport, were not immediately available for comment.Montreal-Trudeau International Airport is adding services designed to curb lines ahead of spring break, such as bolstering an online booking platform that lets passengers schedule a specific time to pass through security checkpoints, said airport authority spokesperson Eric Forest.In the United States, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines Co expect to restore their traffic to 2019 levels this year. Southwest, which faced criticism over an operational meltdown in December, told a Senate hearing earlier this month that the carrier would be able to operate its published flight schedules.

On that day, Goldman Sachs is projected to report earnings of $8.48 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 21.19%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.22 billion, up 2.21% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $32.64 per share and revenue of $50.29 billion, which would represent changes of +8.58% and +6.17%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs.

However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%.The fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $25.8 million.The year-over-year decline was driven by the announcement of the launch of Revio in the fourth quarter, which impacted orders and shipments for Sequel IIe.Full-year revenues were $128.3 million, reflecting a 1.7% decline from the comparable 2021 period.Our projection of full-year revenues was $126.8 million.Geographical AnalysisPacBio’s revenues from the Americas were $12 million, which declined by 36% year over year.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePacific Biosciences of California, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. QuoteMargin TrendIn the quarter under review, PacBio’s adjusted gross profit fell 46.7% to $9 million. Adjusted gross margin contracted a huge 1405 basis points to 33%.We had projected a 31.1% of adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter.Sales, general and administrative expenses rose 22.3% to $45 million. Research and development expenses rose 0.1% year over year to $42.6 million. Adjusted total operating expenses of $87.6 million climbed 10.4% year over year.The adjusted total operating loss totaled $78.6 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted total operating loss of $62.4 million.Financial PositionPacBio exited the full-year 2022 with cash, cash equivalents and investments (excluding short-term and long-term restricted cash) of $772.3 million compared with $1.04 billion at the end of 2021.GuidancePacBio has initiated its financial outlook for 2023.The company expects to achieve revenues in the range $165 million to $180 million, representing growth of 29-40% from comparable 2022 figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $178.3 million.Our TakePacBio exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues. The company saw a robust increase in its Consumables revenues during the reported quarter. Robust performance in the Asia-Pacific region is also encouraging. Continued strong prospects for the company’s Revio and Onso systems, with customers placing orders for them, looks promising for the stock. The recent launch of the Paraphrase tool, which was confirmed during the fourth-quarter earnings call, augurs well. PacBio has entered into a few collaborations over the past few months, which looks promising.Yet, dismal top-line and bottom-line results are disappointing. The year-over-year fall in both Service and other revenues and product revenues is concerning. The fall in Instrument revenues and continued adjusted loss per share incurred by the company are also worrying. Lower revenues from the Americas and EMEA are worrying. The contraction of the adjusted gross margin does not bode well. The year-over-year operating loss for the company is another area of concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksPacBio currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

An improvement in overall top-line and bottom-line results and robust domestic revenues are impressive. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures is promising. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures is encouraging as well. The robust performance of Nevro’s new AI-powered HFX iQ Spinal Cord Stimulation System in the limited market release with positive feedback from physicians and patients raises optimism about the stock.In January, Nevro announced the presentation of favorable complete 24-months PDN RCT trial data and the 12-month Quality of Life RCT data, which raises optimism about the stock.On the flip side, lower-than-expected earnings in the reported quarter and dismal bottom-line performances are disappointing. Lower international revenues on a reported basis are discouraging as well. The sustained operating loss incurred by Nevro also raises our apprehension. The contraction of the gross margin also does not bode well.

In Clinical Solutions, revenues declined due to lower net awards and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher reimbursable expenses.

The fourth-quarter decline in revenues was mainly the result of lower COVID-related sales compared with the year-ago period as well as continuing supply chain constraints.On a positive note, on a geographic basis, the company experienced double-digit currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in the Americas and Asia, while Europe posted a more modest increase, primarily reflecting ongoing supply chain constraints for diagnostic products.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBio-Rad currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

(HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-140002244.html,1676642402,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -57.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -38.5%. This estimate has changed +7.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +7.6% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $968.55 million indicates a year-over-year change of -32.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.12 billion estimates indicate -18.4% and +3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The gross margin expanded 28 basis points (bps) to 43.6%.Story continuesExpenses on salaries and benefits rose 5.5% to $132 million. Other expenses rose 13.3% to $60.9 million. The adjusted operating profit of $52 million reflected a 17.7% decline from the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted 205 bps to 9.3% from the prior-year level.Liquidity and Cash PositionAmedisys exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 million compared with $42.7 million at the 2021-end. The company's long-term obligations (excluding the current portion) were $419.4 million at the end of 2022, compared with $432.1 million at the end of 2021.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of 2022 was $133.3 million compared with $188.9 million a year ago.2023 OutlookAmedisys initiated its financial guidance for 2023.The company anticipates net service revenues for the full year to be in the range of $2.24 billion-$2.27 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.37 billion.The adjusted EPS is projected in the range of $4.13-$4.36.

Recently, Amedisys signed an agreement to divest their Personal Care segment (excluding Florida operations), to HouseWorks, a Massachusetts-based personal care service provider. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.Our TakeAmedisys ended the fourth quarter with better-than-expected earnings and revenues.However, a year-over-year decline in the Hospice segment’s revenues does not bode well. For the company, dealing with the continuous shortage of clinical labor, nursing in particular, has been challenging. Mounting costs and expenses and the contraction in the adjusted operating margin are other downsides.In 2023, Amedisys remains confident about generating approximately $50 million in revenues from Contessa Health, the company’s newly formed high-acuity segment, driven by increased volumes from their current and signed JV partners.The company has kept several growth opportunities in its pipeline. These include progress in direct relationships with health systems, partnering with a leading comprehensive care at-home provider and health plans interested in value-based arrangements for in-home services.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAmedisys currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.The company’s management stated that it continues to witness strength across the entire Shockwave franchise and geographies.

The company’s 2023 revenues are likely to be driven by robust demand for existing products, coupled with launch of C2+ coronary product in the United States, which was approved in December.Q4 HighlightsDuring the quarter, Shockwave Medical received FDA clearance for its Shockwave C2+ Coronary IVL Catheter, a bit ahead of schedule.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details. We know there's been a lot of back and forth online about this.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, Rachelle, and I received dozens of messages from concerned Netflix users. Netflix has said that what's been released so far in regards to the password sharing crackdown is only applicable to the announced country. So remember that nothing has happened in the US just yet. But countries like Canada, Spain, Portugal, Costa Rica, among others, are currently in the midst of this crackdown.So here are some of the biggest concerns from our viewers and readers. Jeff K. Writing, quote, ""I understand Netflix's desire to stop five friends that don't live together sharing one account login, but that is how they built their business. Families with children away at university would be considered part of the household under the Stats Can definition, since their primary residence is still with their parents.""Now, that is not necessarily true, because Netflix defines a household as those that actually live within it. So that could be roommates, it could be a family. But if you have kids that are studying at college, that are away from that primary residence, under the terms of Netflix's rules in Canada where this viewer is from, that child would have to pay for a separate account, or the primary account holder could add up to two outside members for an extra $7.99 CAD a month per person.Another concern here came from Eric W. He wrote, quote, ""I stay at three other locations besides my home each month. This Netflix agreement is reducing my livelihood and subjecting me to hardship. Netflix has made new agreements with actors and film production companies and piggybacking on consumers to pay for their deals through these agreements.""Story continuesNow, if you are a snowbird and have multiple homes, you can, in fact, change your primary location through the Netflix app. So that is not an issue. You could also travel and watch Netflix from your hotel with particular access codes. So it seems like Netflix does not want to make it harder for the actual account holder to access their subscription.And then finally, one more point here from Amanda G. She wrote to me, quote, ""If the policy change makes it that we would have to pay full price for a subscription, we would not add the service. The reality is, each subscription service provides limited options at this point, and frankly, I believe people will be returning to illegal downloads. Netflix was a draw because it meant we could get rid of our overpriced cable service. At this point, by needing multiple streaming services, it will end up as being as expensive as cable.""She understands that the business wants to make a profit, but she does believe that at the end of the day, this is going to be a net negative. And this has been a continuous concern among subscribers, given how many services are currently on the market. So a lot of questions right now. Very few answers. But definitely something to keep an eye on as we get closer and closer to that crackdown in the US.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It'll be interesting to see how Netflix reacts to the results that they've seen and the backlash already before it even gets to the US, to see if they make any changes or if they just go ahead and roll out with this. But a lot of people still have questions. And thank you for answering all of those for us there. Ali Canal, thanks so much.]"

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Hecla is the world's fastest-growing established silver miner, surprising for a 130-year-old company. And I'm on Slide 4. There are 4 reasons that this is happening. First, Hecla's commitment to silver. Since our founding, Hecla has always been a silver producer even when other metals and activities provided more margin. When I joined Hecla in 2001, investors and others encouraged us to sell or close our silver assets. But what I saw was that our large resource position can survive the ups and downs of the silver market. And we needed to be committed because the silver market would improve. And of course, it did. And because of silver's role as an energy metal, we think the silver market will strengthen further.Story continuesI'm going to talk more about that at the end of our prepared remarks. The second reason for our industry-leading growth is the foundation that came in 2008 when we purchased the 70% of Greens Creek we didn't own. This acquisition increased our silver reserves by 2.5x and provided the base and cash flow stream to further invest in the mines and others into that mine and other mines, including the Lucky Friday. And then the third reason is the investment in Lucky Friday has ultimately resulted in a new mining method, the underhand closed bench, or UCB, that is transforming this 80-year-old mine with a safer, more productive mining method that with higher grades allows it to double its historic silver production. And now the fourth reason for the growth is Keno Hill.In just 4 months since the acquisition, Keno's reserves are 1/3 higher and we produce about 2.5 million silver ounces this year and in excess of 4 million next year. Looking at the chart on the left, silver reserves are almost 5x where they were at the start of 2008 despite having produced more than 200 million ounces since then. Combining what has been replaced with the increase in reserve, Hecla has added 400 million ounces over the last 15 years. So we have 4 bodies that grow. To grow reserves and production, our strategy since 2008 has focused on large prospective land positions in the U.S. and Canada. And for a long time, the market didn't differentiate between jurisdictions, but we stayed the course with strategy. And today, whether analyst reviews reflect that the market clearly values being in the best jurisdictions, and we are in the best jurisdictions.Now looking at the chart on the right, from 2008 to 2012, we produced about 9 million ounces per year. Then we increased the average by about 50%, giving us a decade of about 12.5 million ounces. And now, we're having another 50% increase in silver production to 18 million ounces. Realize that we only show 3 years because we've not put together a long-term plan for Keno. But I expect that we'll stay at this 18 million ounces or more from these 3 mines for at least a decade. 2022 had the highest production in our history in 2023, '24, '25 and I think we're all going to set new production records for the company. And this growth doesn't require significant capital investment. Russell is going to talk about how we have the balance sheet and silver margins to achieve this and position us for even more growth.Russell?Russell Lawlar: Thanks, Phil. I'll start on Slide 6. The double-digit production growth we see -- we expect to see is being funded by our industry-leading silver margins, which have averaged more than 50% of the realized price of silver over the past few years. The direct result of these margins is the significant free cash flow generation we have seen over the past 3 years where our mines have generated more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow, including Casa Berardi's contribution of about $85 million from 2020 to 2022. In 2022, we made the decision to deploy this free cash flow in capital projects and larger equipment at the Lucky Friday mine, where we invested approximately $50 million. The acquisition of Alexco in which we've made equity investments in the loan earlier in the year of about $35 million and then an additional $20 million in development at the Keno Hill mine after the acquisition.We also invested $46 million in exploration and predevelopment programs in 2022. We did this while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet. On Slide 7, revenue for 2022 was $719 million, 39% from gold; 34% from silver; and 27% from base metals. Revenue in 2022 declined year-over-year due to lower silver prices and lower gold production with our Nevada operations on care and maintenance. Despite the lower realized prices, free cash flow generation from the 3 mines was approximately $110 million for the year, while our 2022 adjusted EBITDA declined $218 million due to the lower revenue and inflation-driven costs. Our net leverage ratio continued to be below our target of 2x. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet with $105 million in cash.We also monetized some long-term zinc hedges for approximately $17 million as zinc prices declined in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility in executing our plans. I'll now turn the call to Lauren.Metal, Mining, IndustryPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashLauren Roberts: Thanks, Russell. I will start on Slide 9. Greens Creek had another remarkable year. The mine produced 9.7 million ounces of silver seeing our guidance. Record throughput of 2,500 tons per day was achieved in the fourth quarter. In the time since we acquired full ownership of Greens Creek in 2008, and the mine's throughput has increased 20% from 2,000 tons per day to 2,415 tons per day. Equally impressive is that the recovery rate for each metal also increased during this period. Looking forward, we will continue our production ramp-up during the year and expect to achieve 2,600 tons per day in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter ASIC was higher compared to the third quarter due to higher treatment and freight costs because a silver concentrate shipment was deferred from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we conducted some seasonal maintenance activities to prepare for winter.The mine generated $120 million in free cash flow and nearly $1.9 billion in free cash flow since the mine started operations in 1989. Silver production guidance for 2023 is in line with 2022 at 9 million to 9.5 million ounces silver. Cash costs are expected to be lower at $0 to $0.25 per ounce, while the silver all-in sustaining cost is higher at $6 to $6.75 per ounce primarily due to equipment purchases and increased development as we target 2,600 tons per day. Moving to Slide 10. Lucky Friday reported a record year as the mine achieved operational milestones, including record tons processed and the highest silver production in the past 20 years. We also ratified a 6-year contract with the union, which reflects our strong working relationship and gives us the stability to continue to optimize the mine for further production growth.Silver production for the year was 4.4 million ounces. The UCB mining method is delivering impressive safety performance and production milestones at the mine. In 2022, we saw a 25% reduction in all incident frequency rate, an 11% increase in ore tons produced and a new all-time record for feet of development by company crews. Mill also is performing extremely well, delivering new all-time quarterly and annual throughput records as well as the largest ever year of zinc production. Just to put things in perspective, there has been a 68% increase in ore production since 2016, which was the last full year of production used in the previous mining method. Mine is expected to produce 4.5 million to 5 million ounces of silver in 2023 at all-in sustaining cost of $8.50 to $9.50 per ounce.Capital spend for the year will be in the range of $48 million to $51 million related to the remaining growth capital associated with the production expansion and infill drilling to support the UCB production method. 2022 marked many significant milestones to the transformation of this mine which began more than a decade ago with the sinking of the #4 shaft to access the high-grade ore we're mining today. of this success is coming from our peers as well. Lucky Friday is a recipient of the 2022 Society of Mining Engineers Murray Innovation Award for the pioneering UCB method. As I look ahead, I am more convinced than ever that the best decade of this 80-year-old mine is ahead of it, and I could not be more proud of the team leading this effort, and I am very grateful for the scores of others who have contributed to it over the years.Turning to Slide 11. Casa Berardi produced approximately 31,000 ounces of gold for the quarter and 128,000 ounces during the year. Mill continues to perform very well, achieving new throughput records. However, challenging underground mining conditions resulted in a high proportion of lower grade open pit ore to satisfy the mill. All-in sustaining cost for the year was $1,825 per gold ounce, exceeding our guidance due to lower metal production and higher production costs, driven by inflationary pressures. Casa Berardi is more exposed to inflation than our other mines because it moves and processes more material than all of our silver mines combined and there is no appreciable byproduct credit. However, even with these challenges in capital investment, the mine was near breakeven in cash flow.Our 2023 gold production guidance for the mine is reduced to 110,000 to 115,000 ounces of gold. This change reflects adjustments made to cutoff grades for inflation, fewer underground tons and more open pit tons as per the mine plan. All-in sustaining costs from the mine are expected to be $1,975 to $2,050 per ounce, higher than 2022, primarily due to lower gold production and higher sustaining capital associated with the expansion of the tailings facility. Casa Berardi remains an important asset in our portfolio that gives us scale, exposure to gold production, and exploration potential on a large and under-explored land package on the Casa Berardi break. At Keno Hill, we increased reserves by 33% to 49 million ounces of silver at 22 ounces per ton, among the highest in the world.Keno Hill would be the largest and highest grade primary gold -- primary silver mine in Canada. Development at the Birmingham and Flame &amp; Moth deposits are on track with the mill starting in the third quarter and full production of 440 tons per day achieved by year-end. Our guidance for 2023 production is 2.5 million to 3 million ounces of silver at an all-in sustaining cost of $12.25 to $14.75 per ounce. Capital spend for the year is estimated to be $42 million to $44 million as we continue development, receive more equipment and complete our mill and surface infrastructure projects. While we are laser focused on development and getting Keno Hill into full production, our confidence in the exploration potential of this district continues to grow.Moving to Slide 13. We have significant exploration success drilling 3 of our many underexplored targets. Some highlights from the program include 101 silver ounces per ton over 7 feet at Coral Wigwam, 10 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Hector-Calumet; and 19 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Silver King. These results demonstrate the strong exploration and discovery potential in the district. With this, I'll pass the call back to Phil.Phillips Baker: Thanks, Lauren. Just to comment on the exploration at Keno. When we announced the Alexco acquisition, Alexco asks if they should continue to explore, which they had a requirement to do so in either '22 or '23 because of funding. And so while, as Lauren said, our first priority was given the mine into full and consistent production, we allowed them to go ahead and continue that exploration program. And then, of course, we continued it once we closed the acquisition. We're really glad that they went forward with the program because this clearly shows that Keno has the potential to grow dramatically. Now if you'll turn to Slide 14 for our 3-year production guidance. We expect our silver production this year to increase 18% over '22 and continue to increase to as much as 20 million ounces in 2025, Keno with production between 2.5 million and 3 million ounces in Lucky Friday.That 4.5 million to 5 million drives the growth. Our consolidated silver all-in sustained cost is expected to come in approximately $10.25 to $11.50 after by-product credits. So that's consistent with where we were this past year. At today's prices, we see about $150 million of free cash flow that we're going to invest in exploration, pay dividends, maintain our land positions and invest in Casa. As Lauren noted, we've made some hard decisions to change our underground mine plant at Casa Berardi, where we've increased the cutoff grade, lower gold production, but by mining less marginal material and lowering our costs. So this year's gold production will be between 160,000 and 170,000 ounces about 110,000 to 115,000 ounces for Casa. And then we'll have a further decline to about 145,000 ounces next year for the company.With less production, all-in sustaining costs are expected to increase this year to around $2,000 per gold ounce. So we're going to make an investment net of about $20 million into Casa, so negative cash free cash flow at Casa. I realize that in the past 10 years, we've only had one other year that we've had negative free cash flow. So this is just a period of time we're more going to be investing in the tailings. We're going to be investing in surface mine infrastructure before we put the higher grade pits into production, which is going to lower the ASIC and the Casa free cash flow generating. We've changed the plan at Casa to improve the economics over 5 years, not as good economics currently, but better economics over a longer period of time.If you look at our total capital for the company, it's about $200 million, and it's split pretty evenly among the 4 operations. We also expect to invest more than $30 million in exploration predevelopment with the focus on Greens Creek for us to expand the reserves and resources. Casa Berardi on the underground targets to identify higher grade mineralization and at Keno Hill. And lastly, we're going to be focused on Keno's ramp-up, which we anticipate will cost approximately $9 million. So before we end our prepared remarks, I want to leave you all with a number, $1.1 trillion, and this is on Slide 15. The reason this number is significant is it's the amount that has been invested this past year in fossil fuels and also the same amount has been invested in renewables.And this is the first time ever this has happened. In the past, fossil fuel investment eclipsed renewables. No more. 2022 is really the tipping point. And since solar represents the fastest growing component of renewables, and it takes 0.5 million silver ounces for every gigawatt of solar panels that are installed, the appetite for silver is going to grow. So finally, I want to mention the remarkable safety performance we had in 2022. Our all-in frequency rate was 1.22 among the lowest in our history. And this operational and safety success is made possible only with the commitment and dedication of our employees. And with that, Regina, I'd like to open the call to questions.See also 12 Countries that Make the Best Whiskey and 12 Countries that Produce the Most Cars.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Interest in coal stocks waned so much that the VanEck Vectors coal ETF (KOL), the only coal ETF in the U.S., stopped trading after more than a decade of being active.Investment giants like Blackrock BLK have pushed for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and have promised to reduce investments in companies that produce emissions. Meanwhile, clean energy has taken a bigger slice of the pie, and energy solutions such as solar have become more efficient in recent years.Expect the UnexpectedWall Street is never obvious. Knowing what occurred over the past decade, one would think that very few if any coal stocks would be in business, let alone performing well. However, that is exactly what is happening. Over the past two years, coal stocks have remained in business and quietly became market leaders and some of the top performing stocks in the entire market. For example, since 2021, public coal producers such as Arch Resources Inc ARCH have gained 283%, while Alpha Metallurgical Resources AMR is up a mind-blowing 1,097%!Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat is Driving the Stellar Performance?Coal stocks not only have scorching hot performance but are also highly ranked. The coal industry ranks 19 out of the 251 industries tracked by Zacks, putting it in the top 8%. Arch Resources, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP, and Warrior Met Coal HCC hold a best possible Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while a handful of peers such as Peabody Energy BTU earn #2 (Buy) ranks. Coal stocks are benefitting from a variety of factors, including:Story continuesClean Energy is not Enough to Meet Supply Void:Despite the advent of the green energy revolution, the increase in alternative energy has not been enough to stave off increasing energy demand in recent years.Industry Consolidation: Because many weaker coal companies went out of business a few years ago, the remaining coal companies are benefiting from soaring demand.ESG:There’s a big difference between what many of the ESG proponents are saying versus doing. Contrary to the rhetoric around decreasing emissions, firms such as Blackrock, Bank of America BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, and J.P Morgan JPM, continue to invest billions of dollars in coal and other “dirty” energy.  FundamentalsThe soaring stock prices in the coal industry are not without merit. For example, Arch Resources grew EPS by 94% year-over-year in its latest quarter, while Alliance Resource Partners’ EPS vaulted more than 300%. SunCoke Energy SXC is yet another strong coal performer. Last quarter, earnings surprised by 133.33%, and the Consensus Estimate Trend has been positive over the past 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical Picture: Breakouts GaloreWhile the coal industry has seen a meteoric rise over the past two years, most names in the group have consolidated and digested in recent months. However, following recent blowout earnings, and firm EPS estimates moving forward, the coal leaders such as ARCH and HCC look poised to continue their uptrends. Both names are examples of just some of the coal stocks breaking out. On Thursday, ARCH rocketed higher by nearly 10% on volume more than double the norm. HCC is also breaking out from a multi-month base after a strong earnings report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayIndustry consolidation, strong demand, and a lack of ESG adherence is leading to strength in the coal industry. Recent earnings have been strong, expectations moving forward are robust, and multiple stocks are staging breakouts simultaneously – a confirmation signal for technicians.

From 2025 the government plans to release a new sustainable jobs plan every five years.""Canada has what it takes to become the clean energy and technology supplier of choice in a net-zero world,"" Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a news release.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been promising sustainable jobs legislation since 2019. But in Canada, the world's fourth-largest crude oil producer, the concept of retraining workers for clean energy jobs, also called a ""Just Transition"", became a lightening rod for criticism.In the crude-producing province Alberta, conservative Premier Danielle Smith has accused Trudeau of wanting to phase out the oil and gas sector.The Alberta government is ""perplexed"" by the jobs plan not mentioning a liquefied natural gas export strategy and has ""grave concerns"" about it not recognising the provinces' right to manage their own natural resources, Smith said in a statement on Friday.""This kind of dysfunctional communication by the federal government with our province cannot continue if Canada is to have any chance of achieving its 2050 emissions reduction targets,"" she said.The federal government said enormous clean energy opportunities are emerging in oil-producing provinces, from hydrogen to critical minerals. There will also be sustainable jobs in conventional energy industries as Canadian producers aim to lower the carbon intensity of their crude, according to the document.Story continues""Rather than a shortage of jobs, in Canada we are much more likely to see an abundance of sustainable jobs with a shortage of workers required to fill them,"" the plan said.Think-tanks Clean Energy Canada expects jobs in the sector will grow by 3.4% annually over the next decade, nearly four times faster than the Canadian average.On Thursday, Smith wrote to Trudeau offering to collaborate with the federal government on developing carbon capture and storage incentives, but only if Ottawa secured Alberta's consent on climate policies that affect oil and gas, including clean energy jobs legislation.

87,9284237f-76ca-3988-bfc1-397071bd1de5,GD,2023-02-18,Is There An Opportunity With General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) 29% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-140019696.html,1676642419,STORY,['GD'],"[Does the February share price for General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.71bUS$4.17bUS$4.39bUS$4.59bUS$4.87bUS$5.08bUS$5.26bUS$5.42bUS$5.57bUS$5.72bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 4.20%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.80%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$3.0kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.1%) = US$113bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$113b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$56bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$89b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$231, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.872. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Morgan Analysts Say These 3 Stocks Are Their Top Picks for 2023,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-analysts-3-163214340.html,1676651534,STORY,"['TMUS', 'ZTS', 'JNPR']","[Anyone involved in the investing game will know it’s all about “stock picking.” Choosing the right stock to put your money behind is vital to ensure strong returns on an investment. Therefore, when the Wall Street pros consider a name to be a “Top Pick,” investors should take note.Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve looked up the details on three stocks that have recently gotten ‘Top Pick’ designation from the analysts at banking giant J.P. Morgan.So, let’s dive into the details and find out what makes them so. Using a combination of market data, company reports, and analyst commentary, we can get an idea of just what makes these stocks compelling picks for 2023.Zoetis Inc. (ZTS)The first JPM pick we're looking at is a biopharmaceutical company – but with a twist. Zoetis is specializing in medicines and vaccines for veterinary purposes. We don’t often think about that, just assuming that human and veterinary drugs have a lot of overlap, but there are significant differences in active and inactive ingredients, dosages, and even delivery mechanisms. Veterinary medicine can overlap with human treatments, but it does not always, and many of its treatments and drugs are species-specific. This is the world in which Zoetis works.Veterinary care, for pets and livestock, is a huge business, with impacts on some of the most personal aspects of our lives, from the animals we take into our home to our very food supply. Zoetis regularly brings in close to $2 billion per quarter in revenues; the last quarter reported, 4Q22, showed $2 billion in revenue, and adjusted net income of $539 million, or adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15. Looking ahead, the company is projecting 2023 revenue between of $8.575 - $8.725 billion, above Street estimate of $8.55 billion.At the same time, Zoetis has kept up its small, but highly reliable dividend payment. The payment, of $0.375 cents per common share, annualizes to $1.5 and gives a yield of 1%. The company has been keeping up reliable payments for over a decade now.Story continuesAgainst this backdrop, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott lays out a reasoned explanation for keeping Zoetis as a Top Pick: “We see ZTS as well-positioned with an innovative and differentiated portfolio (derm, parasiticides, pain &amp; diagnostics) that should translate to further upside to numbers over time. And while the company had supply issues in 2022, these appear to have been largely addressed with little to no impact expected on 2023 results... We see a very attractive setup for the stock in 2023.”Seeing a sound current position, and room for future expansion, Schott rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets his price target at $225 to indicate his belief in a 31% one-year upside to the shares. (To watch Schott’s track record, click here)Overall, this veterinary medical firm gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 4 recent reviews that include 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The stock is selling for $171.64, and its $202.50 average price target implies an 18% gain by the end of this year. (See ZTS stock forecast)Juniper Networks (JNPR)We’ll now switch gears and move over to the tech sector, where Juniper Networks is specializing in the development and marketing of routers, switches, network management software, security products, and software-defined networking tech – in short, all of things that are needed to put together and maintain networking and cybersecurity solutions.Networking has become an essential business in our digital world, and Juniper has realized consistently high revenues and earnings from it. In 2022, the company has reported $5.3 billion in total revenues, up from $4.73 billion in the prior year, for a year-over-year gain of 12%.Preliminary 4Q data showed an 11% y/y gain for revenues, to $1.448 billion. The GAAP net income came to $180 million, or 55 cents per share, up 36% y/y, and by non-GAAP measures, the income of $213 million (65 cents per diluted share) was up 16% y/y. The company has deep pockets, although cash reserves are down from 2021; Juniper finished 2022 with $1.23 billion in cash and liquid assets, compared to $1.69 billion at the end of 2021. Looking ahead, Juniper guided toward a 15% y/y revenue gain for 1Q23, to approximately $1.34 billion.Of note for return-minded investors, Juniper authorized an increase of 5% for its common share dividend, starting with the March 22 payment. This brings the dividend to 22 cents per common share, or 88 cents annualized, for a 2.77% yield.Covering Juniper for JPMorgan, 5-star analyst Samik Chatterjee writes, “We see the recent earnings print further underscoring our rationale for Juniper being our Top Pick for 2023, led by the company's resilient revenue/ earnings, which we believe is supported by a large share gain opportunity in Enterprise, a robust backlog, and customer vertical diversification.”Chatterjee backs that 'share gain opportunity' with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and a $42 price target, which implies a one-year upside of ~33%. (To watch Chatterjee’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 11 analyst reviews on Juniper in recent weeks, and they break down to 5 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $31.65 and the $36.09 average target indicates room for ~14% over the next 12 months. (See Juniper stock forecast)T-Mobile US (TMUS)Last up is a company that likely doesn’t need much introduction. T-Mobile is one of the US’ largest wireless service providers, and one of the leaders in expanding 5G network coverage across the country. T-Mobile’s 5G network covers more than 325 million people in North America, mostly in the US. The company boasts nearly 2.65 million customers for high-speed internet as of Q4 2022, up 25% from Q3 – and up from just 646,000 at the end of 2021.T-Mobile reported solid gains in subscriber numbers in its 4Q22 report, adding 1.8 million postpaid net customers and 927K postpaid phone customers in the quarter. High-speed internet net customer additions came to 524,000. Overall, the company generated Q4 revenue of $20.27 billion, a 2.5% year-over-year decrease, and $390 million below consensus estimate. However, GAAP EPS jumped 247% y/y to $1.18, beating Street estimate of $1.07.Cash generation was also eye-catching. T-Mobile saw its annual free cash flow jump more than 35% y/y, from $5.65 billion in 2021 to $7.66 billion in 2022. The FCF gain was driven by a massive spike in Q4; the $2.18 billion in FCF from 4Q22 was up more than 96% y/y.These are solid numbers, according to JPMorgan analyst Phillip Cusick, who writes: “T-Mobile is our top pick for 2023 across our coverage as we see substantial synergy and operating efficiencies over the next several years driving strong EBITDA and cash flow growth.”The company’s cash flow growth potential back up Cusick’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, and his $200 price target suggests a 35% upside over the coming year. (To watch Cusick’s track record, click here)All in all, Wall Street generally was impressed by T-Mobile’s performance, and that shows in the analyst reviews. Of the 16 on file, 14 are to Buy against just 2 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s $179.92 average price target implies ~22% upside from the $147.87 trading price.

91,192cba2e-670d-398b-a657-8aad0376dd23,NRG,2023-02-18,Why NRG Energy (NRG) is a Top Dividend Stock for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nrg-energy-nrg-top-164504966.html,1676652304,STORY,['NRG'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.NRG Energy in FocusBased in Houston, NRG Energy (NRG) is in the Utilities sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 7.1%. The power company is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.43% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.18% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.57%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. Over the last 5 years, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 101.82%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 23%, meaning it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.79 per share, with earnings expected to increase 82.82% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

95,1703ba26-8b1b-3ba2-9c85-2d9536be327b,NEE,2023-02-18,7 Comeback Stocks to Buy Before They Soar Again,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-comeback-stocks-buy-soar-200056822.html,1676404856,STORY,"['NEE-PR', 'FSLY', 'PUBM', 'GEVO']","[Wall Street is slowly coming around to three ideas that I’ve advocated for months: the notion that most stocks can only go up when the Fed is cutting interest rates is ridiculous, America is not headed for a recession, and we’re likely on the verge of a bull market or already in one. The latest evidence of the Street’s new-found optimism came on Feb. 13, when Wells Fargo proclaimed that “the bear market is over.” While the firm refused to concede that we’re in a bull market or about to be in one, the fact that it’s willing to announce the demise of “the bear” is a very good sign for stocks in general and comeback stocks in particular.Comeback stocks — which I define as well-positioned growth names that tumbled sharply during the bear market — should do especially well now that the Street realizes that we can exit “the bear” while the Fed is still raising rates. That’s because, with the “don’t fight the Fed” rule discarded, big-time investors are quite likely to see that another closely related, misguided “law” — growth stocks can’t go up while the Fed is raising rates — also needs to be thrown in the dumpster. Here are seven comeback stocks that investors can use to exploit the Street’s awakening.FSLYFastly$12.96NEENextEra Energy$75.97EVGOEVgo$6.30GEVOGevo$2.04PUBMPubMatic$15.26LITGlobal X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF$68.47SPWRSunPower$15.80InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsComeback Stocks: Fastly (FSLY)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs I noted in a Feb. 13 article, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) soared after Bank of America upgraded the stock to “buy” from “underperform.” The firm noted Fastly’s “underlying fundamentals” were solid, and that it was upbeat on the changes made by its new CEO, Todd Nightengale.In 2020, I was bullish on FSLY stock, citing the innovations that the company used to make life easier for its companies’ developers, along with the extremely positive reviews that it received from many of its users. But that call turned out to be totally wrong, as a number of developments, including the bear market, caused the shares to tumble roughly 90% from their January 2021 peak. However, I believe that Nightengale’s changes, combined with improved sentiment, and the relatively low valuation of FSLY, will help FSLY make a triumphant return.Story continuesNextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockThe decline in NextEra (NYSE:NEE) should be short-lived, especially with its clean energy unit, NextEra Energy benefiting from the recent anti-climate change law.  Also noteworthy is that NEE’s Florida Power &amp; Light Company, which it described as “America’s largest electric utility.”In addition, in the fourth quarter, NEE’s revenue jumped 22% year-over-year, while its earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at 51 cents, up from 41 cents during the same period a year earlier. For all of 2022, its adjusted EPS climbed 14%. For 2023, NEE expects its adjusted EPS to be $2.98-$3.13. up from $2.90 last year. At the midpoint of that range, NEE is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 25x. Given its growth outlook and growth potential, that’s an attractive valuation.Comeback Stocks: EVgo (EVGO)EVgo fast charging stationSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comEVGo (NASDAQ:EVGO) should benefit from the rapid proliferation of EVs, government assistance, and impressive partnerships. When it comes to EV proliferation, a staggering 24.2% of all light vehicles sold in California last quarter were plug-in vehicles. The share of all-electric vehicles jumped to 21%. Of course, California is a huge market on its own, but it’s safe to assume that many other states are poised to follow California’s lead in the coming quarters and years.On the government assistance front, the U.S. Department of Transportation is poised to spend $5 billion this year on subsidizing not only the deployment of EV chargers, but also their “proper operation and maintenance.” Consequently, a huge amount of EVgo’s costs are going to be covered starting later in 2023, enabling its profitability to soar.Among EVgo’s impressive partners are General Motors (NYSE:GM), whose Bolt EVs “were the bestselling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year,” and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), a leader in the ride-hailing market.Gevo (GEVO)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comDown about 80% from its January 2021 peak, Gevo (NASDAQ:GEVO) continues to progress towards becoming a leading supplier of sustainable airline fuel. Gevo has also established multiple, impressive partnerships, including a five-year $165 million deal with Spain’s Iberia Airlines, which is expected to kick off in 2028.In addition, in October, the company announced that Qatar Airways would purchase 5 million gallons annually of SAF starting in 2028. Among Gevo’s other major, future customers are American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Ireland’s Aer Lingus. Gevo continues to expect its first major factory to open in 2025.  It also expects to generate EBITDA of $300 million to $325 million annually.PubMatic (PUBM)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7As I noted in a previous column, PubMatic’s (NASDAQ:PUBM) “cloud infrastructure platform enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions.” Amid the Street’s aversion to growth stocks and a slowdown of the growth of digital-ad spending, PUBM has tumbled 65% from its peak of $64.81, set in February 2021.However,  as I discussed in the introduction to this column, the Street’s view of growth stocks is likely to become much more favorable soon. Meanwhile, I believe that reduced spending on digital ads was largely due to fears about a recession that, barring a cataclysmic geopolitical event or a large amount of turbulence in energy markets, is not going to materialize this year or in 2024. As that reality becomes apparent to companies, the growth of digital ads should accelerate meaningfully.Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF (LIT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLithium prices will remain elevated, as demand for electric vehicle batteries soars. Those dynamics should greatly boost the Global X Lithium &amp; Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT), which has tumbled 25% from its peak of $93 set in November 2021.S&amp;P Global reports that “Lithium prices will likely see strong support in 2023, with supply expected to remain tight amid bullish demand from the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles across the globe.” Meanwhile, the global EV battery market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20% between 2022 and 2027.SunPower (SPWR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comSunPower’s (NASDAQ:SPWR) decline appears to have been sparked by California’s decision to reduce the amount that the state pays homeowners for the electricity that they provide to the state’s electricity grid. Adding to the fears was a January note on SPWR stock from Barclays, which downgraded SPWR “underweight” from “equal weight.”But I believe that the Street in general and Barclays, in particular, are greatly underestimating the impact that the combination of rising electricity prices, the proliferation of electric vehicles, and increased tax credit for solar installations will have on the residential solar market going forward. That trifecta, I believe, will dwarf the impact of California’s decision.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PUBM and EVGO.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 12.68% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.37 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.89%. In comparison, the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield is 3.07%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.57%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.48 is up 4.2% from last year. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.78%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 33%. This means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.77 per share, with earnings expected to increase 3.92% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BK is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hecla Mining Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to turn the conference over to Anvita Patil. Please go ahead.Anvita Patil: Good morning, Regina, and thank you all for joining us for Hecla's Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial and Operations Results Conference Call. I'm Anvita Patil, Hecla's Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Our financial results news release that was issued this morning, along with today's presentation, are available on Hecla's website. On today's call, we have Phil Baker, Hecla's President and CEO ; Lauren Roberts, Hecla's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Lawlar, Hecla's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Any forward-looking statements made today by the management team come under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and involve risks as shown on Slides 2 and 3 in our earnings release and in our 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC.These and other risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures cited in this call and related slides are found in the slides or the news release. With that, I'll pass the call to Phil.Phillips Baker: Thanks, Anvita. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Hecla is the world's fastest-growing established silver miner, surprising for a 130-year-old company. And I'm on Slide 4. There are 4 reasons that this is happening. First, Hecla's commitment to silver. Since our founding, Hecla has always been a silver producer even when other metals and activities provided more margin. When I joined Hecla in 2001, investors and others encouraged us to sell or close our silver assets. But what I saw was that our large resource position can survive the ups and downs of the silver market. And we needed to be committed because the silver market would improve. And of course, it did. And because of silver's role as an energy metal, we think the silver market will strengthen further.Story continuesI'm going to talk more about that at the end of our prepared remarks. The second reason for our industry-leading growth is the foundation that came in 2008 when we purchased the 70% of Greens Creek we didn't own. This acquisition increased our silver reserves by 2.5x and provided the base and cash flow stream to further invest in the mines and others into that mine and other mines, including the Lucky Friday. And then the third reason is the investment in Lucky Friday has ultimately resulted in a new mining method, the underhand closed bench, or UCB, that is transforming this 80-year-old mine with a safer, more productive mining method that with higher grades allows it to double its historic silver production. And now the fourth reason for the growth is Keno Hill.In just 4 months since the acquisition, Keno's reserves are 1/3 higher and we produce about 2.5 million silver ounces this year and in excess of 4 million next year. Looking at the chart on the left, silver reserves are almost 5x where they were at the start of 2008 despite having produced more than 200 million ounces since then. Combining what has been replaced with the increase in reserve, Hecla has added 400 million ounces over the last 15 years. So we have 4 bodies that grow. To grow reserves and production, our strategy since 2008 has focused on large prospective land positions in the U.S. and Canada. And for a long time, the market didn't differentiate between jurisdictions, but we stayed the course with strategy. And today, whether analyst reviews reflect that the market clearly values being in the best jurisdictions, and we are in the best jurisdictions.Now looking at the chart on the right, from 2008 to 2012, we produced about 9 million ounces per year. Then we increased the average by about 50%, giving us a decade of about 12.5 million ounces. And now, we're having another 50% increase in silver production to 18 million ounces. Realize that we only show 3 years because we've not put together a long-term plan for Keno. But I expect that we'll stay at this 18 million ounces or more from these 3 mines for at least a decade. 2022 had the highest production in our history in 2023, '24, '25 and I think we're all going to set new production records for the company. And this growth doesn't require significant capital investment. Russell is going to talk about how we have the balance sheet and silver margins to achieve this and position us for even more growth.Russell?Russell Lawlar: Thanks, Phil. I'll start on Slide 6. The double-digit production growth we see -- we expect to see is being funded by our industry-leading silver margins, which have averaged more than 50% of the realized price of silver over the past few years. The direct result of these margins is the significant free cash flow generation we have seen over the past 3 years where our mines have generated more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow, including Casa Berardi's contribution of about $85 million from 2020 to 2022. In 2022, we made the decision to deploy this free cash flow in capital projects and larger equipment at the Lucky Friday mine, where we invested approximately $50 million. The acquisition of Alexco in which we've made equity investments in the loan earlier in the year of about $35 million and then an additional $20 million in development at the Keno Hill mine after the acquisition.We also invested $46 million in exploration and predevelopment programs in 2022. We did this while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet. On Slide 7, revenue for 2022 was $719 million, 39% from gold; 34% from silver; and 27% from base metals. Revenue in 2022 declined year-over-year due to lower silver prices and lower gold production with our Nevada operations on care and maintenance. Despite the lower realized prices, free cash flow generation from the 3 mines was approximately $110 million for the year, while our 2022 adjusted EBITDA declined $218 million due to the lower revenue and inflation-driven costs. Our net leverage ratio continued to be below our target of 2x. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet with $105 million in cash.We also monetized some long-term zinc hedges for approximately $17 million as zinc prices declined in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility in executing our plans. I'll now turn the call to Lauren.Metal, Mining, IndustryPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashLauren Roberts: Thanks, Russell. I will start on Slide 9. Greens Creek had another remarkable year. The mine produced 9.7 million ounces of silver seeing our guidance. Record throughput of 2,500 tons per day was achieved in the fourth quarter. In the time since we acquired full ownership of Greens Creek in 2008, and the mine's throughput has increased 20% from 2,000 tons per day to 2,415 tons per day. Equally impressive is that the recovery rate for each metal also increased during this period. Looking forward, we will continue our production ramp-up during the year and expect to achieve 2,600 tons per day in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter ASIC was higher compared to the third quarter due to higher treatment and freight costs because a silver concentrate shipment was deferred from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we conducted some seasonal maintenance activities to prepare for winter.The mine generated $120 million in free cash flow and nearly $1.9 billion in free cash flow since the mine started operations in 1989. Silver production guidance for 2023 is in line with 2022 at 9 million to 9.5 million ounces silver. Cash costs are expected to be lower at $0 to $0.25 per ounce, while the silver all-in sustaining cost is higher at $6 to $6.75 per ounce primarily due to equipment purchases and increased development as we target 2,600 tons per day. Moving to Slide 10. Lucky Friday reported a record year as the mine achieved operational milestones, including record tons processed and the highest silver production in the past 20 years. We also ratified a 6-year contract with the union, which reflects our strong working relationship and gives us the stability to continue to optimize the mine for further production growth.Silver production for the year was 4.4 million ounces. The UCB mining method is delivering impressive safety performance and production milestones at the mine. In 2022, we saw a 25% reduction in all incident frequency rate, an 11% increase in ore tons produced and a new all-time record for feet of development by company crews. Mill also is performing extremely well, delivering new all-time quarterly and annual throughput records as well as the largest ever year of zinc production. Just to put things in perspective, there has been a 68% increase in ore production since 2016, which was the last full year of production used in the previous mining method. Mine is expected to produce 4.5 million to 5 million ounces of silver in 2023 at all-in sustaining cost of $8.50 to $9.50 per ounce.Capital spend for the year will be in the range of $48 million to $51 million related to the remaining growth capital associated with the production expansion and infill drilling to support the UCB production method. 2022 marked many significant milestones to the transformation of this mine which began more than a decade ago with the sinking of the #4 shaft to access the high-grade ore we're mining today. of this success is coming from our peers as well. Lucky Friday is a recipient of the 2022 Society of Mining Engineers Murray Innovation Award for the pioneering UCB method. As I look ahead, I am more convinced than ever that the best decade of this 80-year-old mine is ahead of it, and I could not be more proud of the team leading this effort, and I am very grateful for the scores of others who have contributed to it over the years.Turning to Slide 11. Casa Berardi produced approximately 31,000 ounces of gold for the quarter and 128,000 ounces during the year. Mill continues to perform very well, achieving new throughput records. However, challenging underground mining conditions resulted in a high proportion of lower grade open pit ore to satisfy the mill. All-in sustaining cost for the year was $1,825 per gold ounce, exceeding our guidance due to lower metal production and higher production costs, driven by inflationary pressures. Casa Berardi is more exposed to inflation than our other mines because it moves and processes more material than all of our silver mines combined and there is no appreciable byproduct credit. However, even with these challenges in capital investment, the mine was near breakeven in cash flow.Our 2023 gold production guidance for the mine is reduced to 110,000 to 115,000 ounces of gold. This change reflects adjustments made to cutoff grades for inflation, fewer underground tons and more open pit tons as per the mine plan. All-in sustaining costs from the mine are expected to be $1,975 to $2,050 per ounce, higher than 2022, primarily due to lower gold production and higher sustaining capital associated with the expansion of the tailings facility. Casa Berardi remains an important asset in our portfolio that gives us scale, exposure to gold production, and exploration potential on a large and under-explored land package on the Casa Berardi break. At Keno Hill, we increased reserves by 33% to 49 million ounces of silver at 22 ounces per ton, among the highest in the world.Keno Hill would be the largest and highest grade primary gold -- primary silver mine in Canada. Development at the Birmingham and Flame &amp; Moth deposits are on track with the mill starting in the third quarter and full production of 440 tons per day achieved by year-end. Our guidance for 2023 production is 2.5 million to 3 million ounces of silver at an all-in sustaining cost of $12.25 to $14.75 per ounce. Capital spend for the year is estimated to be $42 million to $44 million as we continue development, receive more equipment and complete our mill and surface infrastructure projects. While we are laser focused on development and getting Keno Hill into full production, our confidence in the exploration potential of this district continues to grow.Moving to Slide 13. We have significant exploration success drilling 3 of our many underexplored targets. Some highlights from the program include 101 silver ounces per ton over 7 feet at Coral Wigwam, 10 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Hector-Calumet; and 19 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Silver King. These results demonstrate the strong exploration and discovery potential in the district. With this, I'll pass the call back to Phil.Phillips Baker: Thanks, Lauren. Just to comment on the exploration at Keno. When we announced the Alexco acquisition, Alexco asks if they should continue to explore, which they had a requirement to do so in either '22 or '23 because of funding. And so while, as Lauren said, our first priority was given the mine into full and consistent production, we allowed them to go ahead and continue that exploration program. And then, of course, we continued it once we closed the acquisition. We're really glad that they went forward with the program because this clearly shows that Keno has the potential to grow dramatically. Now if you'll turn to Slide 14 for our 3-year production guidance. We expect our silver production this year to increase 18% over '22 and continue to increase to as much as 20 million ounces in 2025, Keno with production between 2.5 million and 3 million ounces in Lucky Friday.That 4.5 million to 5 million drives the growth. Our consolidated silver all-in sustained cost is expected to come in approximately $10.25 to $11.50 after by-product credits. So that's consistent with where we were this past year. At today's prices, we see about $150 million of free cash flow that we're going to invest in exploration, pay dividends, maintain our land positions and invest in Casa. As Lauren noted, we've made some hard decisions to change our underground mine plant at Casa Berardi, where we've increased the cutoff grade, lower gold production, but by mining less marginal material and lowering our costs. So this year's gold production will be between 160,000 and 170,000 ounces about 110,000 to 115,000 ounces for Casa. And then we'll have a further decline to about 145,000 ounces next year for the company.With less production, all-in sustaining costs are expected to increase this year to around $2,000 per gold ounce. So we're going to make an investment net of about $20 million into Casa, so negative cash free cash flow at Casa. I realize that in the past 10 years, we've only had one other year that we've had negative free cash flow. So this is just a period of time we're more going to be investing in the tailings. We're going to be investing in surface mine infrastructure before we put the higher grade pits into production, which is going to lower the ASIC and the Casa free cash flow generating. We've changed the plan at Casa to improve the economics over 5 years, not as good economics currently, but better economics over a longer period of time.If you look at our total capital for the company, it's about $200 million, and it's split pretty evenly among the 4 operations. We also expect to invest more than $30 million in exploration predevelopment with the focus on Greens Creek for us to expand the reserves and resources. Casa Berardi on the underground targets to identify higher grade mineralization and at Keno Hill. And lastly, we're going to be focused on Keno's ramp-up, which we anticipate will cost approximately $9 million. So before we end our prepared remarks, I want to leave you all with a number, $1.1 trillion, and this is on Slide 15. The reason this number is significant is it's the amount that has been invested this past year in fossil fuels and also the same amount has been invested in renewables.And this is the first time ever this has happened. In the past, fossil fuel investment eclipsed renewables. No more. 2022 is really the tipping point. And since solar represents the fastest growing component of renewables, and it takes 0.5 million silver ounces for every gigawatt of solar panels that are installed, the appetite for silver is going to grow. So finally, I want to mention the remarkable safety performance we had in 2022. Our all-in frequency rate was 1.22 among the lowest in our history. And this operational and safety success is made possible only with the commitment and dedication of our employees. And with that, Regina, I'd like to open the call to questions.See also 12 Countries that Make the Best Whiskey and 12 Countries that Produce the Most Cars.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Interest in coal stocks waned so much that the VanEck Vectors coal ETF (KOL), the only coal ETF in the U.S., stopped trading after more than a decade of being active.Investment giants like Blackrock BLK have pushed for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and have promised to reduce investments in companies that produce emissions. Meanwhile, clean energy has taken a bigger slice of the pie, and energy solutions such as solar have become more efficient in recent years.Expect the UnexpectedWall Street is never obvious. Knowing what occurred over the past decade, one would think that very few if any coal stocks would be in business, let alone performing well. However, that is exactly what is happening. Over the past two years, coal stocks have remained in business and quietly became market leaders and some of the top performing stocks in the entire market. For example, since 2021, public coal producers such as Arch Resources Inc ARCH have gained 283%, while Alpha Metallurgical Resources AMR is up a mind-blowing 1,097%!Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat is Driving the Stellar Performance?Coal stocks not only have scorching hot performance but are also highly ranked. The coal industry ranks 19 out of the 251 industries tracked by Zacks, putting it in the top 8%. Arch Resources, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP, and Warrior Met Coal HCC hold a best possible Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while a handful of peers such as Peabody Energy BTU earn #2 (Buy) ranks. Coal stocks are benefitting from a variety of factors, including:Story continuesClean Energy is not Enough to Meet Supply Void:Despite the advent of the green energy revolution, the increase in alternative energy has not been enough to stave off increasing energy demand in recent years.Industry Consolidation: Because many weaker coal companies went out of business a few years ago, the remaining coal companies are benefiting from soaring demand.ESG:There’s a big difference between what many of the ESG proponents are saying versus doing. Contrary to the rhetoric around decreasing emissions, firms such as Blackrock, Bank of America BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, and J.P Morgan JPM, continue to invest billions of dollars in coal and other “dirty” energy.  FundamentalsThe soaring stock prices in the coal industry are not without merit. For example, Arch Resources grew EPS by 94% year-over-year in its latest quarter, while Alliance Resource Partners’ EPS vaulted more than 300%. SunCoke Energy SXC is yet another strong coal performer. Last quarter, earnings surprised by 133.33%, and the Consensus Estimate Trend has been positive over the past 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical Picture: Breakouts GaloreWhile the coal industry has seen a meteoric rise over the past two years, most names in the group have consolidated and digested in recent months. However, following recent blowout earnings, and firm EPS estimates moving forward, the coal leaders such as ARCH and HCC look poised to continue their uptrends. Both names are examples of just some of the coal stocks breaking out. On Thursday, ARCH rocketed higher by nearly 10% on volume more than double the norm. HCC is also breaking out from a multi-month base after a strong earnings report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayIndustry consolidation, strong demand, and a lack of ESG adherence is leading to strength in the coal industry. Recent earnings have been strong, expectations moving forward are robust, and multiple stocks are staging breakouts simultaneously – a confirmation signal for technicians. For these reasons, investors should remain bullish on coal leaders such as Warrior Met Coal and Arch Resources.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

From 2025 the government plans to release a new sustainable jobs plan every five years.""Canada has what it takes to become the clean energy and technology supplier of choice in a net-zero world,"" Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a news release.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been promising sustainable jobs legislation since 2019. But in Canada, the world's fourth-largest crude oil producer, the concept of retraining workers for clean energy jobs, also called a ""Just Transition"", became a lightening rod for criticism.In the crude-producing province Alberta, conservative Premier Danielle Smith has accused Trudeau of wanting to phase out the oil and gas sector.The Alberta government is ""perplexed"" by the jobs plan not mentioning a liquefied natural gas export strategy and has ""grave concerns"" about it not recognising the provinces' right to manage their own natural resources, Smith said in a statement on Friday.""This kind of dysfunctional communication by the federal government with our province cannot continue if Canada is to have any chance of achieving its 2050 emissions reduction targets,"" she said.The federal government said enormous clean energy opportunities are emerging in oil-producing provinces, from hydrogen to critical minerals. There will also be sustainable jobs in conventional energy industries as Canadian producers aim to lower the carbon intensity of their crude, according to the document.Story continues""Rather than a shortage of jobs, in Canada we are much more likely to see an abundance of sustainable jobs with a shortage of workers required to fill them,"" the plan said.Think-tanks Clean Energy Canada expects jobs in the sector will grow by 3.4% annually over the next decade, nearly four times faster than the Canadian average.On Thursday, Smith wrote to Trudeau offering to collaborate with the federal government on developing carbon capture and storage incentives, but only if Ottawa secured Alberta's consent on climate policies that affect oil and gas, including clean energy jobs legislation.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Fast Is QUALCOMM Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. To the delight of shareholders, QUALCOMM has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of QUALCOMM shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 31% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of QUALCOMM's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre QUALCOMM Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since QUALCOMM has a market capitalisation of US$142b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$180m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of QUALCOMM but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does QUALCOMM Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?QUALCOMM's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, QUALCOMM is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - QUALCOMM has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL.Upgraded Broker Ratings Make These 3 Stocks Worth Buying in 2023The year 2023 started on a positive note as the Federal Reserve's ultra-aggressive monetary tightening resulted in the cooling down of inflation. But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high til inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like The Kroger Co., Expedia Group, Inc. and Ralph Lauren Corp. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They precisely assess companies' publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are three stocks that qualified for the screening:Cincinnati, OH-based Kroger operates supermarkets under banners including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, Harris Teeter, Jay C, King Soopers, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's.

It has three business segments: Expedia Product and Technology, Expedia Brands and Expedia for Business.It's brands includes Expedia, Hotels.com, Expedia Partner Solutions, Vrbo, trivago, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotfi, ebookers, CheapTickets, Expedia Group Media Solutions, CarRentals.com, and Expedia Cruises.A Surprising Miss in the Fourth Quarter of 2022On Feb 9, 2023, Expedia reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. It posted a big miss on the fourth quarter, reporting $1.26 versus the consensus of $1.85. That's a 31% miss.With travel demand so strong, what went wrong?Expedia said the quarter was negatively impacted by severe weather but that demand was ""markedly stronger"" since the start of the year.2022 was a strong rebound year coming out of the pandemic downturn. Booked room nights were up 26% and revenue gained 36% last year.""We begin '23 with record app usage and member counts, led by Expedia US, the first of our brands to deploy new capabilities and marketing strategies. This year, we are excited to see these benefits accrue to more of our brands and geographies, driving further growth and marginexpansion,"" said Peter Kern, CEO.Earnings Estimates for 2023 and 2024 on the RiseThe analysts are still bullish on travel, and Expedia, for the next two years. Demand is still strong.Story continues3 estimates are up for 2023 in the last 30 days, although 1 estimate has also been cut, pushing up the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $9.23 from $8.97 during that time.This is earnings growth of 35.9% over 2022 as Expedia only earned $6.79 last year.Analysts expect further growth in 2024 as well. The 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate is up in the last 30 days to $11.64 from $10.79. That's another 26% earnings growth.Shares Are CheapExpedia shares sold off in 2022 along with the other growth stocks. It declined 47% in the last year.But, along with the earnings rising, that means the stock is cheap on a classic valuation basis. It has a forward P/E of just 12.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.Expedia also has a PEG ratio of 0.9. A PEG ratio under 1.0 means a company has both growth and value. It's also a sign the stock is cheap.Expedia is shareholder friendly and has an ongoing share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it repurchased about 3.7 million shares for $347 million. It has about 18 million shares remaining under the authorization.For investors looking for a value stock in the fast growing travel industry, Expedia is one to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:Digital Turbine, Inc. is still seeing macro headwinds. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see declining earnings in Fiscal 2023 but is hopeful for a rebound later this calendar year.Digital Turbine, headquartered in Austin, Texas, is a mobile growth platform for advertisers, publishers, carriers and OEMS. By integrating a full ad stack with proprietary technology built into devices by wireless operators and OEMs, it supercharges advertising and monetization.It has offices in large cities across the United States, and in London, Berlin, Singapore, and Tel Aviv.A Big Miss in Fiscal Third QuarterOn Feb 8, 2023, Digital Turbine reported its fiscal third quarter of 2023 and missed on the Zacks Consensus. It reported earnings of $0.29 versus the consensus of $0.37.It was the company's second miss in the last 4 quarters.Revenue fell 25% to $162.3 million compared to the year ago period.""While nothing has changed regarding our long-term view of the digital media industry or our strategic positioning within the industry, macro headwinds are impacting our near-term results,"" said Bill Stone, CEO.""We expect current macro headwinds to continue into the first half of the calendar year, but our high-level strategic vision remains intact, as advertising spending tends to be among the first items to be negatively impacted at the onset of a cyclical downturn, but is typically also among the first items to rebound,"" he added.Analysts Cut Fiscal 2023 and 2024 Earnings EstimatesThe analysts are bearish given the challenging macro environment.2 estimates have been cut for Fiscal 2023 since the earnings report, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $1.18 from $1.32. This is an earnings decline of 28.9% as the company made $1.66 in fiscal 2022.Analysts also cut for Fiscal 2024 cutting the Zacks Consensus down to $1.17 from $1.40. That's just a penny less than this year but shows that the analysts, for now, think that earnings might stabilize in the second half of this calendar year.Shares Sink 85% in the Last 2 YearsIt's been rough being a shareholder of Digital Turbine the last 2 years. Shares are down 85% during that time.Even in 2023, shares are down 15.8% year-to-date after the earnings miss sent shares tumbling again.But, the good news is that they are now cheap. Digital Turbine trades with a forward P/E of 11.3. It also has a PEG ratio of just 0.8. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company is undervalued.However, investors interested in the online advertising industry might want to wait until the macro headwinds abate before jumping in.Additional content:3 Stocks to Buy on Solid Rebound in Retail SalesThe retail sector has had a hard time as soaring prices compelled people to spend cautiously. However, sales bounced back in January as inflation showed signs of easing. Demand is still high, which is helping boost retail sales. Moreover, the labor market is still going strong despite the growing inflationary pressure.This is helping people as purchasing power has continued to increase with new job additions to the economy. Given this situation, stocks like Tapestry, Inc., Conagra Brands, Inc. and Arhaus, Inc. are likely to benefit from a surge in retail sales.Retail Sales ReboundRetail sales in the United States rose a solid 3% month over month in January, beating economists' expectations of a rise of 1.9%, the Commerce Department said on Feb 15. January's jump follows a 1.1% decline in December. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 2.3%, which was also higher than the expectations of a jump of 0.9%.The impressive numbers reported in January were driven by sales in food services and drinking places, which surged 7.2% month over month. Sales at motor dealers and parts dealers increased 5.9%, while sales at furniture and furnishings stores climbed 4.4%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 3.5%.However, receipts at gas stations remained flat despite gas prices increasing 2.4%.E-commerce, which has been playing a key role in driving retail sales since the onset of the pandemic, once again helped the sector, as online sales rose 1.3%. E-commerce has turned out to be the most preferred mode of shopping.The pandemic saw millions shopping from home in order to maintain social distancing on fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus. This made them finally realize the safety and convenience of shopping online. The trend has continued since then and has been helping the retail sector in a major way.Moreover, people have been spending more freely over the past couple of months as inflation has been showing signs of easing. Although the consumer price index (CPI), the preferred gauge of measuring inflation, increased 0.5% in January, inflation has slowed in the prior months.Another reason that has been helping the retail sector is the solid job additions to the economy. The job market is still doing well despite rising inflationary pressures that have forced individuals to spend cautiously.The labor market remained resilient in 2022 and this year too, it has been good so far.The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased a solid 517,000, which came in above economists' expectations of a modest 187,000 increase. This follows job gains of 260,000 in December.This came as the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, its lowest level since 1969. With jobs being added at an aggressive pace, people will get more money in hand, which will help them spend more.Our ChoicesThis is thus the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have both a strong offline and online presence.Tapestry, Inc. is a designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally.

CPS is a hypersonic boost-glide weapon system that enables long range missile flight at speeds greater than Mach 5, with high survivability against enemy defenses.""Lockheed Martin continues to advance hypersonic strike capability for the United States through this new contract,"" said Steve Layne, vice president of Hypersonic Strike Weapon Systems at Lockheed Martin. ""Early design work is already underway.

The company, along with industry partners including subcontractors Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics Mission Systems, is on track to provide the CPS surface-launched, sea-based hypersonic strike capability to sailors by the mid-2020s. The contract also provides for additional AURs plus canisters for the U.S. Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW)  testing, training and tactical employment.A Shared MissileCPS shares a common AUR with the Army LRHW and can be launched from multiple platforms including surface ships, submarines, and land-based mobile launchers.Lockheed Martin is the prime systems integrator for the CPS and LRHW weapon systems.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +11.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.28 points to a change of -32.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.35 indicates a change of +0.9% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $14.16 billion and $14.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -12.7% and +2.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

117,34b669f1-e75e-384a-b30e-dc590723a758,JNJ,2023-02-18,Cancer patient asks court to end Georgia-Pacific asbestos bankruptcy,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cancer-patient-asks-court-end-002524814.html,1676679924,STORY,['JNJ'],"[*Patient says unit Bestwall not in financial distress*Bestwall was example of 'Texas two-step' bankruptcy strategy*J&amp;J emulated strategy for talc claims, stumbled on appealBy Dietrich KnauthFeb 17 (Reuters) - A cancer patient on Friday asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to dismiss the long-running bankruptcy of a Georgia-Pacific subsidiary, arguing that it serves no purpose other than to prevent asbestos-related lawsuits from proceeding in other courts.The bankruptcy case began in 2017, when Georgia-Pacific, a unit of industrial conglomerate Koch Industries, spun off its liabilities for asbestos litigation into a new company, Bestwall, which then filed for bankruptcy. Wilson Buckingham, who was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2020 and who sued Georgia-Pacific, was one of thousands of plaintiffs whose lawsuits was blocked by the move.Buckingham's attorneys argued Friday that the Bestwall bankruptcy should face the same fate as the bankruptcy of a Johnson &amp; Johnson-created subsidiary, which an appeals court dismissed last month.In his court filing, the first to challenge Georgia-Pacific in the wake of the J&amp;J unit's bankruptcy dismissal, Buckingham alleged that Bestwall's bankruptcy used a ""nearly identical"" strategy, known as the ""Texas two-step.""J&amp;J had created the subsidiary, LTL Management, to absorb liabilities for lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc products caused cancer. LTL immediately filed for Chapter 11.The U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found that neither J&amp;J nor LTL were in ""financial distress"" at the time of the LTL bankruptcy filing.J&amp;J has challenged the Third Circuit ruling. It maintains that its baby powder and other talc products are safe.Representatives for Koch and Georgia-Pacific did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Asbestos claimants previously tried to dismiss the Bestwall bankruptcy, but U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laura Beyer denied that request in July 2019. The official committee appointed to represent asbestos claimants has appealed that decision.Story continuesIn his court filing, Buckingham argued that the Third Circuit's ruling on ""financial distress"" was particularly relevant to Bestwall, because Georgia-Pacific was able to pay nearly $2.5 billion in dividends to its parent company Koch Industries last year, according to Buckingham's motion.The Third Circuit ruling does not apply to courts in North Carolina, where the Bestwall case is proceeding. But Buckingham argued that the recent ruling, combined with the lack of progress in the Bestwall case, require the bankruptcy court to consider dismissal with ""fresh eyes.""The Bestwall case began with promises to ""fairly compensate"" asbestos claimants, but five years of stagnation in bankruptcy court have shown that those assurances by Bestwall, Georgia-Pacific, and Koch Industries have ""proven untrue,"" Buckingham's attorneys wrote. With a bankruptcy settlement out of reach, cancer victims should be allowed to resume their lawsuits, according to Buckingham's motion.Several major companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and 3M Co, have turned to the bankruptcy courts in an attempt to manage their mass tort liabilities, a practice Reuters detailed last year. Plaintiff attorneys have called the cases an improper manipulation of the bankruptcy system, while the companies say the Chapter 11 filings are aimed at compensating claimants fairly and equitably.Military service members who have sued 3M over allegedly defective earplugs have already seized on the LTL ruling to push for the dismissal of a bankruptcy case blocking their claims against 3M and its subsidiary Aearo.The case is In re: Bestwall LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, No. 17-31795For Bestwall: Gregory Gordon and Daniel Prieto of Jones Day.For Buckingham: Jon Ruckdeschel of Ruckdeschel Law Firm (Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)]"

Our Model estimates 5.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2023, with 13.2% growth on a currency neutral basis.NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. The Zacks analyst expect soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Also, the new U.S. export regulations, supply-chain disruptions and mounting expenses remain overhangs.(You can read the full research report on KLA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Airbnb, Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.73 on the 10th of April, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 2.7% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Merck Merck's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Based on the last payment, Merck was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 54.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMerck Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.68 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.7% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Merck has impressed us by growing EPS at 46% per year over the past five years. Merck is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.Merck Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The Technology in Space Prize is an annual award opportunity from the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, Inc. (CASIS) and Boeing [NYSE: BA] for qualified startup companies interested in leveraging the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory for research and technology development (R&amp;D). Machine Bio seeks to validate proprietary technology for the synthesis of protein from a DNA template in a single step onboard the space station. The project was announced last night at the MassChallenge awards dinner in Boston.The ISS and future space-based laboratories provide a valuable platform for drug discovery and development research and use-inspired science. However, methods for the production of pure proteins needed for drug discovery research require the cultivation of large volumes of cells and time-consuming purification steps that are slow and labor intensive. These methods are inefficient on Earth and infeasible for a space-based laboratory, so currently, proteins are produced on Earth and then launched to space. This makes it difficult to do iterative research, which is crucial to the drug development process.Machine Bio has designed a cell-free technology that promises to cut the cost and production time for the synthesis of pure proteins. The company's technology produces protein faster than traditional methods, using less labor and less space. Machine Bio seeks to utilize the ISS National Lab to validate the technology's function in microgravity. In doing so, this may allow the company to advance its technology readiness level, bringing it closer to commercialization. The ability to quickly manufacture pure protein in space would be a significant advancement for biomedical research in low Earth orbit and will be crucial for studies on future spaceflight missions farther from Earth. Story continuesIn-space production applications is a strategic focus area for the ISS National Lab. Applied research and development in this area demonstrates space-based manufacturing and production to enable new business growth and capital investment and to create scalable and sustainable market opportunities.This marks the eighth time CASIS and Boeing have partnered to fund research for startups through the Technology in Space Prize in collaboration with the MassChallenge startup accelerator. Since its inception, the Technology in Space Prize has provided $9.7 million in funding to 30 startups for R&amp;D sponsored by the ISS National Lab. Many of these investigations have already launched to station.For example, biotechnology startup MicroQuin, a 2018 awardee of the Technology in Space Prize, launched an investigation to better understand the onset and progression of cancer. The project used 3D cell culture to examine cell signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis (the process by which normal cells transform into cancer cells). MicroQuin also tested how cancer cells responded to a new cancer therapeutic the company has developed.Other examples include LambdaVision, which took advantage of microgravity conditions to improve the manufacturing process for the company's artificial retina, and RevBio (formerly LaunchPad Medical), which utilized the ISS to test an injectable bone adhesive to accelerate bone repair. Many startups awarded the Technology in Space Prize have gone on to obtain additional funding from outside sources to advance their research. In fact, subsequent to being awarded the Technology in Space Prize, the awardees as a group have raised more than 30 times the funding provided through the prize.Grants awarded through the Technology in Space Prize provide seed funding and assist with hardware costs for a flight project using ISS National Lab flight and crew time allocation. To learn more about applying for the Technology in Space Prize, view entry information on the MassChallenge webpage.The ISS National Lab is managed by CASIS through a Cooperative Agreement with NASA. Final award of any grant money is contingent upon acceptance of legal terms and conditions between Machine Bio, CASIS, and Boeing.To learn more about the ISS National Lab, including current research announcements to propose projects that leverage the orbiting platform, please visit www.ISSNationalLab.org.To download a high-resolution photo for this release, click here.About the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory:The International Space Station (ISS) is a one-of-a-kind laboratory that enables research and technology development not possible on Earth. As a public service enterprise, the ISS National Lab allows researchers to leverage this multiuser facility to improve life on Earth, mature space-based business models, advance science literacy in the future workforce, and expand a sustainable and scalable market in low Earth orbit.

The Zacks analyst expect soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind.

133,ba7f7f50-47c5-3929-8254-a7b9b6eaae70,NKE,2023-02-18,Dick’s Sporting Goods' relationship with Nike ‘one advantage’ for the retailer: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dick-sporting-goods-relationship-nike-152103499.html,1676647263,VIDEO,"['NKE', 'DKS']","[Loop Capital Markets Managing Director Anthony Chukumba joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss initiating a Hold rating on Dick’s Sporting Goods, inventory risks to profits and cashflow, competition in the sporting goods retail space, the outlook for Dick’s Sporting Goods, plus the outlook for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond following its capital raise.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JULIE HYMAN: Loop Capital is feeling cautious optimism towards Dick's Sporting Goods, initiating the retailer with a hold rating and a $130 price target and touting its consistent positive free cash flow, but still awaits a more attractive entry point. The man behind that call, friend of the show, Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets Managing Director.Anthony, it's great to see you. I got to tell you, Brian Sozzi and I have been talking about Dick's Sporting Goods because we each have had experiences as of late where we go into a Dick's, great space, lots of cool merchandise, and, like, crickets in terms of trying to get help on the floor of the store. So I'm going to start there instead of specifically on your call in terms of what you think about the staffing and customer service at Dick's right now.ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: I'm a little surprised by that because one of the things we really like about Dick's is that they do have superior customer service. I mean, part of that is the elevated footwear department, part of that is the fact they own Golf Galaxy, the largest golf retailer in the US. And so-- so they definitely have some pretty good customer service in that department as well as with Golf Galaxy, a lot of the stores have golf simulators and putting greens. So I'm a little surprised. That might be a little bit of a one-off experience. Maybe they just don't like you and Brian, I don't know.[LAUGHTER]JULIE HYMAN: Could be. Could be.BRAD SMITH: End of sentence.JULIE HYMAN: I don't know. I was with my kid. We were trying to get some help on them-- in the baseball section. But maybe, I don't know.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Anthony, well, it's clear--JULIE HYMAN: But they might not like Sozz. That's a good point.BRIAN SOZZI: Anthony, it's clear. All Dick's has to do is put a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in the store, and all their problems will be solved. But, no. But, no, look, we'll get to that in a second. But my real question here is, what is the inventory situation at Dick's Sporting Goods? How big are-- how much inventory are they sitting on? Is it a big risk to profits and cash flow over the next couple of quarters?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: They don't really seem to have any inventory issues, at least that I'm aware of at this time. I mean, they weren't one of the retailers who had way too much inventory early last year and had to work through it. So I think their inventory position is perfectly fine.I mean, if anything, look, one advantage that Dick's has a lot of-- relative to a lot of other sporting goods retailers is that they have this very, very close relationship with Nike. And they're getting a lot of exclusive Nike product that you can really only get from Nike.com. So I don't think that inventory is a real issue for Dick's right now.BRAD SMITH: You know what, you mentioned Golf Galaxy. I'm going to bite on that because Tiger Woods is back. He's playing this weekend, and everybody's excited. So I need to ask for Golf Galaxy within Dick's, what type of growth do you need to see within that brand specifically? And does it have its own standalone power if Dick's was decide to-- would decide to, say, spin it off one day?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: Well, remember, that would be counter to the fact that they bought Golf Galaxy, right? I mean, look, Golf Galaxy has been great for Dick's, less as a standalone concept and more bring that product into Dick's stores and making Dick's sort of the go-to store for golf equipment. So, yeah, I mean, Dick's has about 730 of their core Dick's stores.They've got 130 or so different specialty stores, and Golf Galaxy is one of them. But I think, to a large extent, one of the things that they've been really good at doing is testing different initiatives in these specialty stores and the ones that work integrating those into the core Dick's store. And I think it's really kind of an 80/20 rule where they're getting the vast majority of their sales and the profits from the core Dick's stores.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, Anthony, what do you think is going to unlock the next phase then? If you think that your scenario is priced in here, I guess one of two things have to happen. Either the stock's going to have to go down for some reason and then it would become more attractive, or something else is going to come to help it higher, help drive a little more growth. Which is-- which do you think is going to happen?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: So, quite frankly, I mean, look, part of the reason that I'm at a hold rating is that I have a hard time seeing what that next catalyst would be, right? And if I don't really have visibility in terms of that next catalyst, then, yeah, I sort of have to wait for the former, right? I have to wait for that pullback in the stock price. I mean, look, the stock's not terribly expensive relative to a lot of other stocks that I cover, but it is trading at about 11 times my 2023 EPS estimate. And the average over the last few years has been more like 9 and 1/2 times.The other thing-- and look, this is-- it's a little bit unfair to Dick's, but it is what it is. I can't help but compare them to Academy Sports. Academy Sports trades at a three turn multiple discount to Dick's. And I think Academy Sports just has better square footage growth prospects. I mean, one of the concerns I have with Dick's is that core Dick's concept is pretty much saturated in the US. They've got about, like I said, 700 or so stores. Academy's got less than 300.BRIAN SOZZI: Anthony, one company that has no earnings, of course, is Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. We have a rolling blog with this on you. How in the world did they get close to a billion dollars of money? And does that keep them in business?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: Yeah, those are great questions, Brian. So first off let's not get it twisted. They didn't get a billion dollars, right? They got, what, $200 or so. They have an option to get another $700, $800. They have to jump through a bunch of different hoops to do that.Look, when I first saw this news, I was really scratching my head, particularly given the fact that I know the lead investor pretty well, and they're very, very smart money. But then once I started to peel the onion, I'm like, oh, OK. Yeah, this makes sense. I mean, essentially, without going into all the specifics because I don't want to bore your audience, the way that this works is that they issued this preferred stock, but the preferred stock is convertible to common stock pretty much at any time at a discount to the stock price, regardless of where the stock price is.So in other words, at any-- if the stock's at $2, then it's a discount to that. If the stock's at $1, it's at a discount to that, all the way down to about $0.70. And as far as I can tell, there's really no restrictions in terms of selling the stock.So in other words, at any time, you can convert your preferred into common stock. You get that common stock at a discount to the current stock price. And then you can sell that stock at any time. It's like a license to print money. I mean, it's like-- it's literally heads, I win, tails, you lose.BRIAN SOZZI: I'll just say, Anthony, how does that-- is that good for Bed Bath longer term? I mean, do they make it to next year?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: So look, desperate times call for desperate measures, right? I mean, they were on the verge of going bankrupt. And now they've got this $200 or so million, and maybe there's more behind it. But given how fast they're burning through cash, you know, I think this just-- all it did was forestall the inevitable.BRAD SMITH: Anthony, I just want to come back to something you mentioned here because it actually got the wheels turning a little bit on Golf Galaxy and really just giving away my golf fandom at this point. But when you think about the fact that they do have all of these add-on locations-- and as you were mentioning, it sounds like much of the sales in that category are still going through Dick's proper right now-- does that mean that they would actually benefit then from perhaps closing down some of those Golf Galaxy capacities and then bringing that inventory more into where customers are already going for some of the other categories as well?ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: That's certainly a possibility. I mean, my guess is that, in a lot of cases, the Golf Galaxy, the standalone stores, are in areas where they don't have a Dick's, and maybe it's too small of a markets to support a Dick's. But-- but certainly that is something that they could do, you know, if it made sense for them.BRIAN SOZZI: Loop Capital Markets Managing Director Anthony Chukumba. Always good to see you, my friend. We'll talk to you soon.ANTHONY CHUKUMBA: Sounds good.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.79 per share, unchanged in the past 30 days. The figure indicates a decline of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Non-GAAP revenues are anticipated to be between $621.8 million and $656.8 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $646.5 million, suggesting a decline of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseANSYS, Inc. price-eps-surprise | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteThe company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.8%, on average. In the past year, shares of ANSS have lost 12% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 6.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to NoteHigher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals like aerospace &amp; defense, high tech and automotive is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bode well. Increasing demand within the healthcare segment is another tailwind.Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided fourth-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.Increased demand for advanced driver-assistance-systems technology, due to rising safety norms and sensor development solutions, is likely to drive demand for the company’s simulation solutions.Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure. Higher costs on product enhancements, acquisitions, and research and development are likely to have exerted pressure on margin expansion in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsIn January 2023, ANSYS announced the acquisition of Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software’s (ESSS) subsidiary - Rocky DEM. This acquisition will allow ANSYS to offer its customers a broader range of engineering simulation software solutions by integrating Rocky's DEM tools and expertise.The current acquisition is a continuation of ANSYS’ and ESSS’ collaboration in 2021 to develop DEM workflow to effectively analyze particle movement across several industrial applications.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for ANSYS this time around.

137,da9bda4e-1f4f-3633-b2f8-99a2c5731faa,WFC,2023-02-18,Clean Heating at Cool Costs,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-heating-cool-costs-141500485.html,1676643300,STORY,"['WFC', 'WFC-PD']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2023 / Wells Fargo:When Katherine Parks' furnace started to fail, she knew replacing the unit was nonnegotiable. She needed heating to endure Chicago's frosty winters - and to continue operating her home day care center.Estimates she received were cost prohibitive. Fortunately, she knew about the climate justice organization Elevate, which installed energy-efficient electric heat pumps and upgraded Parks' sealing and insulation to prevent heat loss from her home.Parks, who'd been covering her windows with plastic sheeting to keep in heat, felt a variety of emotions: overjoyed, grateful, blessed. ""I don't have to worry about if my furnace is going to explode. It removed a lot of stress and worry for me on a day-to-day basis.""""Because of the partnership and the generosity of the Wells Fargo Foundation, we were able to do a complete upgrade for Katherine's home, making it energy efficient and comfortable,"" said Anne Evens, Elevate CEO.Evens estimates that Parks' utility bills will decrease by about $800 a year - a significant amount that, she said, ""means you go from just barely scraping by to having a little bit of a cushion.""Eliminating the struggle of deciding which bills to payEarlier this year, Wells Fargo donated $3.15 million to Elevate for a two-year project to decarbonize 100 Chicago homes for low- and moderate-income families and to build the capacity and expertise of 24 contractors of color to participate in the green economy.""One of the most significant remaining contributions to greenhouse gas emissions is related to the energy we consume to heat or cool or power our homes,"" Evens said. ""What we aim to do is make sure these clean energy upgrades are happening in affordable housing first and not last.""Elevate's vision matches well with Wells Fargo's commitment to supporting sustainability.""Wells Fargo's climate commitment includes climate-aligned philanthropy to ensure that the most vulnerable communities are not left behind,"" said Robyn Luhning, chief sustainability officer.Story continues""Programs such as Elevate's help low-income families and historically underrepresented communities access the benefits of a reliable, equitable, and sustainable economy,"" Luhning said. ""This is especially important because heating and cooling cost savings can significantly impact monthly budgets.""Evens explained that people living in affordable housing tend to struggle with energy bills - often having to prioritize which bills to pay. This effort will reduce or eliminate that struggle.""Facing disconnection notices and living through this huge stress of wanting to keep your electricity on and your gas on, it's absolutely not necessary because we have the technologies to reduce their energy consumption by over 50%,"" Evens said.Retraining a workforce in clean technologiesIn addition to providing economic solutions for homeowners, Elevate is also training women, veterans, and people of color to install emerging technologies.Energy efficiency installations and the transition to clean technologies also create job opportunities. Elevate's Contractor Accelerator Program ""provides opportunities in job training and contractor engagement for people who have had limited access to this fast-growing sector,"" said Luhning.The Contractor Accelerator Program has trained and certified 200 contractors. Elevate also teaches them how to bid on projects and develop a business growth plan.Luhning, who attended a roundtable discussion with Elevate contractors, was moved by what she heard.""It was incredibly compelling to hear from this community of contractors. One person said: ‘We get left behind in every economic opportunity. For once, we're not going to be left behind.'""Enduring extreme heat with adequate coolingAs critical as heating is in cold climates, cooling is also becoming a must-have, according to Evens.It's rare for people to have cooling in places where high temperatures are atypical, she said. ""With climate change bringing extreme heat, folks who don't have cooling can't be expected to survive multiple days of 110+ degree weather. I view that as an injustice.""Fortunately, the heat pumps Elevate is installing serve a dual purpose, providing both heating and cooling. Evens said there's a lot of excitement from residents about having cooling for the first time - especially in households with children, seniors, and people with respiratory health issues. Parks is likewise enthusiastic, as the kids in her day care will enjoy respite from the heat in the summer.""In addition to having reliable heating equipment and less stress in her life,"" said Evens, ""Katherine also now has cooling, which is increasingly important as we all face increasing extreme heat.""Wells Fargo hopes to learn from its partnership with Elevate and replicate it in other communities, Luhning said.""We're boosting access to clean, affordable energy. We're boosting access to jobs. And we're lowering carbon emissions - all at the same time. It's a win-win-win,"" Luhning said.

Roche RHHBY announced new phase III data, which showed that the eye drug Vabysmo improved vision in people with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Novo Nordisk’s NVO partner Heartseed dosed the first patient in a phase I/II study on an investigational cell therapy for heart failure.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approves Pfizer’s Cibinqo to Treat Eczema in Adolescents: The FDA granted approval to Pfizer’s oral, once-daily, JAK1 inhibitor, Cibinqo (abrocitinib), to treat refractory moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema in adolescents. Cibinqo was approved for treating eczema in adults 18 years and older in January 2022. The FDA approval for Cibinqo for adolescents was based on data from the phase III study, JADE TEEN.Pfizer also announced that the FDA has granted priority review for its supplemental new drug application (sNDA) seeking approval for a combination of its cancer drugs, Talzenna plus Xtandi for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The FDA is expected to give its decision on the sNDA later this year.Roche’s Vabysmo Meets Goal in Phase III Studies for New Indication: Roche’s eye drug, Vabysmo, met its primary endpoint in two phase III studies evaluating it for vision loss associated with retinal vein occlusion. The phase III studies, BALATON and COMINO, evaluated Vabysmo (faricimab) in macular edema due to branch and central retinal vein occlusion (BRVO and CRVO). In the studies, treatment with Vabysmo led to an early and sustained improvement in vision, meeting the primary endpoint of non-inferior visual acuity gains compared to another eye medicine, aflibercept. The data from the studies also showed that patients treated with Vabysmo experienced an absence of blood vessel leakage in the retina compared to aflibercept in a pre-specified exploratory endpoint. Vabysmo is already approved to treat neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. If approved, RVO would be the third indication for Vabysmo.Story continuesNovo Nordisk’s Partner Begins Phase I Study on Heart Failure Candidate:  Novo Nordisk’s partner, Heartseed announced that it has successfully dosed the first patient in a phase I/II study on pipeline candidate, HS-001 – an investigational cell therapy for heart failure.

The case primarily centers on false theories pushed on Fox programs by associates of former President Donald Trump, including Sidney Powell and Rudolph Giuliani, that Dominion’s systems contributed to throwing the election for Mr. Biden.Continue reading]"

(AP) — To millions of viewers, Fox News hosts gave allies of former President Donald Trump a platform to champion false claims that he lost the 2020 election because of voter fraud. To one another, they expressed doubts about the claims and mocked the people making them.Private exchanges between Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, and other network bigwigs — including the chairman of Fox Corporation, Rupert Murdoch — show a wide chasm between what the network promoted in primetime and the doubts that its stars held behind the camera, according to new court filings in a defamation lawsuit being waged by a company whose voting systems were regularly maligned on air.“Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence for election fraud, Carlson said via text on Nov. 16, 2020 to a Fox News producer, referring to one of Trump’s lawyers.Ingraham texted Carlson that Powell is “a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy,” referring to the former New York mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani.These and other internal communications were included in a redacted brief filed Thursday by attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems, which is suing Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, for $1.6 billion.In a deposition, host Sean Hannity said “that whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, I did not believe it for one second,” according to Dominion’s filing.Murdoch, meanwhile, in a Nov. 19 email, described what he saw in a press conference that day featuring Giuliani and Powell as “Really crazy stuff. And damaging.”Dominion's legal case rests on its belief that Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims that the company had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements.Attorneys for Fox argued in a counterclaim unsealed Thursday that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. They said Dominion has advanced “novel defamation theories” and is seeking a “staggering” damage figure aimed at generating headlines, chilling protected speech and enriching Dominion’s private equity owner, Staple Street Capital Partners.Story continues“Dominion brought this lawsuit to punish FNN for reporting on one of the biggest stories of the day — allegations by the sitting President of the United States and his surrogates that the 2020 election was affected by fraud,” the counterclaim states. “The very fact of those allegations was newsworthy.”Fox attorneys have noted that Carlson repeatedly questioned Powell’s claims in his broadcasts. “When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,” Carlson told viewers on Nov. 19, 2020.Fox attorneys say Dominion’s own public relations firm expressed skepticism in December 2020 as to whether the network’s coverage was defamatory. They also point to an email from Oct. 30, 2020, just days before the election, in which Dominion’s director of product strategy and security complained that the company’s products were “just riddled with bugs.”In their counterclaim, Fox attorneys wrote that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.“Freedom of speech and freedom of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,"" Fox attorneys wrote.Fox attorneys warn that threatening the company with a $1.6 billion judgment will cause other media outlets to think twice about what they report.Responses by both sides to the briefs made public on Thursday remain under seal. Fox has said Dominion's filing includes “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context,” and that it has refused to allow Fox to make its response to Dominion's brief public. Attorneys for Fox and Dominion told The Associated Press on Friday that responses to the briefs will remain under seal until Feb. 27.Dominion on Friday filed its own challenge to the redactions in the briefs, including its own. “Dominion’s position is that nothing in these three briefs warrants confidential treatment,” attorneys for the company wrote, adding that all redactions were done at Fox's request.If either side can persuade Superior Court Judge Eric Davis to grant summary judgment in its favor, the case will end without a jury trial. If not, the trial is scheduled to begin in mid-April.In its 192-page brief, Dominion said the judge should rule in its favor because “no reasonable juror could find in Fox’s favor on each element of Dominion’s defamation claim.” Dominion attorneys also assert that no reasonable juror could find in favor of Fox’s “neutral reportage” and “fair report” defenses.“Recounts and audits conducted by election officials across the U.S. repeatedly confirmed the election’s outcome, including specifically that Dominion’s machines accurately counted votes,” Dominion’s filing states.Fox News attorneys argue the network’s coverage and commentary are not defamatory and that there is no evidence the hosts had any malicious intent behind what they said about Dominion — an important legal standard in First Amendment cases.Davis ruled last month that, for the purposes of the defamation claims, he will consider Dominion to be a public figure. That means Dominion must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Fox defendants acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.]"

In particular, the ability of AI and machine learning protocols to meet users where they are – that is, to speak their (human) language – sparked intense curiosity. Essentially, we may be standing on a paradigm shift.Just by the numbers alone, the artificial intelligence trend compels onlookers to pay close attention. According to Grand View Research, the global AI market stood at a valuation of $136.55 billion last year. Between 2023 and 2030, the segment may expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3%, culminating in a sector revenue of $1.81 trillion. To their credit, several companies are taking the initiative, attempting to stay atop of the artificial intelligence trend. Below are seven compelling stocks to consider.NFLXNetflix$359.96IBMIBM.$136.01MSFTMicrosoft$272.17DEDeere$409.31SSentinelOne$16.65GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$94.95LMNDLemonade$16.80InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNetflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockOn the surface level, content streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks among the top entertainment players, not one banking on the broader artificial intelligence trend. However, to stay ahead of the curve, Netflix deploys AI tools to enhance the consumer experience. Specifically, it uses deep learning protocols to understand subscribers’ likes and dislikes. From there, Netflix recommends appropriate content.To be fair, NFLX stock represents a risky proposition among enterprises focused on the artificial intelligence trend. For much of 2022, it suffered steep losses before trudging much higher over the past few months. Still, despite a strong performance so far this year, in the trailing 365 days, NFLX gave up 12.4% of equity value.Nevertheless, from an operational perspective, Netflix delivers the big guns. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 16.2%, outpacing nearly 84% of its peers. Its net margin pings at 14.21%, also above 84% of the industry. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg NFLX as a consensus moderate buy. Therefore, it’s an interesting idea among companies playing the artificial intelligence trend.Story continuesIBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVHistorically, IBM (NYSE:IBM) forged a reputation for undergirding leading technologies of the 20th century. However, in the current century, “Big Blue” fell behind the innovation curve, relying too heavily on its legacy businesses. Now, those days are long gone, with the company forwarding significant advancements in cloud computing. However, it’s also become a big-time player banking on the artificial intelligence trend.Predominantly, IBM garnered its AI cred based on its Watson platform, which features the ability to answer questions posed in natural language. Also, news broke recently that Big Blue has been running an AI supercomputer, developing and training large-scale AI models.As an investment, IBM stock should garner significant interest among bargain hunters. That’s because the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 14.16. As a discount to earnings, IBM ranks better than 80.1% of the competition.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg IBM as a consensus hold, which might not sound that enticing. However, their average price target stands at $143.56, implying nearly 6% upside potential. Combine that with its forward yield of 4.87% and Big Blue offers a compelling take.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs an all-around relevant market idea, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fits into almost any investment-related discussion. However, the software (and hardware) giant has been making significant inroads into the broader artificial intelligence trend. Specifically, the company heavily backed AI technology research and deployment firm OpenAI. Of course, OpenAI generated news recently for its chatbot ChatGPT.The main benefit undergirding ChatGPT centers on its ability to answer questions via natural language. Further, Microsoft launched a new version of its search engine Bing with ChatGPT integrated into it. Theoretically, this should make the platform much more useful.If so, the news should only add to Microsoft’s financial strengths. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, MSFT rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company enjoys significant strengths in the operational department. Both its long-term revenue trend and especially its trailing-year net margin rank above their respective sector median values.Currently, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $291.07, implying an upside potential of 10.63%.Deere (DE)Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.Source: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.comOn the surface, mentioning Deere (NYSE:DE), which specializes in agricultural equipment manufacturing, on a list of companies banking on the artificial intelligence trend seems somewhat ludicrous. I mean, this is a type of company that former President Donald Trump praised. After all, Trump’s a builder. Seeing him program an AI protocol would be bizarre, to say the least.However, Deere has gone well ahead of the artificial intelligence trend in its industry. In the 2022 edition of CES, Deere introduced a tractor that “…has six pairs of stereo cameras that capture images and pass them through a deep neural network – that then classifies each pixel in approximately 100 milliseconds and determines if the machine continues to move or stops, depending on if an obstacle is detected.”Financially, DE makes a lot of sense for investors thinking about the long term. Both the company’s three-year revenue growth rate and its trailing-one-year net margin rate above their respective sector median values. Plus, Wall Street believes that DE is a moderate buy. As well, its consensus price target of $482.89 implies an upside potential of 15.58%.SentinelOne (S)An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding itSource: BeeBright / ShutterstockUnfortunately, the focus on the artificial intelligence trend doesn’t just center on positive, productive endeavors. With increased digitalization comes nefarious actors, which brings us to SentinelOne (NYSE:S). Specializing in cybersecurity, SentinelOne brings plenty of relevance to the table.Cybercrimes are only increasing in scope and magnitude. In 2022, the average data breach cost $4.35 million. For the biggest enterprises, the consequences of a breach can be massive, thus necessitating advanced protection schemes. What distinguishes SentinelOne is its deployment of behavioral AI protocols. Essentially, its system can sift through mountains of data to identify legitimate threats. From there, it can also respond without needing human oversight.While SentinelOne features incredible relevancies regarding the artificial intelligence trend, it’s a risky financial narrative. Basically, prospective investors will be banking on an aspirational framework. Still, to add some confidence to the picture, Wall Street analysts peg S stock as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $19.65, implying an upside potential of nearly 29%.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs one of the biggest tech firms in the world, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is all about AI. Most notably, AI-related initiatives center on its Google ecosystem, particularly its branded search engine. Indeed, because of rising competition from Microsoft and its integration of ChatGPT, Alphabet must dig deeper. Fundamentally, I don’t see that as a problem. If I may be blunt, only losers complain about competition. Alphabet ain’t no loser.Further, what makes Alphabet special in the broader artificial intelligence trend is that it aims to use innovation for the greater good. From promoting greater worldwide access to critical technologies to developing protocols to forward environmental sustainability, Alphabet’s at the forefront of making the planet a better place.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, GOOG represents a significantly undervalued investment. Objectively, its long-term revenue growth rate and its trailing-year net margin rank above their respective sector average values. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg GOOG as a consensus strong buy. As well, their average price target stands at $124.60, implying 31.35% upside potential.Lemonade (LMND)Man in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the insurance business might not seem like a relevant arena for progressing the artificial intelligence trend. However, Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) plies its trade in the burgeoning segment of insurance technology or insurtech. Mainly, Lemonade provides critical financial protection for its subscribers. It just does it in a convenient manner that its target audience (millennials, Generation Z) natively understands.What makes Lemonade unique at the moment is that its interactions with its customers are 100% digital. This means no brokers and no middlemen. Theoretically, it also means that once the business matures, Lemonade can pass down savings to its customers. That would probably make the way insurance is done today obsolete. Further, Lemonade incorporates AI to conduct complex processes such as risk assessment and underwriting policies.To be fair, investing in LMND presents significant risks. Undoubtedly, it’s an aspirational play. About the only standout positive for the company at the moment centers on its balance sheet stability. Not surprisingly, the consensus among analysts pegs LMND as a hold. However, they also target shares hitting $23.25, implying a massive 43.7% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Companies that develop AI technologies or use AI to improve their products and services have become attractive investment opportunities for investors who want to tap into the growth potential this sector offers. And many tech giants, including Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have integrated AI into their products and services, from voice-activated personal assistants to self-driving cars.In addition to the tech sector, the healthcare industry is also adopting AI. AI is increasingly being used to diagnose diseases and develop treatments, providing new investment opportunities in this growing field.Investing in AI stocks can be a high-risk, high-reward proposition as the technology is still evolving, and the market can be volatile. That said, while investors seeking less risk can choose to invest in AI ETFs, these three AI stocks are among the best options for long-term investors right now, in my view.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAIC3.ai$21.14ORCLOracle$89.42IBMInternational Business Machines$137.35C3.ai (AI) mark stockSource: ShutterstockC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is a leading artificial intelligence software company that provides enterprise AI solutions to various industries. The company’s AI platform is designed to help organizations harness the power of AI to improve operational efficiency and make data-driven decisions. Arguably, C3.ai is the best pure-play AI stock currently available to investors.In any case, the company’s shares are clearly very volatile. C3.ai went public in December 2020, but like many high-growth stocks, AI stock has been hit hard. Despite this move, the company has received significant recognition, previously named a leader in Gartner’s (NYSE:IT) Magic Quadrant for IoT Platforms.Story continuesFrom a fundamental standpoint, C3.ai looks like a young, emerging company. Revenues reached $62.4 million in the most recent quarter, representing a 7% increase. However, the company also posted a $68.5 million net loss. That’s not conducive to many investors’ ideas of how profitable such companies should be.That said, perhaps the most encouraging aspect of this company is its subscription growth rate, at 26% year-over-year. This impressive growth suggests that C3.ai’s enterprise partners are finding utility in its products and services.Oracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is another large technology stock investing in AI to enhance its products and services.

151,d7b57261-88d2-365c-8049-4027bb80973b,MPC,2023-02-18,4 Stocks to Buy From the Thriving Refining & Marketing Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-thriving-refining-134001297.html,1676641201,STORY,"['PBF', 'MPC', 'MUSA', 'VLO', '^GSPC']","[Since coming out of the pandemic, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has witnessed strong demand across all product lines. While the rise in inflation throughout 2022 has driven costs up materially, the space continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals and strong margins. As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, refining and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Valero Energy VLO, PBF Energy PBF and Murphy USA MUSA have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureGrowing Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 5% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Strong Margins: The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs in 2022. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Inflation in the Marketplace: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. In fact, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 79.6% in the past year.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 21.8% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 17%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 6.8%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.32X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.22X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.23X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.46X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.67 billion, suggesting 1.9% growth from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The consensus mark for earnings has moved up by a penny in the past 30 days to $1.06 per share. It suggests growth of 30.9% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings is pegged at $3.86, suggesting a decline of 7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past seven days. The consensus mark for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $10.74 billion, suggesting 4.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, this leading alcohol company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.9%. The company recorded an earnings surprise of 12.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Molson Coors Beverage Company Price and EPS Surprise Molson Coors Beverage Company Price and EPS SurpriseMolson Coors Beverage Company price-eps-surprise | Molson Coors Beverage Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteMolson Coors has been gaining from robust pricing actions, a revitalization plan and the premiumization of its global portfolio. Strength across its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands, as well as its beyond-beer approach, bodes well. The company has been on track with increased investments toward core brands and innovations. These factors are expected to have aided Molson Coors’ fourth-quarter performance.Positive pricing and favorable brand and channel mix, stemming from portfolio premiumization and fewer on-premise channel restrictions, are expected to have aided the company’s fourth-quarter results.The company’s revitalization plan has been aiming to achieve sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. As part of this plan, it has been investing in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, expanding in adjacencies and beyond beer, and creating digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees. These investments are expected to get reflected in Molson Coors’ fourth-quarter top line. Also, the company’s cost-saving program has been one of the key growth drivers.TAP has been witnessing strong market share gains, driven by its innovation and premiumization efforts. In a bid to accelerate portfolio premiumization, it has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. The continued strength of the U.S. hard seltzer portfolio, particularly the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s, bodes well. This is likely to have boosted sales of the company’s above-premium beer category in the to-reported quarter.For 2022, management expects net sales growth in the mid-single digits in constant currency. Underlying EBIT is likely to increase in the high-single digits in constant currency.However, higher marketing investments in core brands, the latest innovations, and increased local sponsorship and events are likely to have led to elevated marketing costs in the fourth quarter. Also, inflationary pressures related to higher transportation costs are expected to have led to higher cost of goods sold in the quarter under review. Apart from these, global supply-chain disruptions and higher freight costs are likely to have been concerning.Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry in its Central and Eastern European regions. This is mainly due to muted disposable income stemming from inflationary pressure. TAP has been witnessing lower brand and financial volume due to sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and the continued impacts of the Québec labor strike.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected global inflationary pressures to be a headwind. Also, it expected the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries to affect its performance.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Molson Coors this time around.

Today, Waters has a strong and growing portfolio serving large molecule separation and characterization, which are approximately 30% of our pharmaceutical revenues. These applications serve high volume downstream workflows in biologic development and QA/QC Central Labs using LC-UV and LC-MS.Wyatt's significant exposure to the very fast growing biologic applications will build on this presence and will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecules, including gene therapy and viral vectors. For Wyatt, as Cliff mentioned, this combination will provide expanded geographic reach and will accelerate the adoption of light scattering and downstream applications through our established presence and empowered informatics platform. As you can tell, we're excited to share more details about the strategic benefits of this combination. However, this is our fourth quarter and our full-year earnings call, and we have some excellent results to share with you first. So now, I will cover our key messages and financial results for the core business.Then we will continue outlining the value of this combination as we take this next step in the evolution of our strategy. Looking at our financial results, we ended another very successful year delivering strong results in the fourth quarter with growth across our end markets. This was led by yet another outstanding double-digit instrument growth quarter. Our incredible performance this year would not have been possible without our dedicated and talented colleagues. We overcame numerous macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges throughout 2022, including global supply chain challenges, COVID lockdowns, inflationary pressures, and currency headwinds, all while responding to high customer demands for our products. Today, we have three key messages, which reflect the strength in our core business and the exciting future that lies ahead.First, we continue to deliver consistently strong execution. You can see this in our 2022 performance where we sustained strong growth after a stellar year in 2021. You can also see this in our three-year CAGR of approximately 9% in constant currency, where our results have placed us amongst the top players in the industry since the beginning of our transformation. Second, our revitalized portfolio has contributed to our growth and we expect this to continue. New products have resulted in growth opportunities in large molecules, applications, PFAs and battery testing, while supporting strong instrument replacement. Third, while we have accomplished a lot in the past 2.5 years, we are now augmenting our organic efforts with M&amp;A to accelerate our journey into high growth adjacencies.Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 3% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and regions with robust customer demand. Industrial was again our fastest growing end market, up 14% led by environmental testing, which grew over 20%; and TA, which grew mid-teens. Pharma saw continued robust growth, up 6% with strength in both small and large molecule applications. Strength was set by Europe, which grew low double digits, offset by headwinds in China. Academic and government grew 8% as in increased activity and funding resulted in strong year-end spending in several of our geographies. Instruments grew double-digits net by mass spec. New products contributed across our portfolio with Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier, and cyclic unit sales growing over 40% percent.Meanwhile, our newest instrument launches Xevo TQ Absolute, and Xevo G3 saw excellent continued traction with very strong demand. Recurring revenues grew high single digits supported by our e-commerce and service attachment growth initiatives. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.84. This is up 5% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 8%. For the full-year, revenue grew 7% as reported and 12% in constant currency. 2022 was a very strong year for Waters where we executed well throughout the organization against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our growth was broad-based across our geographies and end markets. Each of which grew low-double-digits or above. This strength was led by instrument sales, which grew 16% for the year with LC, mass spec, and all growing double-digits.For the full-year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $12.02. This is up 7% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 9%. Now, as we enter 2023, our end markets remain robust and healthy with strong customer demand for our products. These attractive end markets growth drivers and are well funded. We saw solid auto growth in the fourth quarter and our backlog remains at elevated levels. We expect the strong instrument sales we saw in 2022 to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. So, our end markets are healthy. We've regained our commercial momentum. Innovation has been revitalized and we have strengthened our organization with new leadership capabilities, bringing a proven track record in transformation. Now, we're entering the next phase of our execution strategy as we accelerate our path toward faster growth.This brings us now to the chart on the next slide. As you can see, biologics manufacturing is a complex process and we have shared an example which shows how large scale monoclonal antibodies are produced. It starts with the upstream production of the drug substance where the raw material components are fingerprinted and monitored during initial cell culture creation before the protein or antibody of choice is produced. Then in downstream manufacturing, cells and debris are separated from the in a series of filtration and separation steps. Each step involves numerous stages of testing to ensure that the product is stable and effective. Then as a last step, in QA/QC, the final purified drug product is formulated and filled in vials of prefilled syringes.Throughout the process, different tools and technologies are required for characterization, depending upon what you need to analyze liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or LC-UV is used extensively across all four stages. At the same time, mass spec is increasingly being used with BioAccord seeing a lot of traction in cell culture media characterization, clone selection and process optimization in both upstream and downstream manufacturing. It is also seeing adoption in QA/QC applications. We shared details on this at the beginning of the year and have included a slide in the appendix. In addition to LC-UV and LC-MS, powerful techniques such as dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering are also used to give relevant information about the size, molecular weight, and aggregation of biologics by combining the data from each of these detectors our customers can develop a more comprehensive profile of their biologics.This is essential to speeding up the manufacturing process and reducing the cost of complex biologics such as cell and gene therapies. The bioanalytical characterization market is around 1.8 billion growing around 10% to 12%. Waters already has a strong established position in LC-UV and LC mass spec, whereas Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in light scattering. Hence this combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other and will accelerate our journey in this opportunity. Let me now ask Geof to describe the company and its highly innovative portfolio. Geoff?Geof Wyatt: Thanks again, Udit. Well, Wyatt is a remarkable company and we owe much of its success in high growth applications to our amazing team. Our flagship technology is multi-angle light scattering MALS, which is used by leading biopharma, biotech, and academic institutions to measure fundamental properties of complex biologics, including cell and gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, biopolymers, biosimilars, and therapeutic protein. We're based here in Santa Barbara, California and have 225 outstanding employees of whom roughly 25% have Ph.D.'s. Over the past 40 years, we've built Wyatt into the recognized leader in light scattering detection, defining the segment very much like Waters did for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.Our sales have grown around 20% on a three-year CAGR to approximately $110 million in 2022. We're also a highly profitable business with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 40%. More than 80% of our revenues are in large molecule applications. Our biopharma customers are eager to use light scattering for QA/QC applications and have been keen for us to combine our software with Empower. So, you can only imagine how excited we are with this combination, which will add additional choices and capabilities for our existing customers and let us delight even more. Back to you, Udit.Water, Testing, LaboratoryPhoto by RephiLe water on UnsplashUdit Batra: Thank you, Geoff. I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Waters. Let's now talk about some of the benefits that integrating Wyatt and Waters' capabilities that provide for our customers. In our existing Waters portfolio, our separate complex mixtures into individual constituents for both property analysis by UV and detailed characterization by mass spec. These are properties such as titer aggregation and protein sequence. A missing piece has been additional critical information about the intact molecule, like the Empty/Full capsid ratio of adeno associated viruses or the size of lipid nano particles or mRNA therapies. These will be augmented by Wyatt's MALS detectors, which will allow our customers to develop a more comprehensive critical quality attribute profile for their biologics.This is essential to fully characterizing their manufacturing process. In each case for these tools to gain successful adoption in point of view settings, they must be: Number 1, sophisticated, but simple for use in high volume applications, such as what we've already demonstrated with BioAccord; Number 2, supported by leading service like Waters already has to help run workflows and respond to evolving needs; And Number 3, and most importantly, they need to be connected to a common informatics platform so that all the data comes together in one place. Our ambition is to create an ecosystem of sophisticated, yet simple instruments that can all use Empower to collect data and submit to regulators. No differently than what Waters established for small molecules years ago.This transaction will create a number of compelling revenue synergies and results in an attractive set of pro-forma financials. First, from a geographic footprint, Waters revenues are highly diversified, whereas Wyatt's presence is concentrated in the United States. This provides us an opportunity to expand Wyatt's geographic footprint in Europe and Asia, particularly in China. Second, HPLC instruments and size exclusion chemistry columns are sold together with light scattering instruments. We expect to see cross-selling synergies with our liquid chromatography instruments and chemistry. Third, Wyatt's instruments and expertise will enable Waters to meaningfully accelerate the high growth adjacency opportunity in bioanalytical characterization.This will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecule applications and will augment our ability to create a comprehensive bioanalytical platform. And fourth, Wyatt's portfolio is well-established in upstream development settings for large molecule applications today. Waters' Empower platform, as well as our presence and expertise in high volume down-stream recurring applications will accelerate the use of light scattering and biologics manufacturing and in QA/QC. Now, to the pro-forma. The combination will increase our large molecule footprint to around 35% of our pharmaceutical revenues. Our increased exposure to these faster growing markets will raise the combined growth profile of the markets we serve by at least 50 basis points.We expect the transaction to contribute more than 60 basis points to our annualized constant currency growth over the next five years. We also expect it to add more than 50 basis points to our industry leading adjusted operating margin. Net, we expect to realize a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five, although we expect the Wyatt business to grow low-double-digits in the near-to-mid-term. In addition, we expect this combination to create more than 70 million in annualized revenue synergies by year five. Now, I would like to pass the call to Amol to walk us through further details on the financings. He will then continue covering our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2023. Amol?Amol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. It's been great to work with Geoff, Cliff, and the entire team at Wyatt Technology. Like Udit, I'm very thankful to the Wyatt family for considering us as the rightful stewards of their mission and legacy and for providing us this opportunity to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now, to the transaction highlights. This 1.36 billion investment will result in immediate accretion of our revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin percentage. The synergies that Udit just described, along with Wyatt's highly attractive financials, are expected to result in accretive non-GAAP EPS impact as early as first quarter of 2024. Altogether, as Udit mentioned, this combination is expected to deliver a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five.We will fund this investment through cash on our balance sheet and existing debt capacity that is available on our revolver. On day one, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.3. We will temporarily suspend our share buyback program for the remainder of 2023 and will utilize our free cash flow to pay down the debt through the rest of the year. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to land at around 1.7 by year-end 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Now, to our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered an excellent close to a very strong year for Waters with constant currency growth of 9%. Waters division grew 8%, and TA grew 15%.By end market, pharma grew 6%, Industrial grew 14%, and academic and government grew 8%, which Udit already covered. By geography, sales in Asia grew 7%, Americas grew 8%, and Europe grew 11%. In Asia, growth in region overall was strong. Japan grew 25% and India grew 15%. China declined low single digits for the quarter, as a sharp increase in COVID infections at year-end resulted in delayed spending due to customer site closures. We expect these headwinds from the post-zero COVID reopening to continue into the first quarter of 2023 before catching up throughout the remainder of the year. In other regions, the U.S. grew 8% and Europe grew 11% with broad strength across end-markets. By products and services, instruments grew 10%, led by mass spec, which grew over 30%.Recurring revenues grew 7% with chemistry up 8%, and service up 7%. Finally, TA grew 15% with double-digit growth across our major geographies. Growth was led by sales in electronics, and battery applications, as well as strong growth in advanced materials and chemical testing. Looking now at our full-year results. By end market, pharma grew 10%, industrial grew 15%, and academic and government grew 13%. In pharma, growth was led by large molecule applications, which grew mid-teens, while small molecule grew high-single-digits. By geography, sales in Asia grew 12%. Americas grew 14%, and Europe grew 10%. By products and services, instruments grew 16% for the full-year with liquid chromatography, mass spec, and TA system sales all up double-digits.In our recurring revenues, chemistry grew 9% supported by our strong launch of MAX peak premier columns in large molecule applications and further expansion in digital commerce adoption. Service grew 8% with continued expansion in attachment rates, which increased 150 basis points in 2022 and have increased 350 basis points since 2019. Now, I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.4%, up 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by sales volume and pricing, partially offset by inflationary costs. For the full-year, gross margin came in as expected at 58%. Operating margin for the quarter was 33.7%, growth of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin dynamics.For the full-year, operating margin was approximately 30.2%, which was flat with last year. On an underlying basis, we expanded our operating margins by approximately 100 basis points versus our guide of 20 basis points to 30 basis points at the beginning of the year. This is net of our investments in higher growth adjacencies and despite the higher instrument mix in our revenue. On an as reported basis, our expansion was offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds and 20 basis points of additional compensation to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 17.6% and for the full-year it was 15.6%. For the full-year as anticipated, our effective tax rate increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to change regarding the capitalization of R&amp;D costs.Average share count came in at 59.6 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $3.84, compared with $3.67 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings for fully diluted share was $3.81. For the full-year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share increased 7% to $12.02, versus $11.20 in the prior year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 9%. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share was $11.73. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items.In the fourth quarter of 2022, free cash flow was 145 million after funding 62 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from this free cash flow was $8 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. In the quarter, we continued to build inventory to secure supply and build safety stock, given strong instrument demand. For the full-year, free cash flow was 506 million after funding 176 million of capital expenditures and includes approximately 100 million of additional inventory versus the prior year-end. Excluded from the free cash flow, was 32 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a 38 million tax reform payment. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well-structured debt maturity profile.This trend allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&amp;A, which will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive adjacent markets. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of our common stock for 149 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately 1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1. Now, as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2023. We have seen strong performance throughout 20 22, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across our geographies, and new product introductions driving growth. As we enter 2023, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid in our durable end markets and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance.These dynamic support of full-year 20 23 guidance of organic constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, excluding Wyatt. At current rates, negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point resulting in full-year reported organic sales growth guidance of 4% to 5.5%. We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, and depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full-year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is 6% to 8.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt. For the full-year 2023, organic gross margin is expected to be approximately 58% and organic operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Before FX, this includes 20 basis points to 30 basis points of net margin expansion after 70 basis points to 80 basis points of investment in high growth adjacencies.FX is expected to be a headwind of 50 basis points, particularly in the first half of the year. The addition of Wyatt in Q2 is expected to be accretive to our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Excluding the transaction, we expect our full-year net interest expense to be approximately 42 million. The transaction is expected to add 27 million to 43 million of additional interest expense, depending on the timing of the close. The full-year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Since we will be temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year and using free cash flow to pay down debt, our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million.Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full-year 2023 earnings for fully diluted share guidance, excluding the transaction is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90. This represents 6% to 7% growth versus last year and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. The Wyatt transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS, as early as in the first quarter of 2024. And this is even net of our share buyback suspension for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we expect it to deliver a high single digit plus adjusted return on invested capital, net of tax by year five. Due to interest expense incurred on higher debt balance, and the suspension of share repurchase program this year, the transaction is expected to result in a 2023 EPS headwind of approximately $0.15.Hence, including Wyatt, non-GAAP full-year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a two-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 with a negative currency impact of approximately 6 percentage points. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?Udit Batra: Thank you, Amol, as I outlined at the beginning of our transformation journey and later at our Investor Day last year, our first focus was to regain our commercial momentum and strengthen our organization with new leadership capabilities. As you have observed over the last 2.5 years, we have delivered incredible results with consistently strong execution, and we have assembled an amazing leadership team that brings with it a proven track record in transformation, which is pivotal to driving seamless integration. Our second focus was to revitalize our portfolio. The success of our new product launches, the increased vitality index of our portfolio, and the rich pipeline ahead of us underscores our accomplishments this year.Today, we're entering our next phase, which is to accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders by adding a fantastic fast growing technology platform. And increasing our capabilities to address high growth adjacent markets. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.Caspar Tudor: Thank you, Udit. That concludes our formal comments and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.See also 16 Best Countries in Basketball and 15 Biggest Indian Tech Companies.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Shares have added about 7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PNC Financial Down on Q4 Earnings Miss, Costs Dip Y/YThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.’s fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $3.49 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95. Also, the bottom line declined 5.2% year over year.Results were primarily hurt by a decline in non-interest income and higher provisions. However, an increase in net interest income, supported by higher rates and loan growth, and a decline in expenses were tailwinds.Net income was $1.55 billion, higher than $1.31 billion in the prior-year quarter.For 2022, adjusted earnings were $13.96 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.35. Also, the bottom line declined 1.6% year over year. Net income was $6.11 billion, higher than $5.73 billion in the prior-year period.Revenues Improve, Expenses DeclineTotal quarterly revenues were $5.76 billion, up 12.4% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 billion.For 2022, revenues were $21.12 billion, up 9.9% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.06 billion.Quarterly net interest income was $3.68 billion, which improved 28.7% from the year-ago quarter. The upswing is attributable to higher interest-earning asset yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin increased 65 basis points to 2.92%.Non-interest income fell 8.2% year over year to $2.08 billion. The decline was due to a fall in almost all fee income components, except for card and cash management fees, and lending and deposit services fees.Non-interest expenses totaled $3.47 billion, declining 8.4% from the year-ago figure. All cost components declined, except for marketing costs.The efficiency ratio was 60% compared with 74% in the year-ago quarter. A lower efficiency ratio indicates higher profitability.As of Dec 31, 2022, total loans were $326.03 billion, which grew 3.4% sequentially. However, total deposits decreased marginally from the end of the previous quarter to $436.28 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality: A Mixed BagThe company reported provision for credit losses of $408 million in the fourth quarter against the recapture of credit losses of $327 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $224 million, up 80.6% year over year.Nonetheless, non-performing loans decreased 20% year over year to $1.99 billion. Also, the allowance for credit losses declined 1.7% to $5.44 billion.Capital Position Weakens, Profitability Ratios ImproveAs of Dec 31, 2022, the Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9.1% compared with 10.3% as of Dec 31, 2021.Return on average assets and average common shareholders’ equity were 1.10% and 14.19%, respectively, compared with 0.93% and 9.61% witnessed in the prior-year quarter.Capital Deployment ActivityIn the fourth quarter of 2022, PNC Financial returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $0.6 billion and share repurchases amounting to $0.6 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.25% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PPL shares have lost about 2.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for PPL?While PPL has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PPL: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.41 on $1.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.60 on $7.39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Pinnacle West (PNW), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on February 27.This power company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -175%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 54.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Pinnacle West's revenues are expected to be $841.12 million, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thanks to a few unique touches and options, Target, Walmart and Costco take the top spots in terms of the best in-store shopping experiences, according to a new GOBankingRates survey.Good To Know: 10 Dollar Store Items That Aren’t Even Worth the BuckSee the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023When given a choice between several popular retailers — including Costco, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, IKEA, Target and Walmart — the survey finds that American consumers favor Target by far for in-store shopping, with 36% selecting it as having the best experience. In terms of age groups, Target was more favored by the 25 to 34 age group, with 47% selecting it as their top choice, followed by the 18 to 24 age group, with 41%.After Target, the survey finds that American consumers like Walmart the second most for in-store shopping, with 27%.But what makes these big-box retailers different?What Makes Target and Walmart Stand Out the Most?Shannon Vissers, retail analyst with MerchantMaverick.com, told GOBankingRates that Walmart and Target have a lot going for them when it comes to their in-store shopping experience, as the name of the game with both of these retailers is convenience.“Both stores have an in-store cafe, affordable pricing and self-checkout options,” she said. “The shelves are dependably well-stocked, the store layout is easy to navigate and there is usually ample parking. I think that even though its prices are slightly higher, Target beats Walmart because the experience is a little calmer and more aesthetically pleasing — think: better lighting, better item-merchandising, trendier design and wider aisles.”On the other hand, Walmart often locks up a lot of its high-theft items including certain toiletries and other goods, which adds a level of inconvenience and a certain distaste to the shopping experience, Vissers added, while Target benefits from having Starbucks cafes in-store — and in some cases, the carts even have cup holders, making it easier to shop and sip.Story continuesPhillipe Leblanc, co-CEO and co-founder of Funday, echoed the sentiment, saying that the retail landscape has been previously marked by the need to one-up competitors, but Walmart and Target are turning this model upside down and putting customer needs at the forefront.“From wider aisles to clear signage and an abundance of options, they are taking actions that resonate with customers — in-store and online,” he said. He also noted that if one looks at factors such as their return policies and cash-back options, “they are aiming to give back control to the consumer, which is a crucial part in long-term success.”Take Our Poll: What Are Your Financial Priorities in 2023?Why Costco’s Third Place Finish Is So Far BehindFollowing Target and Walmart for the top three best in-store shopping experiences is Costco, which is notably further behind with 13%.Merchant Maverick’s Vissers calls it “another animal”: While the bulk pricing, free samples and wide range of goods sold bring huge crowds, there are some reasons Costco falls behind the other two.“The layout is far from intuitive, and it is not a store where you can quickly find and buy what you need. The experience can be overwhelming and daunting, not suitable for a short, convenient trip. Nevertheless, many people enjoy making a half-day shopping experience at Costco,” she said.She also said that Costco’s aisles aren’t labeled, and the items therein don’t always follow a particular rhyme or reason, but this lack of organization can lead to the “thrill of discovery,” with shoppers stumbling upon new items they wouldn’t have otherwise in a traditional retail store.The Others on the List: Stores Where You Can’t One-Stop ShopThe GOBankingRates survey finds that at the bottom of the list in terms of the best in-store shopping experience are IKEA, with 9%; Dollar Tree, with 9%; Dollar General, with 4%; and Five Below, with 3%.Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, told GOBankingRates that the importance of the one-stop shop seems to have grown during the pandemic.“I suppose it’s not an entirely new trend, but especially earlier in the pandemic when many people were really afraid to leave their homes, the ability to go to one store and hopefully get everything you need is a powerful motivator,” he said. “If you feel like you’re risking your health by venturing out, you at least want to feel like it’s worth it and want to minimize the need to drive all over town and traipse up and down the aisles of a bunch of different stores.”In addition, he said that gas prices have probably taken over from COVID-19 as the primary motivator to minimize “the schlepping all over town.”“Target and Walmart have also embraced the hybrid lifestyle, offering in-store shopping, online and a mix via curbside pickup. Many people seem to like the ability to order from home, work, etc. and swing by to get the merchandise right away without waiting a couple days for shipping,” he said.More From GOBankingRatesCostco's Best Deals?

You can see this in the chart below that shows the one-year performance of Walmart relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line) and the Zacks Retail sector (red line).Since the October lows, Walmart shares are up +11.3% while the S&amp;P 500 index has gained +13.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart’s ‘value orientation’ allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers ‘trade down’ during times of ‘economic stress’. This almost ‘staple’ aspect of Walmart’s business can also be seen in the recent stock market behavior of Costco (COST) and others.Target (TGT) shares stand out for their underperformance, but that is more reflective of management’s missteps in executing in the post-Covid environment. Also, relative to Walmart and Costco, Target has a relatively smaller grocery business and has relatively more exposure to discretionary spending categories.Walmart is expected to report essentially flat earnings on +4.4% higher revenues in its quarterly report before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 21st. The market liked what it saw in the company’s last two quarterly reports on November 15th and August 16th, 2022.Target will be releasing its quarterly results a week later on February 28th. Target shares were down big in response to each of the preceding three quarterly releases, with the May 2022 release particularly notable. Analysts have generally lowered their Target estimates since the company’s last quarterly report on November 16th, while the same for Walmart has been modestly positive.  With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -48.9% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues, with 64.7% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.Story continuesThe comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers starting to report results this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 600 companies on deck to report results this week, including 60 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Nvidia, Alibaba, eBay, Home Depot and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 17th, we now have Q4 results from 407 S&amp;P 500 members or 81.4% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +5.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.3% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the EPS and revenue beats percentages in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see, there is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared. You can see this in the chart below that shows how estimates for the current period (2023 Q1) have evolved in recent weeks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.The chart below shows the aggregate earnings total for the index since the start of last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the $1.915 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.89, down from $216.09 last week and the $216.18 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.The chart below shows this 2023 index ‘EPS’ estimate has evolved since the start of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is a fairly reassuring outcome.The chart below shows the expected 2022 Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectation in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Making Sense of Earnings Estimate Revisions for Q1 FY23 and Beyond Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There could be an expansion opportunity for Visa in emerging markets, especially targeting small businesses.The Card Payment Network is expected to generate a purchase volume of $14.08 trillion in 2026, with Visa dominating the market. In addition, a potential market recovery in the second half of 2023 could boost the growth pace of Visa's key business drivers. Despite macroeconomic challenges, Visa's key business drivers, including Payments Volume and Processed Transactions, demonstrated remarkable growth and performance prospects, with 7% and 10% year-over-year increases in constant dollars during the first quarter of 2023, indicating its remarkable pas growth and positive outlook for the future.Visa Remains UndervaluedSource: Nelson ReportKey trends specific to VisaBy focusing on several key trends, Visa seems well-positioned to maintain its leadership position in the global payments technology market. These include the continued adoption of new technologies like biometric authentication and tokenization, an increased emphasis on security and fraud prevention and investments in open banking and API development. In addition, Visa has been at the forefront of promoting and adopting contactless payments worldwide, making it a pioneer in this technology. As the popularity of contactless payments continues to grow, Visa can leverage its status as a leading payment technology company to capture a significant market share.Story continuesVisa has been investing in mobile payment technology, such as Visa Checkout and Visa Direct, which enable consumers to make payments through their mobile devices. With the growth of mobile payments, Visa can leverage its technology and partnerships to expand its market share. Moreover, Visa has a strong presence in cross-border payments and can use its network to expand its reach in this area. Investing in technologies like Visa B2B Connect and Visa Direct, the company can simplify cross-border payments for businesses and consumers, further strengthening its position in this market.The financial services conglomerate has been exploring opportunities in the growing digital currency market and has launched a pilot program to enable digital currency transactions. As digital currencies gain popularity, Visa can leverage its technology and partnerships with digital currency providers to expand its offerings. Additionally, Visa is expanding blockchain technology to increase efficiency, developing new payment platforms to improve the customer experience and collaborating with fintech companies to create new payment solutions.Overall, Visa's technology and payment network are in a solid position to capitalize on these emerging opportunities in the global digital and card payment technology spaces.Crypto's potentialVisa has shown a growing interest in cryptocurrency, recognizing the increasing demand for and adoption of digital currencies globally. Visa's focus on crypto technology can be seen through several initiatives, such as partnering with digital currency exchanges and wallets, offering crypto-related services to customers and launching a pilot program to settle transactions in stablecoins.Visa's partnership with crypto exchanges and wallets has made it easier for customers to convert and spend their digital currencies at millions of merchants worldwide. For example, through a partnership with Crypto.com, the company has launched a debit card that allows users to spend their cryptocurrencies at any merchant that accepts Visa. The company has also been working on providing crypto-related services to its customers, such as allowing them to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies directly within their Visa accounts. This move by Visa enables users to access and manage their crypto assets easily. In addition, it can expand the customer base rapidly by integrating the crypto community.Finally, Visa launched a pilot program to settle transactions in stablecoins, which can reduce transaction costs and increase the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments. In 2023, I believe Visa's focus on crypto technology could push it ahead of the curve as a competitive advantage in the evolving global payments industry.Economic risksVisa is exposed to massive currency exchange rate risk, and a stronger dollar negatively impacts its financial performance and market valuations. Thus, the company experiences a considerable exchange rate risk in its daily settlement activities due to differences in the timing of rate setting and market trades for balancing currency positions.More specifically, a stronger dollar in 2023 could reduce the value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions, increase the cost of payments made in foreign currencies, reduce the revenue and margins and increase expenses. In addition, a stronger dollar can make Visa's products more expensive for foreign customers, reducing demand and market share. It could lead to a decline in its market valuations, as investors may view these factors as negative indicators for future growth and profitability.As of Sept. 30, 2022, the aggregate notional amount of its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was $3.4 billion, which can lead to a considerable change in its financial position in volatile forex conditions. A hypothetical 10% weakening in the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of around $220 million on its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts, which would largely offset corresponding gains on foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments.Visa is also subject to exchange rate risk related to translation, as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the Euro. As a result, its Euro-denominated senior notes are subject to considerable exchange rate exposure. A hypothetical 10% shift in the exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2022, would produce a foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.8 billion.Additionally, elevated interest rates will increase Visa's cost of debt in 2023, and for its customers, it can reduce spending and potentially harm its revenue. However, Visa earns a significant portion of its revenue from transaction fees, which are not directly attached to interest rates, and consumer demands appear resilient for now.TakeawayTo conclude, Visa's outlook remains positive in 2023 considering its market position, massive addressable market, expanding growth in key business drivers, brand recognition and constant innovation to improve its payment solutions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

""The share of current debt transitioning into delinquency increased for nearly all debt types.""Not all debt is created equal. Mortgages, for instance, are backed by an asset that can appreciate over time. Often the interest rate is fixed and the timeline to repay is set. Credit cards, on the other hand, come with much higher, changeable interest rates that can end up snowballing you into greater debt.That could exacerbate the divergence between stronger consumer groups and weaker ones. As borrowers struggle to pay their bills on time and delinquency rates for credit cards and other forms of debt increase, credit scores may start to take a hit.During the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, 50 million people saw their FICO 8 scores decline by more than 20 points during the depths of the economic turmoil. And nearly 21 million had their scores decline by over 50 points.Story continuesThis slide in credit is something borrowers are hoping to avoid, especially as the economy is believed to be headed toward what Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni has called ""the most widely anticipated downturn on record.""A woman carries shopping bags during the holiday season in New York City, U.S., December 21, 2022. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozOne bright spot, however, is that increased consumer spending has been propped up by a strong labor market and higher wages.“If you look at the last jobs report, over 500,000 jobs created,"" Mastercard Economics Institute Chief US Economist Michelle Meyer told Yahoo Finance on Monday. ""Wage growth is continuing and aggregate wages are clearly still picking up, and that's supporting overall spend. So a lot of that is the consumer purchasing power that reflects the health of the labor market.”Not all transactions come from a place of strength, however.Inflation tends to be stickier for some categories more than others, meaning that core and frequent purchases on necessities may carry higher costs for a sustained period of time. And as more cash is being deployed towards ""needs,"" spending on more discretionary items tends to get put on plastic or financed.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Although the increase in swiping and tapping to pay has been welcome news for credit card companies such as American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and MasterCard (MA), it's not clear how long consumers will be able to offset elevated prices through debt before they begin pulling back on spending.According to a ScoreSense report, 53% of participants said holiday spending in 2022 ""somewhat"" or ""extremely"" compounded their current debt, while 37% of respondents expressed concern about the ability to clear the debt they incurred during the holidays.And to the NerdWallet CEO's point, consumer sentiment survey data from the University of Michigan has shown hints of unease.“Overall, high prices continue to weigh on consumers despite the recent moderation in inflation, and sentiment remains more than 22% below its historical average since 1978,"" Joanna Hsu, Survey of Consumers Director, said, contextualizing the preliminary consumer sentiment reading for February. ""Combined with concerns over rising unemployment on the horizon, consumers are poised to exercise greater caution with their spending in the months ahead.”Brad Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hecla Mining Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to turn the conference over to Anvita Patil. Please go ahead.Anvita Patil: Good morning, Regina, and thank you all for joining us for Hecla's Fourth Quarter 2022 Financial and Operations Results Conference Call. I'm Anvita Patil, Hecla's Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Our financial results news release that was issued this morning, along with today's presentation, are available on Hecla's website. On today's call, we have Phil Baker, Hecla's President and CEO ; Lauren Roberts, Hecla's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Lawlar, Hecla's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Any forward-looking statements made today by the management team come under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and involve risks as shown on Slides 2 and 3 in our earnings release and in our 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC.These and other risks could cause results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures cited in this call and related slides are found in the slides or the news release. With that, I'll pass the call to Phil.Phillips Baker: Thanks, Anvita. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Hecla is the world's fastest-growing established silver miner, surprising for a 130-year-old company. And I'm on Slide 4. There are 4 reasons that this is happening. First, Hecla's commitment to silver. Since our founding, Hecla has always been a silver producer even when other metals and activities provided more margin. When I joined Hecla in 2001, investors and others encouraged us to sell or close our silver assets. But what I saw was that our large resource position can survive the ups and downs of the silver market. And we needed to be committed because the silver market would improve. And of course, it did. And because of silver's role as an energy metal, we think the silver market will strengthen further.Story continuesI'm going to talk more about that at the end of our prepared remarks. The second reason for our industry-leading growth is the foundation that came in 2008 when we purchased the 70% of Greens Creek we didn't own. This acquisition increased our silver reserves by 2.5x and provided the base and cash flow stream to further invest in the mines and others into that mine and other mines, including the Lucky Friday. And then the third reason is the investment in Lucky Friday has ultimately resulted in a new mining method, the underhand closed bench, or UCB, that is transforming this 80-year-old mine with a safer, more productive mining method that with higher grades allows it to double its historic silver production. And now the fourth reason for the growth is Keno Hill.In just 4 months since the acquisition, Keno's reserves are 1/3 higher and we produce about 2.5 million silver ounces this year and in excess of 4 million next year. Looking at the chart on the left, silver reserves are almost 5x where they were at the start of 2008 despite having produced more than 200 million ounces since then. Combining what has been replaced with the increase in reserve, Hecla has added 400 million ounces over the last 15 years. So we have 4 bodies that grow. To grow reserves and production, our strategy since 2008 has focused on large prospective land positions in the U.S. and Canada. And for a long time, the market didn't differentiate between jurisdictions, but we stayed the course with strategy. And today, whether analyst reviews reflect that the market clearly values being in the best jurisdictions, and we are in the best jurisdictions.Now looking at the chart on the right, from 2008 to 2012, we produced about 9 million ounces per year. Then we increased the average by about 50%, giving us a decade of about 12.5 million ounces. And now, we're having another 50% increase in silver production to 18 million ounces. Realize that we only show 3 years because we've not put together a long-term plan for Keno. But I expect that we'll stay at this 18 million ounces or more from these 3 mines for at least a decade. 2022 had the highest production in our history in 2023, '24, '25 and I think we're all going to set new production records for the company. And this growth doesn't require significant capital investment. Russell is going to talk about how we have the balance sheet and silver margins to achieve this and position us for even more growth.Russell?Russell Lawlar: Thanks, Phil. I'll start on Slide 6. The double-digit production growth we see -- we expect to see is being funded by our industry-leading silver margins, which have averaged more than 50% of the realized price of silver over the past few years. The direct result of these margins is the significant free cash flow generation we have seen over the past 3 years where our mines have generated more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow, including Casa Berardi's contribution of about $85 million from 2020 to 2022. In 2022, we made the decision to deploy this free cash flow in capital projects and larger equipment at the Lucky Friday mine, where we invested approximately $50 million. The acquisition of Alexco in which we've made equity investments in the loan earlier in the year of about $35 million and then an additional $20 million in development at the Keno Hill mine after the acquisition.We also invested $46 million in exploration and predevelopment programs in 2022. We did this while remaining committed to a strong balance sheet. On Slide 7, revenue for 2022 was $719 million, 39% from gold; 34% from silver; and 27% from base metals. Revenue in 2022 declined year-over-year due to lower silver prices and lower gold production with our Nevada operations on care and maintenance. Despite the lower realized prices, free cash flow generation from the 3 mines was approximately $110 million for the year, while our 2022 adjusted EBITDA declined $218 million due to the lower revenue and inflation-driven costs. Our net leverage ratio continued to be below our target of 2x. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet with $105 million in cash.We also monetized some long-term zinc hedges for approximately $17 million as zinc prices declined in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility in executing our plans. I'll now turn the call to Lauren.Metal, Mining, IndustryPhoto by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashLauren Roberts: Thanks, Russell. I will start on Slide 9. Greens Creek had another remarkable year. The mine produced 9.7 million ounces of silver seeing our guidance. Record throughput of 2,500 tons per day was achieved in the fourth quarter. In the time since we acquired full ownership of Greens Creek in 2008, and the mine's throughput has increased 20% from 2,000 tons per day to 2,415 tons per day. Equally impressive is that the recovery rate for each metal also increased during this period. Looking forward, we will continue our production ramp-up during the year and expect to achieve 2,600 tons per day in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter ASIC was higher compared to the third quarter due to higher treatment and freight costs because a silver concentrate shipment was deferred from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we conducted some seasonal maintenance activities to prepare for winter.The mine generated $120 million in free cash flow and nearly $1.9 billion in free cash flow since the mine started operations in 1989. Silver production guidance for 2023 is in line with 2022 at 9 million to 9.5 million ounces silver. Cash costs are expected to be lower at $0 to $0.25 per ounce, while the silver all-in sustaining cost is higher at $6 to $6.75 per ounce primarily due to equipment purchases and increased development as we target 2,600 tons per day. Moving to Slide 10. Lucky Friday reported a record year as the mine achieved operational milestones, including record tons processed and the highest silver production in the past 20 years. We also ratified a 6-year contract with the union, which reflects our strong working relationship and gives us the stability to continue to optimize the mine for further production growth.Silver production for the year was 4.4 million ounces. The UCB mining method is delivering impressive safety performance and production milestones at the mine. In 2022, we saw a 25% reduction in all incident frequency rate, an 11% increase in ore tons produced and a new all-time record for feet of development by company crews. Mill also is performing extremely well, delivering new all-time quarterly and annual throughput records as well as the largest ever year of zinc production. Just to put things in perspective, there has been a 68% increase in ore production since 2016, which was the last full year of production used in the previous mining method. Mine is expected to produce 4.5 million to 5 million ounces of silver in 2023 at all-in sustaining cost of $8.50 to $9.50 per ounce.Capital spend for the year will be in the range of $48 million to $51 million related to the remaining growth capital associated with the production expansion and infill drilling to support the UCB production method. 2022 marked many significant milestones to the transformation of this mine which began more than a decade ago with the sinking of the #4 shaft to access the high-grade ore we're mining today. of this success is coming from our peers as well. Lucky Friday is a recipient of the 2022 Society of Mining Engineers Murray Innovation Award for the pioneering UCB method. As I look ahead, I am more convinced than ever that the best decade of this 80-year-old mine is ahead of it, and I could not be more proud of the team leading this effort, and I am very grateful for the scores of others who have contributed to it over the years.Turning to Slide 11. Casa Berardi produced approximately 31,000 ounces of gold for the quarter and 128,000 ounces during the year. Mill continues to perform very well, achieving new throughput records. However, challenging underground mining conditions resulted in a high proportion of lower grade open pit ore to satisfy the mill. All-in sustaining cost for the year was $1,825 per gold ounce, exceeding our guidance due to lower metal production and higher production costs, driven by inflationary pressures. Casa Berardi is more exposed to inflation than our other mines because it moves and processes more material than all of our silver mines combined and there is no appreciable byproduct credit. However, even with these challenges in capital investment, the mine was near breakeven in cash flow.Our 2023 gold production guidance for the mine is reduced to 110,000 to 115,000 ounces of gold. This change reflects adjustments made to cutoff grades for inflation, fewer underground tons and more open pit tons as per the mine plan. All-in sustaining costs from the mine are expected to be $1,975 to $2,050 per ounce, higher than 2022, primarily due to lower gold production and higher sustaining capital associated with the expansion of the tailings facility. Casa Berardi remains an important asset in our portfolio that gives us scale, exposure to gold production, and exploration potential on a large and under-explored land package on the Casa Berardi break. At Keno Hill, we increased reserves by 33% to 49 million ounces of silver at 22 ounces per ton, among the highest in the world.Keno Hill would be the largest and highest grade primary gold -- primary silver mine in Canada. Development at the Birmingham and Flame &amp; Moth deposits are on track with the mill starting in the third quarter and full production of 440 tons per day achieved by year-end. Our guidance for 2023 production is 2.5 million to 3 million ounces of silver at an all-in sustaining cost of $12.25 to $14.75 per ounce. Capital spend for the year is estimated to be $42 million to $44 million as we continue development, receive more equipment and complete our mill and surface infrastructure projects. While we are laser focused on development and getting Keno Hill into full production, our confidence in the exploration potential of this district continues to grow.Moving to Slide 13. We have significant exploration success drilling 3 of our many underexplored targets. Some highlights from the program include 101 silver ounces per ton over 7 feet at Coral Wigwam, 10 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Hector-Calumet; and 19 ounces per ton over 11 feet at Silver King. These results demonstrate the strong exploration and discovery potential in the district. With this, I'll pass the call back to Phil.Phillips Baker: Thanks, Lauren. Just to comment on the exploration at Keno. When we announced the Alexco acquisition, Alexco asks if they should continue to explore, which they had a requirement to do so in either '22 or '23 because of funding. And so while, as Lauren said, our first priority was given the mine into full and consistent production, we allowed them to go ahead and continue that exploration program. And then, of course, we continued it once we closed the acquisition. We're really glad that they went forward with the program because this clearly shows that Keno has the potential to grow dramatically. Now if you'll turn to Slide 14 for our 3-year production guidance. We expect our silver production this year to increase 18% over '22 and continue to increase to as much as 20 million ounces in 2025, Keno with production between 2.5 million and 3 million ounces in Lucky Friday.That 4.5 million to 5 million drives the growth. Our consolidated silver all-in sustained cost is expected to come in approximately $10.25 to $11.50 after by-product credits. So that's consistent with where we were this past year. At today's prices, we see about $150 million of free cash flow that we're going to invest in exploration, pay dividends, maintain our land positions and invest in Casa. As Lauren noted, we've made some hard decisions to change our underground mine plant at Casa Berardi, where we've increased the cutoff grade, lower gold production, but by mining less marginal material and lowering our costs. So this year's gold production will be between 160,000 and 170,000 ounces about 110,000 to 115,000 ounces for Casa. And then we'll have a further decline to about 145,000 ounces next year for the company.With less production, all-in sustaining costs are expected to increase this year to around $2,000 per gold ounce. So we're going to make an investment net of about $20 million into Casa, so negative cash free cash flow at Casa. I realize that in the past 10 years, we've only had one other year that we've had negative free cash flow. So this is just a period of time we're more going to be investing in the tailings. We're going to be investing in surface mine infrastructure before we put the higher grade pits into production, which is going to lower the ASIC and the Casa free cash flow generating. We've changed the plan at Casa to improve the economics over 5 years, not as good economics currently, but better economics over a longer period of time.If you look at our total capital for the company, it's about $200 million, and it's split pretty evenly among the 4 operations. We also expect to invest more than $30 million in exploration predevelopment with the focus on Greens Creek for us to expand the reserves and resources. Casa Berardi on the underground targets to identify higher grade mineralization and at Keno Hill. And lastly, we're going to be focused on Keno's ramp-up, which we anticipate will cost approximately $9 million. So before we end our prepared remarks, I want to leave you all with a number, $1.1 trillion, and this is on Slide 15. The reason this number is significant is it's the amount that has been invested this past year in fossil fuels and also the same amount has been invested in renewables.And this is the first time ever this has happened. In the past, fossil fuel investment eclipsed renewables. No more. 2022 is really the tipping point. And since solar represents the fastest growing component of renewables, and it takes 0.5 million silver ounces for every gigawatt of solar panels that are installed, the appetite for silver is going to grow. So finally, I want to mention the remarkable safety performance we had in 2022. Our all-in frequency rate was 1.22 among the lowest in our history.

I got some fat fingers on this little tablet. There we go. Now, this is a year-to-date, and here is the intraday. And we're going to see a lot of red there. And in fact-- there we go-- with the S&amp;P's largest large-cap energy index, it's having its worst day since November.And this is on the back of crude oil selling off again below $80 a barrel. Saudi oil minister-- name is Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman-- he has huge sway in the OPEC+ cartel. He's doubling down on the group's agreement late last year to stop intervening in the oil market. And we see crude oil, today it was off about 3%, down to about $75, $76 per barrel. You can see it right there-- 76.34. Well, even if it went into the 60s, they're saying they're going to stand by. That would mean good prices-- good thing for consumers at the pump here.But when it comes to the energy producers, they're having a little bit of a rough go of it. Now, don't shed a tear for these guys. They had a great last year. And ExxonMobil, I'm just going to pull up a chart here. You can see over the last two years, it has more than doubled, up over 111%.DAVE BRIGGS: And it is some good news for those drivers at the pump. We're seeing gas prices, 3.42.

Interest in coal stocks waned so much that the VanEck Vectors coal ETF (KOL), the only coal ETF in the U.S., stopped trading after more than a decade of being active.Investment giants like Blackrock BLK have pushed for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies and have promised to reduce investments in companies that produce emissions. Meanwhile, clean energy has taken a bigger slice of the pie, and energy solutions such as solar have become more efficient in recent years.Expect the UnexpectedWall Street is never obvious. Knowing what occurred over the past decade, one would think that very few if any coal stocks would be in business, let alone performing well. However, that is exactly what is happening. Over the past two years, coal stocks have remained in business and quietly became market leaders and some of the top performing stocks in the entire market. For example, since 2021, public coal producers such as Arch Resources Inc ARCH have gained 283%, while Alpha Metallurgical Resources AMR is up a mind-blowing 1,097%!Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat is Driving the Stellar Performance?Coal stocks not only have scorching hot performance but are also highly ranked. The coal industry ranks 19 out of the 251 industries tracked by Zacks, putting it in the top 8%. Arch Resources, Alliance Resource Partners ARLP, and Warrior Met Coal HCC hold a best possible Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while a handful of peers such as Peabody Energy BTU earn #2 (Buy) ranks. Coal stocks are benefitting from a variety of factors, including:Story continuesClean Energy is not Enough to Meet Supply Void:Despite the advent of the green energy revolution, the increase in alternative energy has not been enough to stave off increasing energy demand in recent years.Industry Consolidation: Because many weaker coal companies went out of business a few years ago, the remaining coal companies are benefiting from soaring demand.ESG:There’s a big difference between what many of the ESG proponents are saying versus doing. Contrary to the rhetoric around decreasing emissions, firms such as Blackrock, Bank of America BAC, Morgan Stanley MS, and J.P Morgan JPM, continue to invest billions of dollars in coal and other “dirty” energy.  FundamentalsThe soaring stock prices in the coal industry are not without merit. For example, Arch Resources grew EPS by 94% year-over-year in its latest quarter, while Alliance Resource Partners’ EPS vaulted more than 300%. SunCoke Energy SXC is yet another strong coal performer. Last quarter, earnings surprised by 133.33%, and the Consensus Estimate Trend has been positive over the past 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical Picture: Breakouts GaloreWhile the coal industry has seen a meteoric rise over the past two years, most names in the group have consolidated and digested in recent months. However, following recent blowout earnings, and firm EPS estimates moving forward, the coal leaders such as ARCH and HCC look poised to continue their uptrends. Both names are examples of just some of the coal stocks breaking out. On Thursday, ARCH rocketed higher by nearly 10% on volume more than double the norm. HCC is also breaking out from a multi-month base after a strong earnings report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayIndustry consolidation, strong demand, and a lack of ESG adherence is leading to strength in the coal industry. Recent earnings have been strong, expectations moving forward are robust, and multiple stocks are staging breakouts simultaneously – a confirmation signal for technicians. For these reasons, investors should remain bullish on coal leaders such as Warrior Met Coal and Arch Resources.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

From 2025 the government plans to release a new sustainable jobs plan every five years.""Canada has what it takes to become the clean energy and technology supplier of choice in a net-zero world,"" Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a news release.Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been promising sustainable jobs legislation since 2019. But in Canada, the world's fourth-largest crude oil producer, the concept of retraining workers for clean energy jobs, also called a ""Just Transition"", became a lightening rod for criticism.In the crude-producing province Alberta, conservative Premier Danielle Smith has accused Trudeau of wanting to phase out the oil and gas sector.The Alberta government is ""perplexed"" by the jobs plan not mentioning a liquefied natural gas export strategy and has ""grave concerns"" about it not recognising the provinces' right to manage their own natural resources, Smith said in a statement on Friday.""This kind of dysfunctional communication by the federal government with our province cannot continue if Canada is to have any chance of achieving its 2050 emissions reduction targets,"" she said.The federal government said enormous clean energy opportunities are emerging in oil-producing provinces, from hydrogen to critical minerals. There will also be sustainable jobs in conventional energy industries as Canadian producers aim to lower the carbon intensity of their crude, according to the document.Story continues""Rather than a shortage of jobs, in Canada we are much more likely to see an abundance of sustainable jobs with a shortage of workers required to fill them,"" the plan said.Think-tanks Clean Energy Canada expects jobs in the sector will grow by 3.4% annually over the next decade, nearly four times faster than the Canadian average.On Thursday, Smith wrote to Trudeau offering to collaborate with the federal government on developing carbon capture and storage incentives, but only if Ottawa secured Alberta's consent on climate policies that affect oil and gas, including clean energy jobs legislation.

EXPE as the Bull of the Day and Digital Turbine, Inc. APPS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Expedia Group, Inc. is riding last year's momentum in the travel industry into 2023. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2023 and 2024 as the travel industry puts the pandemic behind it.Expedia is a global travel platform. It has three business segments: Expedia Product and Technology, Expedia Brands and Expedia for Business.It's brands includes Expedia, Hotels.com, Expedia Partner Solutions, Vrbo, trivago, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire, Wotfi, ebookers, CheapTickets, Expedia Group Media Solutions, CarRentals.com, and Expedia Cruises.A Surprising Miss in the Fourth Quarter of 2022On Feb 9, 2023, Expedia reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. It posted a big miss on the fourth quarter, reporting $1.26 versus the consensus of $1.85. That's a 31% miss.With travel demand so strong, what went wrong?Expedia said the quarter was negatively impacted by severe weather but that demand was ""markedly stronger"" since the start of the year.2022 was a strong rebound year coming out of the pandemic downturn. Booked room nights were up 26% and revenue gained 36% last year.""We begin '23 with record app usage and member counts, led by Expedia US, the first of our brands to deploy new capabilities and marketing strategies. This year, we are excited to see these benefits accrue to more of our brands and geographies, driving further growth and marginexpansion,"" said Peter Kern, CEO.Earnings Estimates for 2023 and 2024 on the RiseThe analysts are still bullish on travel, and Expedia, for the next two years. Demand is still strong.Story continues3 estimates are up for 2023 in the last 30 days, although 1 estimate has also been cut, pushing up the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $9.23 from $8.97 during that time.This is earnings growth of 35.9% over 2022 as Expedia only earned $6.79 last year.Analysts expect further growth in 2024 as well. The 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate is up in the last 30 days to $11.64 from $10.79. That's another 26% earnings growth.Shares Are CheapExpedia shares sold off in 2022 along with the other growth stocks. It declined 47% in the last year.But, along with the earnings rising, that means the stock is cheap on a classic valuation basis. It has a forward P/E of just 12.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.Expedia also has a PEG ratio of 0.9. A PEG ratio under 1.0 means a company has both growth and value. It's also a sign the stock is cheap.Expedia is shareholder friendly and has an ongoing share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it repurchased about 3.7 million shares for $347 million. It has about 18 million shares remaining under the authorization.For investors looking for a value stock in the fast growing travel industry, Expedia is one to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:Digital Turbine, Inc. is still seeing macro headwinds. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see declining earnings in Fiscal 2023 but is hopeful for a rebound later this calendar year.Digital Turbine, headquartered in Austin, Texas, is a mobile growth platform for advertisers, publishers, carriers and OEMS. By integrating a full ad stack with proprietary technology built into devices by wireless operators and OEMs, it supercharges advertising and monetization.It has offices in large cities across the United States, and in London, Berlin, Singapore, and Tel Aviv.A Big Miss in Fiscal Third QuarterOn Feb 8, 2023, Digital Turbine reported its fiscal third quarter of 2023 and missed on the Zacks Consensus. It reported earnings of $0.29 versus the consensus of $0.37.It was the company's second miss in the last 4 quarters.Revenue fell 25% to $162.3 million compared to the year ago period.""While nothing has changed regarding our long-term view of the digital media industry or our strategic positioning within the industry, macro headwinds are impacting our near-term results,"" said Bill Stone, CEO.""We expect current macro headwinds to continue into the first half of the calendar year, but our high-level strategic vision remains intact, as advertising spending tends to be among the first items to be negatively impacted at the onset of a cyclical downturn, but is typically also among the first items to rebound,"" he added.Analysts Cut Fiscal 2023 and 2024 Earnings EstimatesThe analysts are bearish given the challenging macro environment.2 estimates have been cut for Fiscal 2023 since the earnings report, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $1.18 from $1.32. This is an earnings decline of 28.9% as the company made $1.66 in fiscal 2022.Analysts also cut for Fiscal 2024 cutting the Zacks Consensus down to $1.17 from $1.40. That's just a penny less than this year but shows that the analysts, for now, think that earnings might stabilize in the second half of this calendar year.Shares Sink 85% in the Last 2 YearsIt's been rough being a shareholder of Digital Turbine the last 2 years. Shares are down 85% during that time.Even in 2023, shares are down 15.8% year-to-date after the earnings miss sent shares tumbling again.But, the good news is that they are now cheap. Digital Turbine trades with a forward P/E of 11.3. It also has a PEG ratio of just 0.8. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company is undervalued.However, investors interested in the online advertising industry might want to wait until the macro headwinds abate before jumping in.Additional content:3 Stocks to Buy on Solid Rebound in Retail SalesThe retail sector has had a hard time as soaring prices compelled people to spend cautiously. However, sales bounced back in January as inflation showed signs of easing. Demand is still high, which is helping boost retail sales. Moreover, the labor market is still going strong despite the growing inflationary pressure.This is helping people as purchasing power has continued to increase with new job additions to the economy. Given this situation, stocks like Tapestry, Inc., Conagra Brands, Inc. and Arhaus, Inc. are likely to benefit from a surge in retail sales.Retail Sales ReboundRetail sales in the United States rose a solid 3% month over month in January, beating economists' expectations of a rise of 1.9%, the Commerce Department said on Feb 15. January's jump follows a 1.1% decline in December. Excluding autos, retail sales jumped 2.3%, which was also higher than the expectations of a jump of 0.9%.The impressive numbers reported in January were driven by sales in food services and drinking places, which surged 7.2% month over month. Sales at motor dealers and parts dealers increased 5.9%, while sales at furniture and furnishings stores climbed 4.4%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 3.5%.However, receipts at gas stations remained flat despite gas prices increasing 2.4%.E-commerce, which has been playing a key role in driving retail sales since the onset of the pandemic, once again helped the sector, as online sales rose 1.3%. E-commerce has turned out to be the most preferred mode of shopping.The pandemic saw millions shopping from home in order to maintain social distancing on fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus. This made them finally realize the safety and convenience of shopping online. The trend has continued since then and has been helping the retail sector in a major way.Moreover, people have been spending more freely over the past couple of months as inflation has been showing signs of easing. Although the consumer price index (CPI), the preferred gauge of measuring inflation, increased 0.5% in January, inflation has slowed in the prior months.Another reason that has been helping the retail sector is the solid job additions to the economy. The job market is still doing well despite rising inflationary pressures that have forced individuals to spend cautiously.The labor market remained resilient in 2022 and this year too, it has been good so far.The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased a solid 517,000, which came in above economists' expectations of a modest 187,000 increase. This follows job gains of 260,000 in December.This came as the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, its lowest level since 1969. With jobs being added at an aggressive pace, people will get more money in hand, which will help them spend more.Our ChoicesThis is thus the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have both a strong offline and online presence.Tapestry, Inc. is a designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally.

But it's been around for decades here. So now the buzz around AI is larger than ever, thanks to tailwinds from ChatGPT, which has seen its usership explode since it opened for public testing in late November. But is the AI hype cycle nearing its peak, or is the round of AI developments just the start of even wider adoption?So to help us answer these questions, let's bring in and get to identify.com CEO and Apple App Store's founding director Phillip Shoemaker. Phillip, great to have you here with us today. Help us go further into this conversation of where to next in terms of the early phases of generative AI and where that adoption and even user cases are starting to emerge.PHILLIP SHOEMAKER: Yes, thank you for having me. It's been a long time since we had an AI hype cycle like this, right? I think it was the '80s when people like Gary Hendricks and Marvin Minsky were pushing this. And there was all this investment in AI in the '80s, and it went absolutely nowhere. So I'm happy to finally see it resurrecting. And we're seeing a lot of use cases now in things that are a little simpler to solve like machine vision, being able to recognize a person, being able to recognize faces, being able to recognize different types of products and people in general and objects.So machine vision is coming along really far. But the big thing, I think, we're seeing is that the internet has this boom of this data capture, right, where all our data is being captured all the time. And that makes it amazing for AI's to be able to train. I mean, as you just heard from the ChatGPT stuff, it depends on what you train it on. If you're training it on only wokeism, all you're going to get out of it is wokeism, right? So you need to train it on everything out there so it generates its own opinions, and you get some good data on it.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: And one of the things you said in your note to us that was interesting is that no AI company has ever turned a profit. I mean, of course, many of the companies doing AI now are already very profitable at other stuff, right? So that seems to be changing the calculation a little bit. We had just put up on the screen a minute ago some of what you're dubbing the potential winners in this group. And some of those are examples, like an Nvidia or AMD. How are they going to capitalize on this? Why are they going to be winners?PHILLIP SHOEMAKER: Well, these guys, I think just like in the crypto space, the biggest winners have been those that are working on picks and shovels, like in the gold rush, right? Don't actually go and mine the gold. Create the genes. Create the picks. Create the shovels. And those are the companies that have long lasting value.And in this case, companies like AMD and these chip makers, AMD, et cetera-- of course, Microsoft and Google, Alphabet-- but these chip manufacturers are the ones that are making it really easy to be able to handle and power these AI systems. So I think the picks and shovels makers in the AI space, much like in the crypto space, are the ones that you should hold on to because they're going to make-- generate a big profit.Now, what I said about the pure AI companies, historically, since the '80s, people have been investing a lot in AI. And it's given us little teeny improvements here and there. This has been a long time research effort for most of these AI companies that were only starting to see fruition. So the ROI on these things is incredibly long, but these chip manufacturers, these ones that are leading the way there and starting to build their own tools and their own AIs to boot are the ones that I think we're going to see great success with.BRIAN SOZZI: Phil, we mentioned before the AI companies looking to maybe build in something like wokeism or whatever it is. Are there any safeguards being put in place to prevent biases like that?PHILLIP SHOEMAKER: Yeah, I think that's one of the issues that we're seeing, is that I think most are going to be putting in safeguards. But here's the problem with any sort of war, right? And where the AI wars have just begun-- and I don't mean AI's and Terminator type of thing. I'm talking about just these companies that are battling against each other to have the strongest AI out there. So what's going to happen is they're going to start adding features too quickly that have unintended consequences and could be dangerous, right?So imagine if a ChatGPT was trained on saying things like saying that, like, 9/11 is fake or that vaccines are bad, that could be really detrimental to the environment or to our survival as well. So I think that's one of the biggest things, is that we don't know what safeguards there are. We don't have any laws or regulations in place that tell these companies what safeguards to put in. But boy, we need something along those lines because we find that if you don't regulate it, if you don't have a policy, these things can get out of hand.BRAD SMITH: Phil, I mean, it sounds like we're overgeneralizing the use of wokeism and kind of truncating a few topics together. So to just to be super clear about this, there are things that have definitively happened in history that we know for a fact are bad or have other factual elements that are around them that we all know to be true. But the interpretation has been misguided or, in some cases, perversely used. So how can we ensure that that is not something that makes it into generative AI?PHILLIP SHOEMAKER: Yeah, there's two types of training of these AI systems. And as I said, we have so much data out there that we can train a lot of good AI's. But there's two types of training. One is supervised, and one is unsupervised. The unsupervised training is what you're seeing now. You're seeing ChatGPT and others just accessing a lot of data, grocking it, understanding it, getting it into their vernacular, getting them to understand it.That causes a problem because if they just go strictly based on the information that's out there, we know there's a lot of falsities out there, a lot of lies that people will spread on the internet. And so people need to supervise and say, this is true, this is false, and put it into the system. And that's difficult to do. Having a lot of data means that you have to have a lot of people sort through that data and make determinations on what's accurate and what's false.And sometimes, us humans make those incorrect statements. I mean, if you look at history lessons, a lot of our children get these history lessons wrong. They don't know what happened in the past is factual. But look, if they start bringing in real history books and things along those lines and start understanding that, we'll be in better place. So it's all about supervised training with the AI.BRIAN SOZZI: Identity.com executive director and founding director of the Apple App Store, Phillip Shoemaker, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon.PHILLIP SHOEMAKER: Thank you.]"

This was primarily due to lower Sequel II/IIe placements and currency fluctuations in the pound sterling and euro, which resulted in a 7% headwind.This figure compares to our fourth-quarter projection of $4.5 million.Segmental AnalysisProduct revenues amounted to $22.8 million, down 26.9% from the prior-year quarter.

Adjusted total operating expenses of $87.6 million climbed 10.4% year over year.The adjusted total operating loss totaled $78.6 million in the reported quarter compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted total operating loss of $62.4 million.Financial PositionPacBio exited the full-year 2022 with cash, cash equivalents and investments (excluding short-term and long-term restricted cash) of $772.3 million compared with $1.04 billion at the end of 2021.GuidancePacBio has initiated its financial outlook for 2023.The company expects to achieve revenues in the range $165 million to $180 million, representing growth of 29-40% from comparable 2022 figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $178.3 million.Our TakePacBio exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues. The company saw a robust increase in its Consumables revenues during the reported quarter. Robust performance in the Asia-Pacific region is also encouraging. Continued strong prospects for the company’s Revio and Onso systems, with customers placing orders for them, looks promising for the stock. The recent launch of the Paraphrase tool, which was confirmed during the fourth-quarter earnings call, augurs well. PacBio has entered into a few collaborations over the past few months, which looks promising.Yet, dismal top-line and bottom-line results are disappointing. The year-over-year fall in both Service and other revenues and product revenues is concerning. The fall in Instrument revenues and continued adjusted loss per share incurred by the company are also worrying. Lower revenues from the Americas and EMEA are worrying. The contraction of the adjusted gross margin does not bode well. The year-over-year operating loss for the company is another area of concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksPacBio currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

An improvement in overall top-line and bottom-line results and robust domestic revenues are impressive. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures is promising. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures is encouraging as well. The robust performance of Nevro’s new AI-powered HFX iQ Spinal Cord Stimulation System in the limited market release with positive feedback from physicians and patients raises optimism about the stock.In January, Nevro announced the presentation of favorable complete 24-months PDN RCT trial data and the 12-month Quality of Life RCT data, which raises optimism about the stock.On the flip side, lower-than-expected earnings in the reported quarter and dismal bottom-line performances are disappointing. Lower international revenues on a reported basis are discouraging as well. The sustained operating loss incurred by Nevro also raises our apprehension. The contraction of the gross margin also does not bode well.

The fourth-quarter decline in revenues was mainly the result of lower COVID-related sales compared with the year-ago period as well as continuing supply chain constraints.On a positive note, on a geographic basis, the company experienced double-digit currency-neutral year-over-year core revenue growth in the Americas and Asia, while Europe posted a more modest increase, primarily reflecting ongoing supply chain constraints for diagnostic products.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBio-Rad currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Teladoc (TDOC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.20 a share, just five days from its upcoming earnings release on February 22, 2023.TDOC has an Earnings ESP figure of 25.93%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.20 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.27.TDOC is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McKesson (MCK).Slated to report earnings on May 4, 2023, McKesson holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $7.17 a share 76 days from its next quarterly update.For McKesson, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.05 is 1.67%.Story continuesTDOC and MCK's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The Technology and Workforce Solutions segment’s revenues are expected to decline 10-12% from the prior-year figure.The company projects first-quarter revenues at the Physician and Leadership Solutions segment to decline 10-12% from the prior-year figure.Our TakeAMN Healthcare exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The company recorded robust performance across the majority of its core segments in the quarter.Management confirmed that high vacancies and voluntary turnover in healthcare are continuing to support demand for AMN Healthcare’s total talent solutions. Management also confirmed that despite tough year-over-year comparisons, the company’s fourth quarter results exceeded its expectations for all business segments.The continued strength in AMN Healthcare’s Language Services also looks promising. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well for the stock.However, AMN Healthcare’s dismal top line and bottom-line performances are disappointing. The Nurse and Allied Solutions segment’s revenue decline during the reported quarter is worrying. The contraction of the adjusted operating margin raises our apprehension about the stock.AMN Healthcare expects to register a decline in its overall top line and all its segments in the first quarter of 2023, which is concerning. The company’s reliance on third parties and operation in a stiff competitive space are other headwinds.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksAMN Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

For the company, dealing with the continuous shortage of clinical labor, nursing in particular, has been challenging. Mounting costs and expenses and the contraction in the adjusted operating margin are other downsides.In 2023, Amedisys remains confident about generating approximately $50 million in revenues from Contessa Health, the company’s newly formed high-acuity segment, driven by increased volumes from their current and signed JV partners.The company has kept several growth opportunities in its pipeline.

(NYSE:APD) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of May to $1.75. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 2.5%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 2,306% of cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 46.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 49% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAir Products and Chemicals Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.56, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $7.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Air Products and Chemicals has impressed us by growing EPS at 16% per year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.In SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Air Products and Chemicals will make a great income stock. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Air Products and Chemicals is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

(AP) — To millions of viewers, Fox News hosts gave allies of former President Donald Trump a platform to champion false claims that he lost the 2020 election because of voter fraud. To one another, they expressed doubts about the claims and mocked the people making them.Private exchanges between Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, and other network bigwigs — including the chairman of Fox Corporation, Rupert Murdoch — show a wide chasm between what the network promoted in primetime and the doubts that its stars held behind the camera, according to new court filings in a defamation lawsuit being waged by a company whose voting systems were regularly maligned on air.“Sidney Powell is lying” about having evidence for election fraud, Carlson said via text on Nov. 16, 2020 to a Fox News producer, referring to one of Trump’s lawyers.Ingraham texted Carlson that Powell is “a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy,” referring to the former New York mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani.These and other internal communications were included in a redacted brief filed Thursday by attorneys for Dominion Voting Systems, which is suing Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, for $1.6 billion.In a deposition, host Sean Hannity said “that whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, I did not believe it for one second,” according to Dominion’s filing.Murdoch, meanwhile, in a Nov. 19 email, described what he saw in a press conference that day featuring Giuliani and Powell as “Really crazy stuff. And damaging.”Dominion's legal case rests on its belief that Fox News employees deliberately amplified false claims that the company had changed votes in the 2020 election, and that Fox provided a platform for guests to make false and defamatory statements.Attorneys for Fox argued in a counterclaim unsealed Thursday that the lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. They said Dominion has advanced “novel defamation theories” and is seeking a “staggering” damage figure aimed at generating headlines, chilling protected speech and enriching Dominion’s private equity owner, Staple Street Capital Partners.Story continues“Dominion brought this lawsuit to punish FNN for reporting on one of the biggest stories of the day — allegations by the sitting President of the United States and his surrogates that the 2020 election was affected by fraud,” the counterclaim states. “The very fact of those allegations was newsworthy.”Fox attorneys have noted that Carlson repeatedly questioned Powell’s claims in his broadcasts. “When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her,” Carlson told viewers on Nov. 19, 2020.Fox attorneys say Dominion’s own public relations firm expressed skepticism in December 2020 as to whether the network’s coverage was defamatory. They also point to an email from Oct. 30, 2020, just days before the election, in which Dominion’s director of product strategy and security complained that the company’s products were “just riddled with bugs.”In their counterclaim, Fox attorneys wrote that when voting-technology companies denied the allegations being made by Trump and his surrogates, Fox News aired those denials, while some Fox News hosts offered protected opinion commentary about Trump’s allegations.“Freedom of speech and freedom of the press would be illusory if the prevailing side in a public controversy could sue the press for giving a forum to the losing side,"" Fox attorneys wrote.Fox attorneys warn that threatening the company with a $1.6 billion judgment will cause other media outlets to think twice about what they report.Responses by both sides to the briefs made public on Thursday remain under seal. Fox has said Dominion's filing includes “cherry-picked quotes stripped of key context,” and that it has refused to allow Fox to make its response to Dominion's brief public. Attorneys for Fox and Dominion told The Associated Press on Friday that responses to the briefs will remain under seal until Feb. 27.Dominion on Friday filed its own challenge to the redactions in the briefs, including its own. “Dominion’s position is that nothing in these three briefs warrants confidential treatment,” attorneys for the company wrote, adding that all redactions were done at Fox's request.If either side can persuade Superior Court Judge Eric Davis to grant summary judgment in its favor, the case will end without a jury trial. If not, the trial is scheduled to begin in mid-April.In its 192-page brief, Dominion said the judge should rule in its favor because “no reasonable juror could find in Fox’s favor on each element of Dominion’s defamation claim.” Dominion attorneys also assert that no reasonable juror could find in favor of Fox’s “neutral reportage” and “fair report” defenses.“Recounts and audits conducted by election officials across the U.S. repeatedly confirmed the election’s outcome, including specifically that Dominion’s machines accurately counted votes,” Dominion’s filing states.Fox News attorneys argue the network’s coverage and commentary are not defamatory and that there is no evidence the hosts had any malicious intent behind what they said about Dominion — an important legal standard in First Amendment cases.Davis ruled last month that, for the purposes of the defamation claims, he will consider Dominion to be a public figure. That means Dominion must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Fox defendants acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.]"

(NYSE:CMI) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$1.57 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-nyse-cmi-passed-120957891.html,1676722197,STORY,['CMI'],"[Readers hoping to buy Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Cummins' shares before the 23rd of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 9th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.57 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.28 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Cummins has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current share price of $257.47. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Cummins Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Cummins paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 82% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's positive to see that Cummins's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Cummins has grown its earnings rapidly, up 20% a year for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Cummins has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineIs Cummins an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Cummins paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Cummins, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

More than 2,300 staffers have signed a new petition to get Iger to reconsider the return-office-mandate, The Washington Post reported Thursday.""There is value in being together, but we also need to look forward and embrace new paradigms that add value,"" the petition says.The employees argue that policy will have “unintended consequences” that could harm the company, including “forced resignations among some of our most hard-to-replace talent and vulnerable communities,"" which could lead to dramatically reduced “productivity, output, and efficiency.""Staffers with disabilities, young children, or other issues that require remote work all gave testimonials in the petition, the Post reported.""I think everyone has adjusted really well to the flexibility at Disney that was rolled out during the pandemic,"" an unnamed employee told the outlet. ""For that to all go away suddenly was really scary for a lot of people.""""Flexibility at Disney really felt like a fresh start,"" another employee said. ""Now it feels like we're moving backwards.""Iger returned as the CEO of Disney in November, after leaving the company for just 11 months. In his first 15-year tenure, the 72-year old former president of ABC managed to increase Disney’s net income by over 400%, partly by adding top tier brands like Marvel and Pixar to the fold.The news of employee push back against Iger’s return-to-office mandates comes after the CEO laid off 7,000 workers as a part of a cost-cutting move earlier this month. But despite their protest, the petition that includes more than 2,300 staffers is just a drop in the bucket for a company that has more than 200,000.Story continues“The work we are doing to reshape our company around creativity, while reducing expenses, will lead to sustained growth and profitability for our streaming business, better position us to weather future disruption and global economic challenges, and deliver value for our shareholders,” he said of the layoffs in a statement.Disney is far from the only Fortune 500 company to require employees to return to the office over the past year. From Big Tech giants like Apple to financial services firms like Vanguard Group, a number of U.S. firms have been attempting to get workers back to the office after the pandemic, with varying degrees of success.Last month, the CEO of Morgan Stanley quipped that working remotely was “not an employee choice.” And Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon famously told his staff remote work was “not a new normal” more than a year ago, but the company is still struggling to reach pre-pandemic attendance levels at its Manhattan headquarters. Although building occupancy rates in most major cities have rebounded this year, they still remain well below pre-pandemic levels as many remote workers continue to push back on return-to-office mandates.Jose Maria Barrero, an assistant professor of finance at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), told Fortune’s Jane Thier earlier this month that CEOs might have to accept that some their workers will never return to the office.“I do think there will be a ceiling for workplace attendance,” he said, arguing that 60% in-office attendance may be the most execs can hope for these days.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

But no matter the answer, inflation has certainly hit us consumers hard this past year. Prices are up nearly 6.5% from a year ago. And it's causing people to make some very tough choices about what to spend their money on.There's one media organization, though, out with new data, showing that the state of streaming remains very strong, spending on streaming rising more than 17% last year in 2022, topping $30 billion. This is according to data from Digital Entertainment Group. So here with more on that, we want to bring in Jon Niermann, Loop Media CEO and co-founder.Jon, it's great to have you, lots to get into here when it comes to the world of streaming. But first is your assessment. Given the insight that you have at Loop Media, how strong is streaming right now? And how much of that jump do you think is just a result of more people cutting the cord?JON NIERMANN: I think it's very strong. I think it'll continue to get stronger. People love choice. They like to customize what they watch, when they want to watch it. Streaming offers that perfect solution. You've got a plethora of choices out there right now. So it's getting a little confusing. But the state of streaming will continue to grow across all different platforms, whether they're free or subscription.- I'm just curious, before we move on to some Disney stories, do you think that increased spending is just more a reflection of the cord cutting acceleration?JON NIERMANN: It is. You get a majority of the people now who finally have figured it out. I'll give Disney credit for that. In 2019, I think that really tipped into the mainstream. Prior to that, people hear about Pluto, Hulu. They're not really sure what all that means. But you're pretty clear about what Disney means. So I think that really enable people to jump in the streaming boat, if they haven't done it before. So I just feel like there's just something for everyone, like I said.Story continues- All right, so you were the President of Walt Disney International Asia-Pacific in the early 2000s, Disney facing some questions about what it will do with Hulu. The company currently has a 2/3 stake in the streaming platform, while Comcast has the other 1/3. In '24 Disney has the option to acquire Comcast's stake in Hulu or sell it. Here's what Needham Senior Media Analyst Laura Martin had to say about what she thinks they'll do.LAURA MARTIN: As you look at the Disney track record, including the 15 years under Iger, they don't sell anything. They just buy stuff. And even it's a $70 billion Fox assets. They aren't sellers of assets. So I'd be shocked if-- but I think what he's trying to put Comcast on notice, is if Comcast wants to charge four times as much for their third of Hulu than he wants, Bob Iger is going to say, no, no, we're going to put it to you at that value. So I think he's trying to negotiate a more fair price for what Comcast is going to ask for his third. But based on his track record, I would guess they end up owning the last third of Hulu, not selling it to Comcast.- Jon, what do you think Bob Iger will do?JON NIERMANN: She's going on red. I'm going to go on black, and here's why. I think if you kind of look historically, I started at Disney in the '80s, and I saw a lot of experimentation. Go back to how cool was it they turned a movie into an NHL franchise with the Mighty Ducks in '93. And then they bought ABC. With ABC, came ESPN. So now you're going deeper on sports. Well, let's buy the Anaheim Angels.So you try and create this thing, but then we don't want to be a sport owners. So in fact, they do shed things, pre-Bob, obviously. Then look at the studios. So you had Walt Disney Studios. And you wanted to go a little bit broader, and you had to make more colorful movies, so you start Touchstone. And then from there, you go into Hollywood Pictures.So Disney throws a lot of wars in the water, from my experience. And I think over time, they explore it. And maybe some of them work. Some of them don't. I think it's the same thing with Hulu. I think that in to mid-2000s, whenever they start streaming, they're testing it. And they're kind of sleeping with the enemies with NBC and Fox and everybody. And over 10 years, they learn, decide, hey, if we put all of our own content into one place, that's a better model.So I just don't see any real value there. You either do this thing because there's a strong strategic purpose or because it's really profitable. I don't know the numbers on it, don't know if it's profitable. But if Disney is looking to cut cost, I don't really see the strategic value, personally. I see much more of a strategic value for Comcast because I think it's a much better play than Peacock, Zumo, and whatever else they've done.- So Jon, that's Hulu. What about ESPN? Because Iger reorganized the company. ESPN is now its own division, some talk about whether or not that could mean that Disney maybe is getting ready to spin off ESPN. You know, Iger said that that's not in the plans, at least for now. What do you think makes the most sense when it comes to Disney's future with ESPN?JON NIERMANN: That's the one I can't see them touching. I mean, again, they bought ABC back in 1995 for $19 billion. I think ESPN on its own is worth over $50 billion now. It is the hallmark of sports broadcasting. It will continue to be, as far as I'm concerned. The regional networks never really took a bite out of it. So I don't know why you would shed that. It's just such a great franchise for them. And it's made money for them. It's done all sorts of great things. That's an area of focus. ESPN's great. It stands out on its own. Hulu's general entertainment. They don't need that to bolster Disney or find a place for their content.- This was great, Jon. You got to come back and see us. Got a lot more questions about this media landscape. Unfortunately, we're out of time. Loop Media CEO. Great to have you, sir.]"

Senior Media and Internet Analyst Laura Martin joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the outlook for streaming stocks, including Disney’s content plans for ESPN and Hulu, potential WWE acquisitions, and the future of YouTube without CEO Susan Wojcicki.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: All right, let's talk more on streaming. Paramount's streaming platform, Paramount+, reported losses widening to $575 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, just one of the media giants feeling the pain as a slowdown in the advertising market and macroeconomic headwinds impacting the consumer combine with high content costs to create what some might see as a perfect storm. Joining us now is Laura Martin, Needham and Company senior media and internet analyst. Always nice to see you, Laura.So let's talk about what we've learned the last couple of weeks from some of these earnings reports Seana alluded to. And what do you think really will define this year in streaming? Is it going to be bundling? Is it going to be cost cutting? Where are we?LAURA MARTIN: So I think content costs are going to come down. I think that competition is-- these losses are too high. Wall Street is not going to tolerate these losses in 2023. So you're going to see competition for content coming down for anything in the B and C category. And I think the Wall Street really wants profitability.So what that means is, we've had Disney say in their earnings that they're going to start reallocating content back into the linear TV ecosystem, because they want to elongate that revenue stream as long as possible. And I think you're going to see content costs getting under control because Wall Street is insisting that that happen.SEANA SMITH: Laura, what is your takeaway, drilling down a little bit deeper into Disney? Certainly a number of changes that were announced from Iger on that most recent earnings call, cutting 7,000 jobs, targeting $5 and 1/2 billion in savings, questions about where that leaves ESPN. What do you think?Story continuesLAURA MARTIN: So I really like the fact that they're breaking ESPN out as a separate category for the first time in 20 years. And I think the reason is because when they walk-- what Iger's really good at is differentiating his voice, right? That's why he's going to get rid of all general entertainment and go back to those franchise properties of Marvel and Star Wars and princesses. That's smart because it's differentiated content, and he can charge a price premium.Similarly, ESPN, if I'm walking in to bid against others-- he's paying a billion 5 right now for NBA rights. When I walk into the NBA, I think Disney can say, look, we'll pay you 2 and 1/2 billion, or we'll give you-- we'll pay you a billion and we'll give you 2% of ESPN equity. So suddenly that bid looks really differentiated, compared to somebody who gives them $2 billion in cash from Apple, for example.So if I was them, I would take the equity in ESPN, but breaking out ESPN separately allows him to do that. So he has said he's not looking to sell ESPN, but I wouldn't be surprised if he uses it in a clever bidding competitive advantage for some of these sports rights that come up over the next three years.DAVE BRIGGS: That is a theory I had not heard nor thought about and a brilliant one. OK, I want to switch over to Hulu, and they own about 2/3 of it. Prevailing wisdom was they buy out the remaining 1/3 from Comcast, but now it seems like this sentiment has shifted towards they might sell. Where are you on Disney's Hulu future?LAURA MARTIN: So I do know that made news when Iger said he'd be willing to sell. And I think it's about price. At the end of the day, as you look at the Disney track record, including the 15 years under Iger, they don't sell anything. They just buy stuff. And even it's a $70 billion Fox assets, they are sellers of assets. So I'd be shocked if-- but I think what he's trying to put Comcast on notice is if Comcast wants to charge four times as much for their 1/3 of Hulu than he wants, Bob Iger is going to say, no, no, we're going to put it to you at that value.So I think he's trying to negotiate a more fair price for what Comcast is going to ask for his 1/3. But based on his track record, I would guess they end up owning the last 1/3 of Hulu, not selling it to Comcast.SEANA SMITH: Laura, one of the parts in your note that really stuck out to me about Disney was just technology shifting authority away from the distributors, the producers, to the consumers. How, then, does the distributor, the consumer, get back some of that control?LAURA MARTIN: So that was Iger's assessment on the call. And I thought sort of thought we pushed back. It's a really interesting insight. And so Bob Iger is pushing our thinking forward. I do think that these big FAANG companies like Apple and Amazon really are locked down on consumer first. I'm not sure that's true of content. I think storytellers sort of do have a story they want to tell. And if they're successful, they bring the audience along, like ""Avatar,"" for example.But the consumer isn't asking for ""Avatar."" Content is ahead of the consumer, and then the consumer has to adopt. So I'm not sure in the content storytelling business that the consumer is demanding these stories. I think brilliant storytellers tell them, and then the consumer adopts. So the way they get it back is they bundle. Disney's doing the best job of this, not only bundling. If you go to the parks, they give you a discount on Disney+. If you're a Disney+ sub, they give you a discount on the parks-- smart.The data acquisition that Disney's got in 360 degrees for all their consumer touchpoints, they're using much more effectively. That's where the world is going, is using data on your superfans to charge a premium price and to get them to keep those consumer revenues in their ecosystem, not leak out to Paramount or leak out to Fox or leak out to Apple or Amazon.DAVE BRIGGS: Speaking of a premium price, word has it that Vince McMahon is looking for 9 billion for WWE. That's according to Bloomberg. Stock popping today about 2%, but up 30% on the news of a perceived sale. Any other streaming giants you think could be in line, could afford that price tag, or any theories who else might step in, other than the Saudis?LAURA MARTIN: Sure. I think-- look, I think $9 billion is a lot to Vince McMahon and to shareholders. It's not a lot for Apple. It's not a lot for Amazon. It wouldn't be really a lot for Comcast. So the guys that have those rights today on SmackDown or the Fox ecosystem, like the Fox enterprise and the Comcast enterprise, it's a little rich for Fox, I would say, because they're smaller.But certainly, hey, you want to play in the streaming wars, you better have deep pockets that can buy-- right, Vince owns 100% of his content for wrestling forever. He bought it. That's the first thing he did when he took it over from his dad, is roll up all the library content for wrestling from the beginning of time. So to own that library of that special, like, niche audience-- really valuable. I don't know if Vince will get 9. It's smart of him to ask for 9. But if it came in at 7 or 6, like, I mean, every streaming guy that's going to survive can afford that price point.SEANA SMITH: Laura, let's talk about one of the other dominant players in the streaming space. That is Google, YouTube. CEO Susan Wojcicki leaving, stepping down from that chief executive position. A YouTube without Susan, what does that look like? And what do you think that tells us, just about the strategy of YouTube going forward?LAURA MARTIN: Look, these numbers have been quite weak. Last quarter, YouTube ad revenue was down 8%. The quarter before was down 2%. It has been decelerating for five quarters. You know, Wall Street is calling for the head of the CEO. So this is what happens. The CEO fires other people instead or moves them out first to see if he can save his own job. So I'm not-- I wouldn't be surprised with these numbers Google's putting up if they replace everybody, and the CEO tries to keep his job. It wouldn't surprise me if even the CEO cannot keep his job if they don't report a better quarter next quarter.SEANA SMITH: Wow, Laura, we're going to have you back on to talk a little bit more about that. Laura Martin, always great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

I'm excited to be with you for my first earnings call as CEO of Exelon and one that concludes a very successful year for us. When I first joined ComEd in 2008, it was one of two utilities along with PICO under the Exelon umbrella. We recognized that we had an opportunity to take advantage of the power of the Exelon platform in a meaningful way. The company was already known for building world-class operations in the generation business commonly known as our management model. Over the course of the next 14 years, we applied the same principles of best practice sharing and accountability through performance measurement to our energy delivery business. We were building a standard of excellence to deliver improvements in reliability, safety, customer satisfaction and value.I was fortunate and privileged to be part of guiding this evolution first as the lead to ensure the Constellation merger crossed the finish line in 2012 then in my role as CEO of BGE and eventually as CEO of Exelon Utilities and COO of Exelon. In those positions, the leadership teams and I were able to challenge our talented employees to take our utilities to the next level. We sustained and expanded our operational excellence, improved customer satisfaction, enhanced team diversity and improved earned ROEs from mid single digits to our 9% to 10% target first at BGE and then at PHI. And as you'll hear today, 2022 gave us a chance to showcase what we've built, an ability to execute, push continuous improvement, and achieve a balanced outcome for our customers and investors.But as proud as I am about what our team has built, I'm more excited about what lies ahead and I want to layout our vision of who we are and what supports our value proposition. Exelon is the premier T&amp;D company in the industry. Our platform is stable with sound fundamentals both operationally and financially. This platform positions us to support our jurisdictions through the multi-decade energy transition that is just starting. We can do it in a manner that supports affordability and equity while driving consistent stable growth for our shareholders, the type of performance that is a hallmark of a top tier utility. What makes our platform unique? Well, we have an extremely diversified investment plan in size, scope, and location. We have no generation.We have worked with our jurisdictions to operate under forward-looking rate mechanisms that provide value for our customers and predictable results for our investors and almost three quarters of our revenues are decoupled. This leads to a very compelling risk adjusted total return of 9% to 11% built on the foundation of an unmatched platform, operational excellence and strong partnerships with our jurisdictions and communities. The Exelon team has proven its ready to meet the challenge of leading the nation in its energy transformation, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and our communities while creating value for our shareholders. I will now turn to Slide 5 and talk about our key messages for this call. I will start by recapping the strong performance in 2022.We executed right in line with our expectations, reporting operating earnings results of $2.27 per share. That exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $0.02 and represents 8.1% growth off of the 2021 guidance midpoint. We also had best on record operating performance at three of our four utilities. As for our rate case activity, we had four constructive distribution rate case outcomes, including two gas cases and two electric cases. We'll look to continue this progress in 2023 with several important rate cases this year. In January, ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission its first multiyear rate plan and grid plans under the framework established by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The filing follows 15 stakeholder workshops, reaching more than 1,000 attendees as well as 45 stakeholder presentations.As Illinois progresses towards its decarbonization goals, ComEd is starting from an industry-leading position of strength. In fact, in 2022, ComEd was recognized with the Outstanding System Resiliency Award for U.S. utilities by PA Consulting while also maintaining an average bill that is lower than those in 47 of the 50 states. Beyond the rate case, ComEd and the City of Chicago announced a proposed Chicago franchise agreement and a related energy and equity agreement. Together, these agreements grant ComEd the right to continue providing electric utility services using public waste within Chicago and creates a new non-profit entity to advance energy and energy equity-related projects. These agreements build upon the century-long partnership we have had with the city and demonstrates our alignment around key energy and sustainability goals.Pending approval by the city and Exelon Board, ComEd continues to operate in the city under the prior franchise agreement. And later this month, BGE will be filing its second multiyear plan for its electric and gas businesses with Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland following later in the first half of the year. Like Illinois, Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act has set aggressive climate and decarbonization targets, creating an environment where utility action and investment is a key priority and for which multiyear planned frameworks are particularly well suited. Jeanne will cover the rate cases and other regulatory activity in more detail shortly. As to our projected outlook, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window.We are reaffirming our 2021 to 2025 target of 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth with the expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate. We are also initiating an identical target for 2022 through 2026 where we expect to deliver 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth over the four-year horizon with the same expectation that we will reach midpoint or better of that compounded annual growth rate by 2026. This is driven by the almost 8% rate base growth from 2022 through 2026, underpinned by deploying $31 billion of capital over 2023 to 2026. That's over $2 billion more than the prior four-year period. As we balance the required progress on the energy transition with customer affordability, we continue to challenge ourselves to deliver maximum customer value at the lowest cost possible.We continue to expect some variability in our growth rates from year-to-year, due to our regulatory calendar, but we have maintained the transparency provided in the third quarter around our path to achieving our CAGR commitment. For 2023, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.30 to $2.42 per share, with the midpoint that implies 5% growth off the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. Being slightly below the annualized earnings growth range is in line with the direction we provided on our third quarter call, but we do expect 2023 to be the exception. All other years are expected to grow within the range of 6% to 8%, if not above it. We remain confident in the earnings power of our business. We expect an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in 2023, reflecting approximately 7% growth off of our $1.35 dividend per share in 2022.Jeanne will cover more of the specifics of our financial outlook. Moving to Slide 6, I want to spend a moment recognizing last year's accomplishments. Demonstrating the type of stable, predictable performance that our customers and shareholders expect us to deliver. First, we completed the separation from Constellation, which by any measure was a success and execute it in less than a year after our Board's decision to proceed. We did not miss a beat operationally, despite this separation. We invested more capital for the benefit of our customers than ever, while achieving the highest ROE since 2019. We were able to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce in a difficult labor market, a testament to our culture of engaged and purpose-driven employees.And we didn't lose sight of the importance of supporting our communities through more than just the investments we're making in them. Our employees volunteered more than 126,000 hours and connected our customers to almost $600 million of energy assistance, an increase of over $100 million from 2021. We continued to build upon our history of workforce development, launching the Atlantic City Infrastructure Academy in the fall and graduating our first group of 26 students this month with the skills needed to succeed in careers in the energy industry. We achieved our highest percentage spend ever, 39% or $2.8 billion of total spend with diverse suppliers. We gave $22 million to support schools and students in our markets. These programs include learning energy basics in middle schools and our Exelon Foundation STEM Academy that inspires high school girls to pursue careers in the energy field.And we are doing our part to create a cleaner and brighter future for our customers, making good progress on our path to clean with 112 miles of gas pipe main replacement and 12% of our vehicle fleet now electrified. These are just a few examples of the type of work we do that has led to us being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 17 years running. Last, we delivered on our earnings commitment for the year. Ultimately, 2022 was about establishing and beginning to prove out the value proposition the new Exelon offers and our team executed well. Before I turn it over to Jeanne, I will review our operating performance for 2022 on Slide 7, which ended as strongly as it began. I'll start with reliability. We were top decile in outage frequency performance at three of our four utilities, and we were top quartile for outage duration across all utilities.Achieving performance like this requires sustained focus and effort across our business. First and foremost, it requires our team showing up 24/7, no matter the time or the conditions. For instance, Winter Storm Elliott struck our BGE service territory on December 23, taking out power to 112,000 customers. Our dedicated teams completed over 1,500 repair jobs in sub-zero temperatures and at times to bring just one or two customers back online to restore power completely without any injuries. And it wasn't just our BGE team. The power of the platform showed up in force with ComEd, PECO, and PHI supporting the restoration efforts. On behalf of the entire leadership team, we want to thank all of our employees on the front lines of storm duty for their dedication.We will not have this track record of excellence without their commitment. Operational excellence also requires smart and prudent investment that's compensated fairly, built around alignment with our jurisdictions on shared goals and priorities. Last year, we invested $7.2 billion of capital, earning that 9.4% ROE I mentioned. The ability to execute on this level of investment with the confidence that we're aligned with our jurisdictions is a key element of our success. We need to perform every day to maintain that trust. On safety, ComEd continues to maintain top quartile performance while we work to get our other three utilities up to our standards. Our efforts to reduce serious injuries have been successful, but we are also focused on implementing safety best practices at our utilities to avoid other incidents that have driven OSHA under performance in 2022.For the year, BGE, ComEd and PECO sustained top quartile customer satisfaction performance. This reflects our continued investment in technology to create a better customer experience, our top quartile reliability and our commitment to an affordable energy transition. And finally, gas odor response continues to be in the top decile across all three utilities, including with BGE completing the year with its best on record performance. We continue to accelerate the modernization and safety enhancements of the gas system while working with our customers and communities to live and work safely with gas. I will now ask Jeanne to review our financial update. Jeanne?Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by sharing my own excitement about closing out our first year as the new Exelon. As proud as I am of what we accomplished in 2022, I'm even more excited about our future. Our utilities serve the homes of more than 10 million customers, customers that include our employees, our families, hospitals, schools, and businesses..: As I cover today's updates, 2022 results, upcoming rate case activity and the roll forward of our financial disclosures, you will find that our focus on execution drives the results that customers and shareholders expect. Starting on Slide 8, we delivered strong financial results in our first year as a new company. For the fourth quarter, Exelon's continuing operations earned $0.43 per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For the full year 2022, we earned $2.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.27 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Results that are in the upper half of our narrowed guidance range and represent 8.1% growth of the $2.10 per share mid-point of our Analyst Day guidance range for 2021. Throughout the year, we benefited from rising treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE as well as favorable weather and storm conditions.Solar Energy, Panels, TechnologyPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashThese benefits, along with strong cost control in our core operations, helped to offset higher interest expense at corporate and the businesses, along with the one-time items of discontinued operations and the voluntary customer refund in Illinois. That net favorability provided flexibility to reinvest back in the business and de-risk future years while ensuring we were meeting and exceeding our financial commitments. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix slides 32 and 33. Moving to Slide 9. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we delivered within our 9% to 10% targeted range, with a 9.4% ROE for 2022. This is the highest our earned ROE has been since 2019 as we focused on mitigating inflationary pressures to ensure costs aligned with our allowed revenue.30-year treasury rates improved as well, supporting ComEd's distribution ROE. Looking forward, we remain focused on earning the allowed returns of the utilities, which we expect will keep Exelon in the 9% to 10% earned ROE range annually throughout the planning period, while investing to maintain reliability and keep pace with our jurisdictions energy transition. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.42 per share, reflecting a mid-point that is consistent with the directional guide provided in the third quarter. Relative to the midpoint of our 2022 estimated guidance range, the 5% year-over-year earnings growth is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as by increased revenues associated with completed rate cases.As a reminder, expected year-over-year growth in 2023 is slightly below the 6% to 8% range as PECO enters the second year with its current electric distribution rates and anticipates returning to normal weather and storm activity. 2023 also requires managing against cost increases in our multi-year plans out East as we await their first reconciliations, particularly at BGE and the end of the stay-out provision at Pepco DC. With the de-risking efforts we undertook in 2022, including initiating hedging programs for both our long and short-term debt as well as for Exelon's exposure to the 30-year treasury, we are confident that our projected earnings will be within the range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share in 2023. Additional detail on our earnings sensitivities reflective of our hedging activity to date is provided on Slide 34 in the appendix.As you think about the shaping of 2023 quarterly earnings, I will remind you that, historically, we have realized approximately 28% of full year earnings in the first quarter, consistent with seasonal weather patterns at the utilities and the general cadence of completed rate cases. On Slide 11, we provide our updated outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2023 to 2026. We plan to invest $7.2 billion in 2023 and a total of $31.3 billion over the next four years, an increase of $2.3 billion from the prior four-year planning period. Since the Analyst Day disclosures for the 2023 through 2025 period, we have identified an additional $875 million of planned investments to serve our customers. Updates include refinements to ComEd's distributional capital plan, which was developed as part of the multi-year integrated grid plans filed this January.The result is that over the next four years, our rate base is expected to increase 7.9% on a compound annual growth basis to $69.6 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.3 billion to rate base from 2023 through 2026, an amount roughly equal to the size of ComEd's current rate base. With four multi-year plan rate filings planned for this year, I'd remind you that our capital forecast only reflects identified projects we expect to recover through our constructive recovery mechanisms. The plan reflects a disciplined prioritization of potential investments to balance interest, providing reliable service to our customers and progress on our jurisdictions energy goals while also maintaining affordability. Our plan remains free of any large speculative projects.In fact, the largest transmission and distribution project in our plan remains the $300 million multi-year Erdman to Summerfield Transmission Expansion project at BGE. This project represents only 1% of our total projected capital spend from 2023 to 2026. And the collective spend on the largest transmission and distribution projects at each of the four operating companies totals only 2.2% of our $31 billion plan. Turning to Slide 12, our ability to deploy $31 billion of capital for our customers over the next four years at affordable rates amidst persistent inflationary pressures would not be possible without a resolute focus on managing costs. At our adjusted O&amp;M costs grown in line with average annual inflation of 3.2% from 2016 through 2023, they would've increased by approximately $1 billion.Instead, we are projecting a 1.7% CAGR for the same period, eliminating over $500 million of customer rate increases that would've occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. This includes leveraging our platform of four operating companies to share best practices and drive economies of scale. It also includes investing in innovative technology and processes such as a recent pilot to conduct vegetation management work with the help of specialized drones, reducing a two-day job for a human crew to 45 minutes of drone deployment. It also cut the material acquired by over 90%. We are particularly proud of keeping O&amp;M growth low after the separation. We committed to our customers that they would not see increased costs because of the separation, and I'm proud to say we achieved that.From renegotiating key enterprise wide IT contracts to continually reoptimizing the organizational design for the services our utilities need. Our cost discipline culture ensured that we kept that commitment while executing operationally at top-notch levels and delivering earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. In 2023, adjusted O&amp;M at our utilities is projected to be $4.2 billion, representing a 1% or $50 million increase from 2022, a rate well below the expected inflation rate of 4% in 2023 and building on our efficiency efforts in 2022. We will continue to ensure that our business is appropriately designed to efficiently deliver services as a transmission and distribution only energy delivery company. This study discipline around cost has positioned us very well.In the bottom chart, you can see Exelon's average electric rates are 23% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. Beyond cost management, other unique factors contribute to lower bills for our customers, some of which Calvin discussed. But I'd like to highlight the benefit of the carbon mitigation contracts resulting from Illinois's 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act or CEJA. Based on energy forwards as of January 31, these credits are projected to protect ComEd customers from over $3 billion of additional energy charges between 2022 and 2027. That brings me to Slide 13, where I wanted to take a moment to highlight ComEd's commitment to decarbonizing the communities in Illinois in the most efficient, affordable, and equitable manner possible.CEJA put Illinois on a path to a 100% decarbonized energy sector by 2045. It also provides a framework for ComEd to help support the state and make the grid investments necessary to support beneficial electrification, decarbonization, and the energy transformation. In one of its first steps to meeting the challenge of a clean energy economy, ComEd filed its multi-year integrated grid plan and multi-year rate plan covering 2024 through 2027 with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The proposed investment plan includes initiatives such as 4 kV to 12 kVconversions, bus reconfigurations, overhead and underground repairs and support for an anticipated 1 million electric vehicles by 2030. To smooth the transition for customers from the formula rate to the multi-year rate plan, ComEd has filed to defer collection of 35% of the 2024 increase until 2026.An order is expected from the ICC no later than December 20, 2023. Turning to Slide 14, as Calvin mentioned, BGE anticipates filing its second multi-year plan and first multi-year plan reconciliation with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month. Proposed investments expected in the filing support the climate and decarbonization goals of Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act. As an example of how we are partnering with key stakeholders in Maryland consider the electric school bus program. The new law created a statewide electric school bus program through which BGE will be able to offer $50 million in incentives to school districts we serve to help cover the incremental cost of purchasing electric buses with a focus on access for low income and minority communities, plus BGE will also be able to call on those new electric fleets to provide grid resilient support through vehicle-to-grid technology.Those types of initiatives are what drive the local economic impact highlighted on the slide, including the support of over 72,000 jobs. BGE's rate plan will cover electric and gas customer rates from 2024 through 2026 inclusive of a reconciliation on 2021 and 2022 cost from its original multi-year plan filing. Additional details will be available once BGE makes its filing later this month, with a final order expected by December 2023. With Delmarva Power Delaware's ongoing electric distribution rate case, and Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland's anticipated second multi-year plan filings, you can expect further discussion on these cases on future earnings calls. Turning to Slide 15, with $31 billion of projected capital spend, driving 7.9% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%, we are projecting compounded annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2026 from our 2022 guidance midpoint of $2.25 per share.Maintaining our commitment to transparency from the third quarter earnings call, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2026 on Slide 16. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the four-year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our commitment of 6% to 8% through 2026. As you can see on the slide after 2023, we expect to deliver each year within the 6% to 8% range, if not above. We have reaffirmed our guidance for 2021 through 2025 of 6% to 8% with the expectation of being at midpoint or better. Similarly, we expect our four year CAGR from 2022 to 2026 will be at the midpoint or better of the 6% to 8% targeted growth range. We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend pay-out ratio of operating earnings with a dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings.We anticipate an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share in 2023, which is 6.7% higher than the 2022 dividend. I will conclude with a discussion on our balance sheet on Slide 17. The attributes of our fully regulated transmission and distribution platform, including forward-looking recovery mechanisms, majority decoupled rates, de-concentrated investment risk and diversified jurisdictions will continue to provide flexibility going forward. Over our guidance period, we project 100 basis points to 200 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. While the U.S. Treasury Department works towards implementing the Inflation Reduction Act legislation, our plan fully incorporates the impact of the corporate alternative minimum tax, including reflecting the results in deferred tax assets in each of the utilities rate bases, consistent with the recent rate case filings at ComEd and Delmarva Power.We have talked previously about how regulations and the inclusion of certain deductions would substantially mitigate the corporate alternative minimum tax impact. Without the ability to include certain deductions, we expect the cushion in our average credit metrics to be on the lower end of the 100 basis points to 200 basis points range. Our metrics would average closer to the higher end of the range over the guidance period if we were able to include those deductions. Consistent with our earnings profile, our credit metrics are expected to strengthen over time as we step into new multiyear plans and finalize the reconciliation processes. As we await clarity on the corporate alternative minimum tax, we continue to maintain the discipline approach to cost and cash management across all areas of the business, ensuring we maintain appropriate cushion above our downgrade threshold of 12%.I will close by reaffirming our financing plans with the holding company. We continue to affirm the remaining $425 million of our $1 billion equity commitment. We expect to issue this equity sometime between 2023 and 2025. As we work with our jurisdictions and find opportunities for further investment at the utilities, we'll continue to ensure that our capital structure reflects a balanced funding strategy and a strong balance sheet consistent with the expectations of a premium, transmission and distribution company. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. Before turning it over for questions, I will end with the focus of what's ahead for 2023. Operations and safety continue to be foundational. Maintaining reliability for our customers, while operating safely is non-negotiable. We'll deploy $7.2 billion of capital, ensuring we make the necessary progress to meet the reliability and technology needs of tomorrow's grid. Indeed, as many of you saw last week, the FBI announced it had interrupted a plot to damage Maryland's power grid. The need to enhance the physical and cybersecurity of the grid has never been greater. The industry has made it a priority. The partnership between the industry and the government is key to our defences and on behalf of our employees and our customers we greatly appreciate the vigilance and dedication by the FBI and U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland in protecting our nation's critical infrastructure.Thank you. Despite the urgency, investing capital efficiently will ensure we are making returns on our investments in line with those allowed by our jurisdictions, earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range. As a result, we expect to deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023, maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet and execute on a number of rate cases this year to sustain operational and financial performance in the future. As we deliver on this plan, we will continue to focus on the value we are providing our customers. This includes not only continuing to advocate for policies that keep the customers as top priority, but also continuing to evaluate our own business to find efficiencies as a more focused transmission and distribution only utility.Like 2022, we have a lot we want to accomplish in 2023. But we again, expect to be successful because that's what we do. And we know that's what you expect from the premier, transmission and distribution company one that's deploying $31 billion of capital for our customers with rate-based growth and ROEs resulting in 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth and a total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. As always, thank you for your time and support. And we'll now take your questions.See also 15 Most Valuable Shipping Companies in the World and 15 Countries that Make the Best Beer in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The annual event engages and educates policymakers about the need to fund the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) at the highest level possible in order the meet the needs of low-income households and the most vulnerable, including seniors, those with disabilities and children. The event was organized by the National Energy &amp; Utility Affordability Coalition (NEUAC).""Energy affordability is a real concern for many of our customers, especially those who live below the poverty line. For them, LIHEAP is a lifeline that protects them from dangerous cold or heat and keeps electricity and gas flowing to their homes,"" said Calvin Butler, president and CEO of Exelon. ""Exelon teams were able to help connect more than a million eligible customers to more than $1 billion in energy assistance over the past two years, including LIHEAP funds. They also work continuously to share energy saving practices and other important bill management programs with customers to help them control energy costs. Helping to keep energy costs as affordable as possible is just one more way Exelon is powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers.""In 2022 alone, Exelon helped connect nearly 470,000 eligible customers to $589.2 million in energy assistance, of which $379.13 million, or 64 percent of the funds, were from LIHEAP. Below are the energy assistance totals by Exelon company and the corresponding LIHEAP amounts and percentages:ACE: $88.3 million ($51.4 million/58.3 percent)BGE: $116 million ($46.7 million/40.2 percent)ComEd: $128.9 million ($96 million/74.4 percent)Delmarva Power: $49 million ($39.6 million/80.7 percent)PECO: $159 million ($45.7 million/28.7 percent)Pepco: $48 million ($33.8 million/70.5 percent)Story continuesSince the start of the pandemic, Exelon has continually looked for ways to robustly fund energy assistance and support state and local agencies, collaborating on effective delivery of available resources. The company recognizes sustained access to a financial backstop—and an innovative approach to getting the word out about energy assistance—helps customers prevent disconnection of service, helps families maintain safe and stable housing and restores dignity by helping customers pay bills in full and on time. Some of those efforts include:BGE and Pepco advocated for policy changes to benefit low-to-moderate income customers and helped get those additional relief funds to Maryland customers.ComEd’s Community Energy Assistance Ambassador program provided jobs for local residents, who helped connect thousands of customers to available bill-assistance programs.ComEd expanded its bill-assistance programs to include the Your Neighbor Fund, partially funded by 62,000 ComEd employees, which provided grants of up to $180 to customers facing financial hardship.PECO helped organize virtual utility fairs, where customers participated in one-on-one, confidential conversations to learn about bill-assistance programs for multiple utilities, including water, natural gas and electric, and then received assistance to start the application process.Pepco, PECO, Delmarva Power and Atlantic City Electric partnered with trusted community organizations, local government and hospitals during the pandemic and beyond to spread the word about customer assistance programs, successfully reaching tens of thousands of customers in need.And all six Exelon utilities made it even easier to sign up for assistance funds and have those funds applied to customer accounts.More information about National LIHEAP Action Day 2022 is available at neuac.org.About ExelonExelon (Nasdaq: EXC) is a Fortune 200 company and the nation’s largest energy delivery company, serving more than 10 million customers through six fully regulated transmission and distribution utilities — Atlantic City Electric (ACE), Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), Delmarva Power &amp; Light (DPL), PECO Energy Company (PECO), and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco).

222,dce09afa-3a43-31cf-a9c5-a02f737f71f5,JNPR,2023-02-18,J.P. Morgan Analysts Say These 3 Stocks Are Their Top Picks for 2023,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-p-morgan-analysts-3-163214340.html,1676651534,STORY,"['TMUS', 'ZTS', 'JNPR']","[Anyone involved in the investing game will know it’s all about “stock picking.” Choosing the right stock to put your money behind is vital to ensure strong returns on an investment. Therefore, when the Wall Street pros consider a name to be a “Top Pick,” investors should take note.Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve looked up the details on three stocks that have recently gotten ‘Top Pick’ designation from the analysts at banking giant J.P. Morgan.So, let’s dive into the details and find out what makes them so. Using a combination of market data, company reports, and analyst commentary, we can get an idea of just what makes these stocks compelling picks for 2023.Zoetis Inc. (ZTS)The first JPM pick we're looking at is a biopharmaceutical company – but with a twist. Zoetis is specializing in medicines and vaccines for veterinary purposes. We don’t often think about that, just assuming that human and veterinary drugs have a lot of overlap, but there are significant differences in active and inactive ingredients, dosages, and even delivery mechanisms. Veterinary medicine can overlap with human treatments, but it does not always, and many of its treatments and drugs are species-specific. This is the world in which Zoetis works.Veterinary care, for pets and livestock, is a huge business, with impacts on some of the most personal aspects of our lives, from the animals we take into our home to our very food supply. Zoetis regularly brings in close to $2 billion per quarter in revenues; the last quarter reported, 4Q22, showed $2 billion in revenue, and adjusted net income of $539 million, or adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15. Looking ahead, the company is projecting 2023 revenue between of $8.575 - $8.725 billion, above Street estimate of $8.55 billion.At the same time, Zoetis has kept up its small, but highly reliable dividend payment. The payment, of $0.375 cents per common share, annualizes to $1.5 and gives a yield of 1%. The company has been keeping up reliable payments for over a decade now.Story continuesAgainst this backdrop, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott lays out a reasoned explanation for keeping Zoetis as a Top Pick: “We see ZTS as well-positioned with an innovative and differentiated portfolio (derm, parasiticides, pain &amp; diagnostics) that should translate to further upside to numbers over time. And while the company had supply issues in 2022, these appear to have been largely addressed with little to no impact expected on 2023 results... We see a very attractive setup for the stock in 2023.”Seeing a sound current position, and room for future expansion, Schott rates this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets his price target at $225 to indicate his belief in a 31% one-year upside to the shares. (To watch Schott’s track record, click here)Overall, this veterinary medical firm gets a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 4 recent reviews that include 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The stock is selling for $171.64, and its $202.50 average price target implies an 18% gain by the end of this year. (See ZTS stock forecast)Juniper Networks (JNPR)We’ll now switch gears and move over to the tech sector, where Juniper Networks is specializing in the development and marketing of routers, switches, network management software, security products, and software-defined networking tech – in short, all of things that are needed to put together and maintain networking and cybersecurity solutions.Networking has become an essential business in our digital world, and Juniper has realized consistently high revenues and earnings from it. In 2022, the company has reported $5.3 billion in total revenues, up from $4.73 billion in the prior year, for a year-over-year gain of 12%.Preliminary 4Q data showed an 11% y/y gain for revenues, to $1.448 billion. The GAAP net income came to $180 million, or 55 cents per share, up 36% y/y, and by non-GAAP measures, the income of $213 million (65 cents per diluted share) was up 16% y/y. The company has deep pockets, although cash reserves are down from 2021; Juniper finished 2022 with $1.23 billion in cash and liquid assets, compared to $1.69 billion at the end of 2021. Looking ahead, Juniper guided toward a 15% y/y revenue gain for 1Q23, to approximately $1.34 billion.Of note for return-minded investors, Juniper authorized an increase of 5% for its common share dividend, starting with the March 22 payment. This brings the dividend to 22 cents per common share, or 88 cents annualized, for a 2.77% yield.Covering Juniper for JPMorgan, 5-star analyst Samik Chatterjee writes, “We see the recent earnings print further underscoring our rationale for Juniper being our Top Pick for 2023, led by the company's resilient revenue/ earnings, which we believe is supported by a large share gain opportunity in Enterprise, a robust backlog, and customer vertical diversification.”Chatterjee backs that 'share gain opportunity' with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and a $42 price target, which implies a one-year upside of ~33%. (To watch Chatterjee’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 11 analyst reviews on Juniper in recent weeks, and they break down to 5 Buys, 4 Holds, and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $31.65 and the $36.09 average target indicates room for ~14% over the next 12 months. (See Juniper stock forecast)T-Mobile US (TMUS)Last up is a company that likely doesn’t need much introduction. T-Mobile is one of the US’ largest wireless service providers, and one of the leaders in expanding 5G network coverage across the country. T-Mobile’s 5G network covers more than 325 million people in North America, mostly in the US. The company boasts nearly 2.65 million customers for high-speed internet as of Q4 2022, up 25% from Q3 – and up from just 646,000 at the end of 2021.T-Mobile reported solid gains in subscriber numbers in its 4Q22 report, adding 1.8 million postpaid net customers and 927K postpaid phone customers in the quarter. High-speed internet net customer additions came to 524,000. Overall, the company generated Q4 revenue of $20.27 billion, a 2.5% year-over-year decrease, and $390 million below consensus estimate. However, GAAP EPS jumped 247% y/y to $1.18, beating Street estimate of $1.07.Cash generation was also eye-catching. T-Mobile saw its annual free cash flow jump more than 35% y/y, from $5.65 billion in 2021 to $7.66 billion in 2022. The FCF gain was driven by a massive spike in Q4; the $2.18 billion in FCF from 4Q22 was up more than 96% y/y.These are solid numbers, according to JPMorgan analyst Phillip Cusick, who writes: “T-Mobile is our top pick for 2023 across our coverage as we see substantial synergy and operating efficiencies over the next several years driving strong EBITDA and cash flow growth.”The company’s cash flow growth potential back up Cusick’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, and his $200 price target suggests a 35% upside over the coming year. (To watch Cusick’s track record, click here)All in all, Wall Street generally was impressed by T-Mobile’s performance, and that shows in the analyst reviews. Of the 16 on file, 14 are to Buy against just 2 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s $179.92 average price target implies ~22% upside from the $147.87 trading price.

224,ad86394d-f286-3386-80f0-febe2b5883b1,PRU,2023-02-18,"Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 59%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-120030179.html,1676721630,STORY,['PRU'],"[Every investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Prudential Financial, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Prudential Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Prudential Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 4.8% of the stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Prudential Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$48m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

225,730f4a60-d36f-33b8-9de6-4f756ddb06c6,DVN,2023-02-18,Earnings Update: Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) Just Reported And Analysts Are Trimming Their Forecasts,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-devon-energy-corporation-nyse-121340088.html,1676722420,STORY,['DVN'],"[It's been a sad week for Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), who've watched their investment drop 16% to US$53.33 in the week since the company reported its annual result. Revenues came in 2.9% below expectations, at US$19b. Statutory earnings per share were relatively better off, with a per-share profit of US$9.12 being roughly in line with analyst estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the 17 analysts covering Devon Energy, is for revenues of US$16.6b in 2023, which would reflect an uncomfortable 12% reduction in Devon Energy's sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to descend 15% to US$7.74 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$18.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.44 in 2023. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a small dip in earnings per share estimates.The analysts made no major changes to their price target of US$73.58, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Devon Energy's valuation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Devon Energy analyst has a price target of US$96.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$45.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.Story continuesThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Devon Energy's past performance and to peers in the same industry. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 12% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 20% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 5.7% annually for the foreseeable future. The forecasts do look bearish for Devon Energy, since they're expecting it to shrink faster than the industry.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Unfortunately they also cut their revenue estimates for next year, and forecasts imply the business' revenues are expected to perform worse than the wider industry. That said, earnings per share are more important for creating value for shareholders. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Devon Energy going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.Before you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for Devon Energy (1 can't be ignored!) that we have uncovered.Have feedback on this article?

XLE ended 2022 up 57% compared to the S&amp;P's (^GSPC) 19% decline.One example of energy sector stock woes: on Wednesday, Devon Energy’s (DVN) stock dragged down its peers after the shale producer warned of increased costs. The company's capital spending is expected to produce about 1.5% less oil than what Wall Street had anticipated.To be sure, energy stocks started the year at a very high level. Shares of ExxonMobil (XOM), for example, which saw record profits last year, hit a 52-week high in early February. Still, the oil and gas giant was recently downgraded to Hold from Buy at CFRA research given its run-up over the last year.""Our change in opinion is based on valuation. Shares are up 42% in the last 12 months,"" analyst Stewart Glickman said in a note to investors.""In the near term, we think refining margins could narrow as price caps on Russian refined products work their way into the system in February, and we think oil services cost pressures may intensify.""The energy sector's performance is often tied to its underlying commodity price, which in this case has been stagnant lately. Brent crude (BZ=F) has traded as low as $77 this year, but mostly within a range of $82-85 as an EU ban on Russian oil products went into effect Feb. 5.Story continuesWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude prices were hovering as high as $81 per barrel on Jan. 23, and in recent weeks have been under pressure because of building inventories. On Thursday, WTI was trading closer to $78 per barrel.The good news? It's expected oil prices will rise from here, as seasonal demand increases in the spring, giving a boost to energy stocks. The impact of China's full reopening post Covid lockdowns is also expected to fuel oil demand.A staff member refuels a car at a gas station in Haizhou District of Lianyungang, east China's Jiangsu Province, Jan. 17, 2023. (Photo by Geng Yuhe/Xinhua via Getty Images)China is the main thesis for bullish views on crude oil prices, though the economy's reopening is not linear and its impact on the oil market may not be as fast as analyst had expected, according to Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth.""That doesn't mean it's not coming [price impact on oil], and I think that it is. But the magnitude and the timing of it is what keeps the market on its toes and trading with a lot of volatility,"" Babin recently told Yahoo Finance Live.For now, energy bulls still lean towards cyclical equities over high tech growth names, even if that isn't part of the recent 2023 trend.""I overwhelmingly prefer energy stocks over technology stocks,"" Louis Navellier of Navellier Calculated Investing recently told Yahoo Finance, ""Energy has much stronger forecasted revenue and earnings, plus continues to trade well below the PE ratio for the S&amp;P 500.""Ines is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The first dividend will be paid on Mar 31, 2023, to its shareholders of record as of Mar 15.This initiative is reflective of its focus on a balanced capital allocation strategy via balance sheet strength and operational excellence. The announcement also reflects this U.S.-based, fifth-largest homebuilder’s confidence in its future performance and ability to drive shareholder value.Phillippe Lord, chief executive officer of MTH, stated, “We believe we are well-positioned to return capital to shareholders and attract a broader investor base without limiting our growth opportunities, given our sustainable free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet.”Strong Liquidity Position to Boost Investors ValueIn this challenging housing market and uncertain macroeconomic environment, when many companies are backing off from dividend hikes and repurchases, Meritage Homes has ample liquidity and a healthy balance sheet to cheer its stockholders.At the end of 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled $861.6 million compared with $618.3 million on Dec 31, 2021.

The metrics also rose 13% and 33%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s levels, thanks to higher volumes and pricing.

230,6cceec25-a800-34eb-98fa-52cafe6ba9b7,ORCL,2023-02-18,The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy for February 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-ai-stocks-buy-135526643.html,1676382926,STORY,"['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AI', 'IBM', 'ORCL']","[AI stocks have recently seen a surge in popularity as this technology continues to develop and becomes increasingly relevant. Companies that develop AI technologies or use AI to improve their products and services have become attractive investment opportunities for investors who want to tap into the growth potential this sector offers. And many tech giants, including Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have integrated AI into their products and services, from voice-activated personal assistants to self-driving cars.In addition to the tech sector, the healthcare industry is also adopting AI. AI is increasingly being used to diagnose diseases and develop treatments, providing new investment opportunities in this growing field.Investing in AI stocks can be a high-risk, high-reward proposition as the technology is still evolving, and the market can be volatile. That said, while investors seeking less risk can choose to invest in AI ETFs, these three AI stocks are among the best options for long-term investors right now, in my view.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAIC3.ai$21.14ORCLOracle$89.42IBMInternational Business Machines$137.35C3.ai (AI) mark stockSource: ShutterstockC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is a leading artificial intelligence software company that provides enterprise AI solutions to various industries. The company’s AI platform is designed to help organizations harness the power of AI to improve operational efficiency and make data-driven decisions. Arguably, C3.ai is the best pure-play AI stock currently available to investors.In any case, the company’s shares are clearly very volatile. C3.ai went public in December 2020, but like many high-growth stocks, AI stock has been hit hard. Despite this move, the company has received significant recognition, previously named a leader in Gartner’s (NYSE:IT) Magic Quadrant for IoT Platforms.Story continuesFrom a fundamental standpoint, C3.ai looks like a young, emerging company. Revenues reached $62.4 million in the most recent quarter, representing a 7% increase. However, the company also posted a $68.5 million net loss. That’s not conducive to many investors’ ideas of how profitable such companies should be.That said, perhaps the most encouraging aspect of this company is its subscription growth rate, at 26% year-over-year. This impressive growth suggests that C3.ai’s enterprise partners are finding utility in its products and services.Oracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is another large technology stock investing in AI to enhance its products and services. The firm offers a range of AI solutions for various industries, including finance, healthcare, and retail. Oracle’s AI platform, Oracle Cloud AI, provides businesses with tools for data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning.Oracle has also developed a suite of AI-powered applications. Oracle’s AI efforts, like many other firms, are aimed at helping businesses harness the power of AI to make data-driven decisions and improve their operations.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Services is a group of services with machine learning models prebuilt into them. Developers then apply these prebuilt AI services to applications and business operations. The result is increased efficiency.OCI has utility as a digital assistant that can help complete tasks through natural language, language, speech, vision, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Given the high level of interest around this technology, it’s clear Oracle could be an overlooked player in this space.International Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another big technology company with a strong focus on AI. The company has invested in AI for a long time, with solutions across various industries. IBM’s AI platform, Watson, is a cloud-based system that uses machine learning and natural language processing.IBM also offers a suite of AI-powered applications, such as chatbots, that can automate tasks and improve customer engagement. In general, IBM’s AI efforts aim to help businesses harness the power of AI to improve their operations, make data-driven decisions, and drive innovation.IBM’s Institute for Business Value undertook a deep dive into 35 Ai implementations globally to understand AI’s value to enterprises. The results suggested that one-quarter of large companies would have moved beyond AI pilots and into operational AI by the end of 2022. Other sources indicated that only 23% of all businesses had incorporated AI into their product and service offerings to date.With its deep knowledge of the AI space, IBM will continue to serve as a consultant to other businesses. But it is also leveraging its AI platform to sell to those enterprises, and AI could be one of the things that make IBM relevant again, after a long period in the tech background.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC.The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language. Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to Stephanie.Stephanie Ferris: Thank you, George and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today marks my first earnings call as the CEO of FIS. Let me begin by saying I feel incredibly privileged by the opportunity to reflect on our past, restart our future and recommit to our clients, colleagues and investors. FIS is a tremendous company with world-class assets and a marquee set of clients. We are an industry leader with more than five decades of history, positioning where change, challenge and opportunity intersect. Today, I will present to you the next chapter. We have a lot of ground to cover, including our fourth quarter financial results, 2023 guidance and specific outcomes of our strategic review which includes the planned spin-off of our merchant business Worldpay.Story continuesLet me start by sharing that I am pleased to report that we met our financial goals for the fourth quarter. While this is a good first step, we recognize that we have a lot of work to do to meet our expectations going forward. Today, we will share a number of decisive actions we are taking to better align our business with the needs of our clients and the expectations of our shareholders. Let me take you through our path forward. Turning to Slide 5, we have set a new agenda to improve the operational performance of the business, sharpen our client focus, and improve both the free cash flow of the company as well as the earnings quality. We will do this by following three key principles that will underpin all of our go-forward actions to drive value.First, we will ensure that clients are at the center of everything we do by creating a client-centric culture. Second, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio of solutions to ensure growth for our clients. And third, we will simplify and streamline our operations, decision-making and time to market to improve profitability. Combined, these principles form the foundation of our efforts to drive efficiency, effectiveness and profitable growth. Turning to Slide 6. Over the past 60 days, we have moved with the highest sense of urgency and focus to advance a number of strategically important initiatives. First, in December, we announced that we initiated with the Board of Directors a comprehensive assessment of the company's strategy, operations and structure with the goal of positioning FIS to drive stronger results, increase shareholder value and enhance client experience.As an outcome of this ongoing assessment, we announced today we are pursuing a spin-off of our merchant business, creating two world-class public companies, FIS and Worldpay. It is my pleasure to also announce that Charles Drucker, Worldpay's former CEO, has agreed to return as a strategic adviser to me. Charles, who is my close friend and colleague, will lead the preparedness phase of the planned spin-off and is expected to become Worldpay's CEO upon the closing of the transaction. Second, we announced in November that we are launching an enterprise transformation program. This program, which we have branded Future Forward, is moving ahead with speed to improve the operational performance of the company by driving efficiency, effectiveness and profitable growth across every facet of the enterprise.When we launched Future Forward, we are targeting to deliver cash savings across the company of $500 million by year end 2024. I am happy to share that we now expect to exceed our $500 million original target by the end of this year and I am increasing our target to $1.25 billion in net savings prior to the effect of the spin-off exiting 2024. As I mentioned earlier, we are and will continue to be intensely focused on cost management, cash generation and earnings quality. Third, we are realigning our incentive programs to be tied to shareholder value creation, company performance and client satisfaction scores. In order for us to deliver on our commitments, this realignment is critical. And fourth, consistent with our December announcement, we have continued to reshape our Board of Directors for independent governance.I am proud of what we have been able to do in the first 60 days. This is just the beginning for us. Slide 7 describes our rationale for separating the two businesses. The pace of disruption in payments is rapidly accelerating, requiring increased investment for growth and a different capital allocation strategy for our merchant business. The separation of Worldpay from FIS will result in the creation of two standalone market leaders, each well-positioned to capitalize on the significant value-creation opportunities ahead in their respective markets. It is expected that FIS and Worldpay will maintain a close commercial partnership to deliver critical capabilities like embedded finance and loyalty through premium payback preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and limiting potential dis-synergy.It should also simplify our operations and give each management team additional flexibility to operate the business in the way that best delivers value for all clients and shareholders alike. Specifically, it will enable FIS to pursue a strong investment-grade credit rating while enabling Worldpay to invest more aggressively in growth. A separation also enables FIS and Worldpay to implement different capital allocation strategies which align to their growth targets and underlying market needs. Turning to Slide 8. Both companies serve a blue-chip set of clients. FIS serves the technology needs of global financial institutions, regional community banks and marquee set of asset managers across the spectrum. Worldpay serves the payment needs of the world's global technology, internet and retail companies.Both companies boast unrivaled global distribution and operating scale. By separate entities, FIS remains the number one global FinTech provider and Worldpay remains the number one global acquirer by transactions. Both companies will be market leaders in their own right and by forging a commercial relationship together, we can affect a superior outcome as compared to keeping them together. Let me provide some additional context for what this transaction means for the standalone FIS business on Slide 9. FIS is returning to its roots. This focus will allow the company to maintain its competitive advantage in delivering innovative next-generation technology solutions to the most complex financial institutions. Additionally, FIS will be in a better position to balance return of capital to shareholders with organic investment and complementary M&amp;A.We remain committed to our investment grade ratings, conservative capital structure and growing dividends. Putting it altogether, we are returning FIS to its historical quality compounder model which is more closely aligned with the way that FIS operated before the Worldpay acquisition. As a quality compounder, FIS will emphasize steady recurring revenue growth, consistent margin expansion and disciplined capital return to shareholders. Importantly, we will prioritize maximizing free cash flow and profitable revenue growth. Consequently, I would expect our free cash flow conversion to move permanently higher post the spend, reflecting less working capital volatility and lower capital expenditures. Lastly, we are committed to improving the quality of our reported earnings.This includes narrowing the delta between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings and presenting free cash flow measures that better align with the cash we have available to deploy. Erik will provide additional color during his discussion of our financials. Now I will touch on the Worldpay strategy to drive enhanced shareholder value. Worldpay operates in a more dynamic and disruptive end market relative to Heritage FIS with more of a growth focus. The separation from FIS will allow Worldpay to pursue a more growth-oriented strategy, which we believe the company is better suited for and aligns more closely with investor expectations. Central to the growth strategy is a return to more consistent M&amp;A and a capital structure that does not require an investment grade rating.SoftwareBeyond an organic investment, the team is taking aggressive steps to repivot the business back towards growth. This includes the investment in the Worldpay for platform strategy to strengthen the company's value proposition with ISVs and a continued push toward increasing its total percent of e-commerce revenue. While near-term investments are impacting profitability, we are confident the business can return to growth and deliver value for shareholders as an independent entity. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to provide some additional insight into the durability of our banking and capital markets businesses. And why I am so confident that they are poised to deliver accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion. We are reorienting FIS toward a path of more sustainable, higher quality recurring revenue growth.There are two challenges specific to 2023, which are masking the underlying performance of our business, particularly in the Banking segment. The first is our previously discussed elongation in sales cycles for very large transactions. To be clear, our pipeline of opportunities remains robust and our win rate on transactions is stable. We are confident as economic conditions stabilize, sales will accelerate. We also hired a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on driving highly profitable recurring revenue growth regardless of deal size. We believe this hire will help us cross-sell and up-sell with existing clients as well as better penetrate smaller sized financial institutions. The second challenge is a growth headwind tied to non-recurring revenue, largely one-time licenses and deconversion fees from bank consolidations.We anticipate this to be another 1% headwind in 2023. We do not expect one-time license and deconversion fee revenue to remain a similar headwind in 2024. While the above trends are creating a short-term headwind for us, we believe our normalized growth rate for these segments is approximately 3% to 5%, which demonstrates the underlying strength of our banking and capital markets businesses. With a refocus on high-quality recurring revenue growth and the benefit from our future forward initiative, we are expecting margin expansion in banking and capital markets for 2023. As a result of the timing around our actions, we are confident that these businesses have hit the low point of their margin contraction and will return to margin expansion in the back half of the year.On the back of all the future forward actions we have taken are now planning to take. Tying it altogether, FIS is on a trajectory to create shareholder value as a quality compounder that generates consistent mid single-digit recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and robust free cash flow. Turning to Slide 12, we will provide you with regular updates on Future Forward. I have already described our progress toward achieving $500 million in net cash savings by the end of this year and prior to the effect of the spin-off, $1.25 billion by the end of 2024. I'd like to take a moment to describe how we will achieve these targets. Future Forward is a multifaceted initiative designed to permanently improve the performance of the company by delivering improved outcomes for clients while driving operational efficiencies internally, free cash flow generation and earnings quality.We are focused on more effectively meeting the needs of our clients by continuing to accelerate the development of next-generation technology solutions and anticipating their future needs. Driving toward a more efficient operating structure by prioritizing human and capital resources that best align with the needs of our clients and the returns expected by our shareholders. And lastly, driving improved growth outcomes through sales productivity, reduced complexity and a continued focus on clients. These important initiatives will continue at FIS and Worldpay post-spin. I will cover our next steps on Slide 13 before turning the call over to Erik for his financial review. 2023 will be a year of recommitment for FIS as we work to reposition the business to return to sustainable growth, profitability and value creation in 2024 and beyond.First, we are focused on executing the spin-off of Worldpay, which we expect to complete within the next 12 months. Second, we are sharpening our operational focus to continue to promote a client-centric culture and to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Third, Future Forward initiatives will continue within both FIS and Worldpay to maximize our cash flow and earnings quality. And finally, we are laser-focused on creating shareholder value with action and improved performance. I am pleased with the progress we have made in such a short period of time. I am confident that we are on the right path forward. And with that, I will turn it over to Erik to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2023 outlook. Erik?Erik Hoag: Thanks, Stephanie. I'd like to start today by outlining some of our priorities as a new management team before touching on our financial results. As I stated last call, a priority of ours is to be transparent about our future expectations and we delivered results in line with that revised outlook. Today, I'd like to lay out a few more priorities for 2023 and beyond. First, we will manage FIS as a high-quality compounder with predictable and consistent earnings growth. Our operational structure and long-term capital allocation strategy will prioritize delivering double-digit total shareholder return. This is the core tenet of a compounder investment thesis, which FIS is operationally and financially positioned to achieve.Next, as Stephanie mentioned, we are focused on enhancing the cash flow characteristics of FIS. In 2023, despite an anticipated reduction in EBITDA and earnings, we are taking actionable steps to increase our cash flow on a year-over-year basis. This increase in cash will be primarily driven by decreasing our capital expenditures by approximately $200 million. We are also taking conscious actions to reduce one-time spend associated with transformation and integration programs. I am confident we are taking the correct actions to deliver strong shareholder returns over the longer term. With that as the backdrop, let's quickly touch on our fourth quarter results. On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 4% organically to $3.7 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.2%, yielding an adjusted EPS of $1.71.At the segment level, banking grew 4% organically in the quarter. Banking margins were pressured due to unfavorable revenue mix and inflationary cost pressures. We had an exceptionally strong quarter in capital markets with 10% organic revenue growth and 220 basis points of margin expansion. Fourth quarter revenue growth included a 4 point benefit associated with the timing of license renewals which drove a 22% increase in non-recurring revenue. As I look to proactively message any one-off tailwinds or headwinds, this license benefit in the quarter should be flagged as a potential headwind in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding this tailwind, capital markets increased 6% organically, well ahead of historical trends. Additionally, recurring revenue grew 11%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of recurring revenue growth greater than 8%.Our strategy to transition to durable SaaS deployments continues to resonate in the market. Merchant grew 2% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, including a point of headwind associated with Russia and Ukraine. E-commerce revenue growth remained strong, increasing 16% on a constant currency basis. Our card present channel and SMB experienced softness as lower sales did not outpace attrition and compression trends. These trends in SMB reflect a lack of new product investment, which we believe the spin will best enable us to remedy. And in enterprise, we saw economic weakness in the UK and anticipate further deterioration this year. Touching quickly on cash flow and balance sheet, we generated roughly $3 billion of free cash flow in 2022, which was lower than originally expected, primarily due to negative working capital more specifically the timing of receivables within the Merchant segment.Total debt as of 12/31 was approximately $20 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and leverage was approximately 3.2x. Turning to Slide 16 for our 2023 guidance. Our philosophy remains conservative in our forward projections as we look to build credibility and deliver on our commitments. With that in mind, for the year, we anticipate consolidated organic revenue growth of negative 1% to positive 1% or $14.2 billion to $14.45 billion of revenue, adjusted EBITDA of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion or margins of 41.5% to 42.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6. This outlook assumes further macro deterioration, including a global recession impacting our Merchant segment. To be clear, our guidance assumes macroeconomic trends continue to deteriorate throughout the year.We expect total company margins to improve over the course of 2023 as we ramp the benefits associated with Future Forward. At the segment level, we expect banking organic revenue growth of 0% to 2%, which includes lapping difficult compares associated with non-recurring revenue cycles, non-recurring revenues as well as the near-term impact of elongated sales cycles. Banking margins will improve throughout the year, with a return to margin expansion in the second half. In Capital Markets, we expect 4% to 6% organic revenue growth coupled with continued margin expansion. This segment continues to benefit over our multi-year shift of sustainable SaaS deployment over license revenue. In merchant, we're anticipating organic revenue decline of 2% to 4%.This guide reflects a 300 basis point headwind associated with attrition and compression in the SMB sub-segment, and further macro deterioration impacting growth by an additional 500 basis points. We expect Worldpay to reaccelerate post spin as it leverages its scale with both organic and inorganic investments to once again differentiate itself in the market. Lastly, we're focused on our cash flow fundamentals and anticipate expanding our free cash flow conversion to over 80% in 2023. Turning to Slide 17. As Stephanie mentioned, we have two temporary headwinds impacting these segments this year and empirically believe the underlying growth rate is 3% to 5%. We're undertaking various strategic priorities for these segments, which we believe will improve our fundamentals moving forward.First, we've hired a new Chief Revenue Officer to focus on higher quality and sustainable sales growth. Specifically, while we still pursue large transactions where FIS is clearly differentiated, we want to ensure that our cross-selling to existing clients remains a priority. The breadth of solutions we have between banking and capital markets will continue to take market share as we expand our lasting relationships with our valued clients. We also see the benefits of Future Forward ramping through 2023 and 2024 to support an already expanding margin profile. Lastly, as Stephanie mentioned, we believe the spin of our Merchant segment will help simplify our operating model and focus our investments on the most pressing needs of our clients. With that, I'll turn to an overview of the merchant growth profile on Slide #18.Accounting for two known headwinds, we believe Merchant normalized growth is 4% to 6%. The first of these headwinds has been a lack of new product investment, driving compression and attrition in our SMB sub-segment, accounting for approximately 3 points of headwind in our merchant guide. We're confident this is near-term in nature and will be directly addressed with the successful spin of Worldpay as it transitions to a growth-oriented capital structure and investment philosophy. Second is the macroeconomic impact we anticipate this year. Our guidance assumes further macro deterioration in the UK and a recession in the U.S. This recessionary assumption accounts for approximately 5 points of headwind in our merchant guide. Similar to our strategic priorities in banking and capital markets, we're taking actions to accelerate off this 4% to 6% normalized growth rate.The merchant segment will benefit from new product investments to enhance its competitive profile and growth profile. Additionally, Future Forward will help support increasing profitability later in 2023 and beyond. I'll finish by noting that as revenue accelerates in the segment, it carries a very high contribution margin, which will drive underlying margin expansion beyond the Future Forward benefit. All in, we view the segment as accelerating off the 4% to 6% normalized revenue growth in 2023 with margin expansion incorporated in the model. Moving to a breakdown of EBITDA expectations on Slide #20. Both our Banking and Capital Markets businesses are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA and expand margins in 2023. In Banking, we would anticipate margin expansion of over 50 basis points and Capital Markets to expand margins by 50 to 100 basis.This significant margin expansion in Banking and Capital Markets reflects both underlying strength in the contribution margins as well as Future Forward. These segments are positioned for durable and profitable growth over the longer term, leveraging a one-to-many operating model with high concentrations of recurring revenue. Conversely, we anticipate a weaker performance in our Merchant segment, coupled with higher corporate costs. In Merchant, we anticipate a reduction in EBITDA associated with lower revenue and increased expense associated with residual payments. In our Corporate segment, we're seeing the impact from divested businesses in 2022 and a temporary headwind associated with a tough comparable on incentive compensation. Looking beyond 2023, we're confident that we're moving the company to the appropriate path of margin expansion.There are two key tenants underpinning this confidence. First, we expect to benefit from our Future Forward initiatives to continue to ramp with incremental benefit in 2024. Second, we will continue to benefit from our newly implemented sales and commission structure, which emphasizes higher margin revenue growth. Both of these initiatives will support consistent and ongoing margin expansion at FIS moving forward. Turning to Slide 21 for an overview of how Future Forward will continue to rightsize our expense base and further support profitability and cash. We expect to generate approximately $150 million of in-year operating expense reduction. These savings will ramp to approximately $600 million on a run rate basis exiting 2024. In addition to these OpEx savings, Future Forward will support our priority to improve our cash flow through a reduction in capital expenditures and one-time program spend.We're targeting a $200 million reduction in CapEx during 2023, and we intend to reduce CapEx by another $100 million in 2024. We're also aggressively ramping down spend associated with transformation and integration projects, such as platform consolidation resulting in a benefit to cash. Taking all of this into account, we're pleased to increase our expected net cash savings associated with future forward to approximately $1.25 billion exiting 2024. We will continue to provide quarterly updates on achievement of those targets throughout the life of the program. These initiatives are the bedrock for improving the operational performance of FIS and aligned directly with our priorities outlined today. I'll conclude with our current capital allocation priorities on Slide 22.In 2022  in 2023, we're focused on paying down debt, increasing our dividend and decreasing CapEx. First, we utilize excess free cash flow to reduce debt in support of our investment-grade credit ratings, which is a key pillar to FIS' long-term capital and operating strategy. Next, we recently announced an increase to our core quarterly dividend of more than 10%, and we anticipate to exit the year approximating our 35% target payout ratio. Moving forward, we intend to continue increasing our dividend roughly in line with earnings growth. As mentioned throughout my prepared remarks, Stephanie and I are also prioritizing a reduction in capital expenditures this year. We're putting a heightened focus on ROIC to ensure an appropriate return on investment and are making targeted investments aligned to client needs.Finally, in conjunction with the spin, we will conduct a comprehensive review of our capital structure to reduce future volatility in our net interest expense. We're moving with a high sense of urgency to drive these outcomes. While we face challenges, we remain confident that this is the right path forward to improve the company's performance, free cash flow and earnings. I'd like to thank everyone for their time this morning. Please note additional guidance, assumptions and next steps on the spin in our appendix.

It also fell short of the year-ago period’s $1.67.While Digital Realty experienced growth in operating revenues in the quarter, rising rental property operating expenses acted as a dampener. DLR provided a mixed outlook for 2023.Amid these, shares of Digital Realty were down more than 6.9% in after-hours trading at the NYSE.The company registered operating revenues of $1.23 billion in the fourth quarter, marking a nearly 11% year-over-year increase. Operating revenues also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. However, rental property operating expenses flared up 8.4%, while total operating expenses increased 13.5% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA of $639 million in the quarter marked a 9% increase year over year.For the full-year 2022, the core FFO per share came in at $6.70, higher than the prior-year tally of $6.53 but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.73.

The sites will support the future development of up to 84 megawatts of IT load. Moreover, DLR entered into a ground lease with an option to purchase a 4.6-acre land parcel, alongside its Dugny campus in Paris, France for a total expected investment of €34.3 million (roughly $36.6 million).  During the same period, Digital Realty closed the sale of a 25% stake in a data center facility in Frankfurt, Germany to Digital Core REIT in a transaction that valued the facility at €558 million or approximately $596 million (at 100% share), helping DLR reap net proceeds of €139.6 million or roughly $150 million.Story continuesBalance SheetDigital Realty exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $141.8 million, down from the $176.97 million recorded at the end of the third quarter of 2022.As of Dec 31, 2022, this data center REIT had $16.6 billion of total debt outstanding, of which $16.1 billion was unsecured debt and $0.5 billion was secured debt and others.

Consequently, you’ll often see many investment firms with hold ratings on particular companies. Of course, that indicates a negative view of a stock, but they don’t want to jeopardize the business relationship.It’s called sitting on the fence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor this article, I’ve selected three stocks to sell from the S&amp;P Composite 1500, where at least 10 analysts have a rating on the stock, and at least half of the ratings are “underweight” or outright “sell.”If analysts are willing to go out on a limb for a given stock, it’s often because there’s no hope of getting any business from the company. It could also be that it’s transparently obvious that the company is of poor quality.Ultimately, however, and I fall into this camp, it’s much easier to stand behind a business than tear it down.Of the three names selected, one is clearly a dud. The other two’s low standing with analysts likely has more to do with the current economic environment than anything particularly negative about each’s business.Stocks to Sell: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)HDR image, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) retailer storefront entranceSource: QualityHD / Shutterstock.comPretty much the only person who made real money on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen. He made nearly $70 million on what many have described as an elaborate “pump-and-dump” scheme. On Feb. 10, the Ontario Superior Court granted Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Canada creditor protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Without support from its struggling U.S. operations, the Canadian division has been forced to liquidate its inventory. As a result, all 54 stores will close, putting 1,400 full- and part-time employees out of work.Yet Ryan Cohen, the so-called potential savior of BBBY and Gamestop (NYSE:GME), got even wealthier than he already was.Story continuesOf the 10 analysts that cover Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, eight either have it “underweight” or “sell” with an average target price of $1.64, 20% lower than where it’s currently trading. I have no idea how there could be any holds on this sickly stock, but that’s Wall Street for you.The company recently threw a Hail Mary by selling $225 million in convertible shares. It could raise an additional $800 million down the road from the issuance of warrants. But, as Michael Burry (The Big Short) has said, it’s now in a “death spiral.”It’s hard to call BBBY anything but a big SELL!Robert Half International (RHI)The Robert Half International (RHI) logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comOf the 14 analysts that cover Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI), seven either have it “underweight” or “sell” with an average target price of $73.64. That’s about 13% lower than where it’s currently trading. Since the global human resource staffing and consulting firm reported Q4 2022 results on Jan. 26, its stock gained about 4% of its value. The company delivered $1.37 a share, one penny better than the consensus analyst estimate, while it missed the revenue estimate by $10 million.CEO Keith Waddell said: “2022 was a very successful year across the entire Robert Half enterprise. We grew full-year revenues and earnings per share — both by more than 12 percent — and achieved new record levels for each,” Robert Half’s press release stated.The analyst per-share estimate for 2023 through 2025 is $4.84, $5.62, and $6.70, respectively, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8%. The revenue estimate for 2023 is 6.0% lower and 6.6% higher in 2024, with a three-year CAGR of 1.5%.The company says it’s “optimistic” about delivering in 2023, but the analysts aren’t convinced even though its valuation by most financial metrics is currently inexpensive.For example, its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $623 million [key ratios]. Based on a market capitalization of $9.1 billion, its free cash flow yield is 6.8%. I consider anything above 8% to be in value territory.Should a recession hit in the year’s second half, you can be sure that the demand for its services will fall off a cliff, most likely resulting in a cut in earnings estimates.Stocks to Sell: Principal Financial Group (PFG)In this photo illustration Principal Financial Group (PFG) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comA total of 17 analysts cover Principal Financial Group (NYSE:PFG). Of those analysts, nine have it as an outright “sell” with an average target price of $83.43, 10% lower than where it’s currently trading. The life and health insurance and wealth management company reported Q4 2022 results at the end of January. While they beat on top- and bottom-line estimates for the entire year, operating net income and revenues were down over 2021. Except for its U.S. Insurance Solutions business, its pre-tax operating earnings were down year-over-year.Like Robert Half, Principal CEO Dan Houston believes that the company made huge strides this past year in transforming its business to one that’s delivering higher growth with less risk attached to this growth.The analysts’ EPS estimates for the next three years are $6.99, $7.72, and $8.35. Based on $6.66 a share in 2022, its CAGR is expected to be 7.8%. That’s a respectable growth rate in my opinion.In December, Seeking Alpha reported that Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kligerman downgraded PFG stock to “neutral” from “outperform” on valuation concerns. At the time, it traded at 10.6x Credit Suisse’s 2023 EPS estimate compared to 8x for its financial services peers.Except for its valuation, Kligerman like’s the company’s focus on small- to medium-sized retirement and employee benefits businesses.Up 25% over the past year, PFG could be dead money for the next couple of quarters, maybe longer.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

""The share of current debt transitioning into delinquency increased for nearly all debt types.""Not all debt is created equal. Mortgages, for instance, are backed by an asset that can appreciate over time. Often the interest rate is fixed and the timeline to repay is set. Credit cards, on the other hand, come with much higher, changeable interest rates that can end up snowballing you into greater debt.That could exacerbate the divergence between stronger consumer groups and weaker ones. As borrowers struggle to pay their bills on time and delinquency rates for credit cards and other forms of debt increase, credit scores may start to take a hit.During the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, 50 million people saw their FICO 8 scores decline by more than 20 points during the depths of the economic turmoil. And nearly 21 million had their scores decline by over 50 points.Story continuesThis slide in credit is something borrowers are hoping to avoid, especially as the economy is believed to be headed toward what Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni has called ""the most widely anticipated downturn on record.""A woman carries shopping bags during the holiday season in New York City, U.S., December 21, 2022. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozOne bright spot, however, is that increased consumer spending has been propped up by a strong labor market and higher wages.“If you look at the last jobs report, over 500,000 jobs created,"" Mastercard Economics Institute Chief US Economist Michelle Meyer told Yahoo Finance on Monday. ""Wage growth is continuing and aggregate wages are clearly still picking up, and that's supporting overall spend. So a lot of that is the consumer purchasing power that reflects the health of the labor market.”Not all transactions come from a place of strength, however.Inflation tends to be stickier for some categories more than others, meaning that core and frequent purchases on necessities may carry higher costs for a sustained period of time. And as more cash is being deployed towards ""needs,"" spending on more discretionary items tends to get put on plastic or financed.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Although the increase in swiping and tapping to pay has been welcome news for credit card companies such as American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and MasterCard (MA), it's not clear how long consumers will be able to offset elevated prices through debt before they begin pulling back on spending.According to a ScoreSense report, 53% of participants said holiday spending in 2022 ""somewhat"" or ""extremely"" compounded their current debt, while 37% of respondents expressed concern about the ability to clear the debt they incurred during the holidays.And to the NerdWallet CEO's point, consumer sentiment survey data from the University of Michigan has shown hints of unease.“Overall, high prices continue to weigh on consumers despite the recent moderation in inflation, and sentiment remains more than 22% below its historical average since 1978,"" Joanna Hsu, Survey of Consumers Director, said, contextualizing the preliminary consumer sentiment reading for February.

A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&amp;A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.Ward Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that in 2022, Martin Marietta delivered our most profitable year and our 11th consecutive year of growth for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. Martin Marietta also achieved a world class total injury incident rate for the second year in a row and a world class lost time incident rate for the sixth consecutive year. We delivered these record results along with platform M&amp;A integration and multiple portfolio optimization actions amid a challenging macroeconomic setting that included a housing slowdown, monetary tightening and 40-year high inflation. Martin Marietta's accomplishments are a testament to our team's steadfast commitments to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan.Most importantly, the company is well-positioned to deliver another record year in 2023. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few takeaways from the fourth quarter. While pricing growth significantly accelerated, product shipments were adversely affected by inclement weather and a number of key Martin Marietta geographies. As a reminder, we're comparing 2022 results against the fourth quarter of 2021 when we benefited from unseasonably warm and dry weather that extended the construction season late into the year. With this context, aggregates shipments decreased 12% against the prior year quarter. Yet, as we began 2023, aggregates customers' backlogs remained healthy and shipment trends thus far are ahead of planned levels.Aggregates pricing in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased a robust 16.5%, a quarterly record or 5.6% sequentially, providing attractive tailwinds into 2023. Further, despite the weather impacts on operating leverage and acceleration of certain operating expenses, pricing growth drove aggregates gross margin expansion and improved gross profit per ton shipped by 25% over the prior year quarter. In summary, for the final quarter of 2022, poor weather was a literal headwind. The 2023 stage has been set, both operationally and commercially. Now, let's turn to our full year 2022 results and the new financial records we set for an 11th consecutive year in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated products and services revenues of $5.7 billion, a 13% increase, consolidated gross profit of $1.4 billion, a 6% increase, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a 5% increase.These results underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions in 2022. As a result, we achieved double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines. However, we were not immune to the rapid and significant inflationary pressures that impacted our operating costs and affected our product gross margin, which declined 160 basis points to 24.9% for the year. As an example, 2022s results included $178 million of energy cost headwinds, an over 55% increase compared with 2021. It bears repeating that inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for our upstream materials, the benefits of which long endure after inflationary pressures abate.We believe our multiple commercial actions enacted in 2022, coupled with broad customer support of our January 1st, 2023 price increases will drive meaningful pricing acceleration and margin expansion in 2023. Let's now turn to our full year operating performance, beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments increasing 3.3% to 208 million tons. Aggregate pricing fundamentals remain very attractive as pricing increased 10.6% or 10% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record yearly shipments of 4.2 million tons and pricing growth of 16.9%.We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future based on market trends and the success of our January 1st price increases. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, prior year shipment comparability for ready mixed concrete is notably impacted by last April's divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and only partially offset by our Arizona acquisition. Cumulatively, concrete shipments decreased 25.4% and pricing increased 11.3%, reflecting multiple pricing actions in the year, including fuel surcharges in order to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost increases. Asphalt shipments increased 28.4% driven by contributions from our acquired California and Arizona operations, which also impacts the prior year comparability.Pricing improved 23.6%, following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our 2022 discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?Jim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted record products and services revenues of $5.45 billion, a 13.4% increase over last year and a product gross profit record of $1.34 billion, an 8.1% increase. Aggregates product gross profit improved 8.3% relative to the prior year, achieving a record $980 million. Aggregates product gross margin declined 160 basis points to 28%, as robust pricing growth throughout the year did not serve to offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs until the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Texas cement business delivered an all-time record top and bottom line results. Product revenues increased 21.8% to $602 million, while product gross profit increased 30.1% to $204 million.Construction, Material, Construction sitesPhoto by Mikita Yo on UnsplashImportantly, execution of our disciplined commercial approach drove product gross margin expansion of 210 basis points to 33.9% despite significant energy cost headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. 2022 was a great year for our strategic cement business. It's worth highlighting this business growth and performance over the last three years. Since 2019, shipments are up 8%, while product revenues are up 37%. Revenue has grown over 4.5 times faster than shipments, demonstrating the team's commitment to commercial excellence. Over that same timeframe, gross profit is up 42% despite energy costs doubling. And consistent operational improvements focused on reliability and efficiency have brought increased production and higher margins.This journey of growth is far from complete. As previously disclosed, our Midlothian plant has several initiatives underway to improve production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024. The other initiatives remain on-track and have already provided additional capacity. At both the Midlothian and Hunter plants, we have largely completed converting our construction cement customers from Type 1 and Type 2 cement to the less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. The cumulative efforts of our capital expenditures at Midlothian and the conversion to Type 1L resulted in growing production volumes by 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 levels.We expect those efforts to provide an additional capacity expansion of 5% in 2023. Our ready mixed concrete product revenues declined 17% to $931 million, and product gross profit declined 27.2% to $70 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and partially offset by contributions from our acquired Arizona operations impacting prior year comparability. Increased aggregates and cement costs further weighed on gross margin, which declined 100 basis points to 7.3%. Our 2022 asphalt and paving results include the acquired California and Arizona operations impacting comparability with the prior year. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $775 million, a 50.8% increase over the prior year.Product gross profit increased $3 million to $82 million, while continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to product gross margin decline of 480 basis points to 10.6%. Magnesia Specialties generated product revenues of $278 million, a 1.2% increase over the prior year. However, higher energy, supplies and contract services expenses resulted in a product gross profit decline of 13.5% of $96 million, and product gross margin compression of 580 basis points to 34.4%. Our full year energy expense was $178 million or 55% higher than the prior year and diesel fuel accounted for approximately half of that cost increase. While diesel cost increases moderated in the fourth quarter, they remained a headwind. Our 2023 guidance assumes that the cost per gallon of diesel falls only modestly from current elevated levels.We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $309 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As a reminder, in August 2022, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.In October, the Federal Trade Commission issued a second request for information related to this pending transaction and we continue to work towards closing this matter in a timely manner. At December 31st, 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times after a year of robust M&amp;A activity. In 2022, our stated focus was on integrating these new operations into our business, executing portfolio enhancing divestitures and deleveraging to within the Company's targeted range. As a result, we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by year's end. Exiting the year with a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investments in attractive upstream acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders.With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.Ward Nye: Thanks Jim. We're finally enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we build upon the foundation established in 2022. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to support multiyear demand for our products across infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors, thereby improving the durability of our business through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Starting first with infrastructure. The value of state and local governments highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator of future demand, grew 24% to a record $102 billion in 2022.By comparison, the compounded annual growth rate for combined highway and bridge awards from 2018 through 2021, was 1.7%. State Departments of Transportation or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states remain robustly funded with budgets all above or in line with prior year levels and are well-positioned from a resource aspect and desire perspective to deploy the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. In addition to the multiyear funding from the IIJA in December 2022, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package. Included in the package is the Cornyn-Padilla amendment allowing states and local municipalities to use unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. It's estimated this alone will provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding for Martin Marietta's top 10 states.Importantly, investments in our nation's infrastructure maintains broad public support. During the November 2022 election, voters nationwide approved 87% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $23 billion of additional infrastructure funding. A few notable funding initiatives include $15 billion in Texas, $3 billion in San Francisco, $1.3 billion in South Carolina, through a sales tax addition and $1 billion in Colorado, through the renewal of a sales tax addition. We expect this significantly enhanced level of federal, state and local infrastructure investment to yield multiyear demand for our products in this important counter-cyclical end market and drive aggregates shipments to infrastructure closer to our 10-year historical average of 39% of total shipments, as compared to 35% in 2022.Moving now to nonresidential construction, industrial projects of scale, led by energy, onshore manufacturing and datacenters, continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential product shipments. Over the medium term, we expect that enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act will further support and accelerate post-pandemic secular growth trends. This includes restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains, the electric vehicle transition and continued adoption of digital and cloud-based technologies resulting in robust demand within the heavy nonresidential sector. In our supplemental materials, we outlined examples of both in-process and recently announced large industrial projects in our key markets, reflective of these trends.The aggregates intensive nature and multiyear duration of these projects are expected to extend the nonresidential construction cycle. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted light commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect these gains will moderate as these categories generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Shifting to residential. We expect this segment shipments to follow the trend in housing starts, which remain weak. However, we anticipate medium-term improvement as interest and mortgage rates stabilize. Moreover, we expect comparatively positive trends in our Sunbelt markets where there is a significant structural housing deficit due to a decade of underbuilding. As a result, we continue to expect the current housing slowdown will be moderate in our key metropolitan areas as affordability headwinds recede.In summary, we expect 2023 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We anticipate flat aggregates shipments at the midpoint of guidance, as we continue to expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale, we'll largely insulate product shipments from a residential slowdown and a related moderation in light commercial construction. We now expect aggregates pricing growth of 13% to 15%, underscored by attractive 2022 exit rates, early 2023 pricing momentum and a steadfast commitment to our value over volume commercial strategy, which should more than offset continued inflationary pressure and result in expanded gross margins and accelerated unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from cement, downstream operations and Magnesia Specialties, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion or a 15.6% growth year-over-year at the midpoint.As a reminder, this guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held for sale. To conclude, we are proud of our 2022 record-setting performance in a dynamic and challenging environment. Equally, we're confident about our 2023 guidance and our ability to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds, while further demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates-led business model. As such, we expect the fourth quarter commercial and margin expansion momentum to accelerate in 2023, resulting in attractive earnings growth and superior value creation for our stakeholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Andrew LudwigGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation Conference Call on Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vincent Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we'll conclude with a Q&amp;A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement.Vincent SorgiThank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end investor update. We'll keep our remarks brief this morning given the comprehensive update we shared with you on January 11. We continue to be extremely excited for PPL's bright future and the value we intend to deliver for our customers and shareowners.Story continuesJoseph P. BergsteinThank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. Our solid fourth quarter financial results closed out a great year for the company. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.02 per share primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, partially offset by a tax benefit due to the provision to final 2021 tax return adjustments primarily related to the sale of WPD.Vincent SorgiThank you, Joe. Over the past 2 years, we've taken bold steps to transform PPL for long-term growth and success and to improve shareholder return while building on our core strengths. Since then, we have continued to deliver on the goals we set, exceeding the midpoint of our 2022 earnings forecast, advancing industry-leading grid modernization, providing highly reliable electricity and gas service and economically advancing our clean energy strategy. And our plan provides investors with an attractive return proposition, one that the entire management team and I intend to deliver. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaJust two quick ones here after you guys obviously had a comprehensive update a little while ago. But just -- I know you guys are obviously targeting $50 million to $60 million of O&amp;M savings this year, but it's been kind of a super mild winter, Q1 looks to be a little bit rough. I guess how comfortable are you around the 158 midpoint when you're also layering in sort of interest expense pressures and some of the externalities we're seeing out there.Vincent SorgiYes, Shar. Look, I would just say we still remain incredibly confident in our ability to hit the '23 forecast. As you've mentioned and with many of our peers, right, I would say the most significant potential headwinds or factors that we're looking at today are interest rates and inflation. And then, of course, weather, which you referenced and its impact potentially on sales or our storm costs.Shahriar PourrezaGreat. And then just lastly, Vince -- that's helpful. Just on the Kentucky CPCN process, intervenors are obviously starting to line up looks like there's been some delays on solar PPAs and the PSC just engaged a consultant, right, to do an analysis earlier this week. Can you just speak to the process a little bit more broadly and what we should be watching for intervenors and procedurally between now and your next update in the spring?Vincent SorgiYes, sure. So the CPCN process does continue, I would say, really but on plan as was laid out in the procedural schedule. Last week, the KPSC granted several interveners, their motions to intervene short, none of those were a surprise to us. So I would say everything, again, progressing as we would have expected there. The next step is for us to get the data requests from the intervenors, which are due to us by the end of today actually.OperatorNext question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraWe were getting some questions on that, so I appreciate the color. I just had one quick follow-up, rest, everything is pretty clear. The -- you've asked for AFUDC in Kentucky, is that part of this CPCN filing? Or is that a separate decision? What should we be looking for there and how to track that specifically?Vincent SorgiYes, that will come out through the CPCN process, so that will be resolved all at the same time to get.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Okay. Perfect. And go Eagles for 2024.Vincent SorgiNot an Eagle stand, but that's okay.OperatorThe next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.Paul PattersonOn the call, I think you were -- in your prepared remarks, you were talking about like discussions with regulators about affordability and what have you. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color as to what they might be looking at and if you have a little bit more discussion about Kentucky and I guess, Pennsylvania, what you're hearing there?Vincent SorgiYes. So some of the things that we were -- we've been engaged in Pennsylvania, really with our -- with the state legislature as well as our regulator, the PUC. Most significantly, Paul, we've requested to have customers return to the EDC, so right, the companies like TTL Electric and to return to our default rate when they come off the standard offer program as that's where we've seen our customers gauge the most when they come off the standard offer plan.Paul PattersonOkay. That makes a lot of sense. This is kind of a problem that's sort of plagued choice -- retail choice jurisdictions around the country, I mean, if you look over the years, there are some places that are talking about actually limiting customer choice to more sophisticated customers. In other words, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of value that's being driven by these third-party providers in many cases. And is there any talk about that? And anywhere in any of the areas that you operate?Vincent SorgiI'm not seeing that yet, Paul. But again, so we've been engaged with our public officials over the last couple of years on trying to get some of these measures implemented, and they haven't to date, we are continuing to engage with them. I think it's more pronounced now with what we've seen with wholesale power prices and natural gas prices. So we will continue to engage on behalf of our customers to try to get -- try to get these wholesale -- or not the wholesale rates, but the rates that third-party suppliers are charging our customers.OperatorThe next question comes from Angie Storozynski of SeaportAgnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo I have a question about Kentucky. And it's -- I understand it's a bit premature, I guess. But given the time line for the approval by FERC of the Kentucky Power sale, I think it's increasingly likely that, that transaction doesn't happen. And I'm just wondering if this asset stays within AP, they're probably going to try to boost its growth profile, which that could result in additional coal plant retirements or plans to retire coal plants.Vincent SorgiYes, I'm not sure I think it would impact us one way or the other, Angie. I think, again, our CPCN has been designed to strike an appropriate balance with different fuel sources to provide that safe, reliable and affordable energy while we're replacing 1,500 megawatts, that is reaching our end of lives. We've been very clear that we have not accelerated the retirement of our coal plants.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then secondly, assuming that you do get the approval, the certificates of -- from the Kentucky Commission, would you then file a rate case to recover the investment or the plan would be either see a rider recovery or basically further cut costs to pay for the capital spending and the return on it?Vincent SorgiYes. So we do -- we are requesting AFUDC coverage for the capital investments we would be making under the CPCN. So that would provide us with the earnings aspect of making those investments before they go in service. From a cash perspective, again, one of the reasons why we have the balance sheet that we have is, it enables us to engage with our regulators to mitigate near-term rate impacts, but at the same time, get the investments done that we know we need to get done. And then we would pick that up in a rate case sometime in the '26 or later time frame.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And then lastly, this point that you brought up about retail choice. So it's kind of an interesting time, right? Because if you think -- I mean, I'm assuming that you guys had procured electricity ahead of time, so you had likely locked in elevated power prices. So wouldn't actually a retail choice makes sense to residential customers in this power price environment where power prices have fallen pretty dramatically as such that there should be a positive differential between what a retailer can offer versus what the incumbent utility offers, no?Vincent SorgiYes, you would think so, Angie. So our price to compare is about $0.14. There are suppliers out there that are below $0.10 exactly to your point. We've had to procure that power over 6, 12, 18 months time horizons in accordance with the PUC process. So yes, so we're not necessarily getting the immediate impact of the precipitous decline in energy prices over the last month or 2. Some of our suppliers are, which they're able to provide, like I said, (inaudible) $0.10 contracts, it makes it interesting that many of our customers were paying $0.20 and over $0.30 in December for their third-party supplier energy. So great point.OperatorThe next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroA couple of minor questions here. I just wanted to check on the reallocation of the Kentucky Holdco drag, I was just wondering, are there any implications there either from a regulatory perspective or from like a debt refinancing perspective as you shift that into corporate and other? Or is it really just as simple as moving around that EPS drag?Joseph P. BergsteinDave, it's Joe. It's -- there's no implications to either of those. It's really just the reallocation of those costs that we were -- we had been allocating to the Kentucky segment to -- and really from an investor perspective to align the Kentucky segment to the similar way that we had been reporting Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. So no implications there.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Got it. Great. That's helpful. And then I was just curious, would you expect ongoing elevated costs or personnel activity or anything like that on the back of the billing issues in Pennsylvania in terms of the call center resources or anything like that? Or is it going to be just temporary in terms of response there?Vincent SorgiYes. No, that will be temporary, David. We do have third-party contracts that we can lean on in times of need, which we've done. We've also reallocated some of our existing folks in other departments and train them up on the call center activity. So yes, of course, the third-party contracts, we could dial those up and down as needed and then our internal resources -- they'll just go back to their other departments when we're through with the call center duties that we have been doing.OperatorThe next question comes from Gregg Orrill of UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillJust with regard to the CPCN, how does the impact of inflation play into that with inflation supply constraints?Vincent SorgiSo those price estimates that are in our CPCN are all based on current pricing. And we ran the RFPs in the summertime. So those RFP prices are included for solar projects. And again, we're using our internal cost estimates for the combined cycle units and any of the solar that we're proposing that we build. So I would say cost estimates are up to date there. No major issues with having to adjust those with what's in the CPCN.OperatorThe next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America.Paul Andrew ZimbardoAnd good to hear about the Rhode Island reliability improvements so quick off the bat. Shifting to the of course, shifted to the gas side in Rhode Island. I know there's that future of gas proceeding ongoing. Just could you talk at a high level how that could impact the spending plans, whether in terms of magnitude or timing?Vincent SorgiYes. So it's -- we're early in that process, Paul, as you know. We did put a capital plan together to ensure the safety and reliability of the gas network while we work with the state on the future of gas docket, that will take some time to get through. Again, as we think about the gas networks, not only in Rhode Island, but across the country. We certainly see a future for those as to folks like EPRI and other independent research agencies in terms of the fuel that's flowing through those LDCs may be different.Paul Andrew ZimbardoAnd one unrelated and I know you may be a little limited in what you can say, but just is there any update on the talent litigation or arbitration now that, that bankruptcy process has wrapped up? I know it's a legacy one, but just hope we can put that one to bet sooner rather than later?Vincent SorgiYes. There is actually -- we are entering into mediation next week on February 22. That will be before one of the judges in the Texas bankruptcy court. So yes, there is an update there. We'll be heading into mediation next week.OperatorThe next question comes from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo.Neil Andrew KaltonJust a question on Rhode Island. Yes, it looks like based on the guidance for 2023 that if my math is right, it might not be that you will be significantly under-earning the ROE. So my question is, are the cost savings coming in as expected thus far? And then in terms of bridging that gap? Is this something that is ultimately going to require regulatory relief in 2026? Or can it be accomplished faster?Joseph P. BergsteinNeil, it's Joe. So a couple of points there. First on the Rhode Island guidance for 2023, I think we've discussed in the past a few times that we expect to experience some variability or noise in our Rhode Island earnings as we work through the transition period and stand up Rhode Island on our systems and processes. And so that's what you're seeing here.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Understood. And do you think by 2025, we're going to be earning close to the allowed there? Or is it -- it might take a little bit more?Joseph P. BergsteinI think '25 is certainly a normal year. We'll be off the TSAs by that period sometime in 2024. So you get a clean year '25. It will have been some time since the last rate case there. I think National Grid's less rate case was 2018. So we certainly expect to see an improvement in ROEs. We may need a rate case following that. But I think we'll continue to work through the plan and execute what we have in store there and see where we are. But we feel -- again, we feel good about the growth prospects in Rhode Island.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.Vincent SorgiThanks, everybody, for joining us. I just want to reiterate, again, really pleased with our 2022 results where we ultimately came in what we accomplished in 2022 to set us up for 2023 and beyond and just really remain confident in our ability to deliver on what we've laid out for you all. And I can tell you the entire management team is aligned around the new strategy, and we're really looking forward to delivering it. So with that, hopefully, we'll see you guys on some of the conference circuits or on MDRs and look forward to chatting with you then.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

The leading snacks company’s solid brand portfolio, backed by strategic acquisitions and innovations, is also a key driver.The abovementioned upsides were evident in the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing year over year. Management is optimistic about delivering earnings and sales growth in 2023.Let’s delve deeper.Impressive Q4 Results &amp; Bright ViewThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results gained from improved net price realization and higher consumer demand. The company delivered strong results even amid elevated inflation, continued supply-chain hurdles and macroeconomic volatility. The company posted adjusted earnings of $2.02, which increased 19.5% year over year. Consolidated net sales of $2,652.3 million rose 14% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Organic sales on a constant-currency (cc) basis rose 10.7%. Improved consumer demand across segments drove volumes.Management envisions net sales growth in the band of 6-8% for 2023. This is likely to be mainly fueled by net price realization, with consumer demand staying steady. Management expects sales and gross margin growth to outpace higher brand, capability and technology investments, along with escalated pension and interest costs. Hershey envisions a reported earnings per share (EPS) increase of 11-15% and adjusted EPS growth of 9-11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Actions SolidHershey is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance. In fourth-quarter 2022, net price realization contributed 8.5 points to organic net sales growth. The company’s net price realization increased across the North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International units. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that net price realization and greater levels of productivity are likely to keep offsetting the persistent cost of goods, labor, packaging and logistics inflation through 2023.Story continuesPrudent Acquisitions: Key DriverHershey has been undertaking buyouts to augment portfolio strength and boost revenues. In December 2021, Hershey acquired Dot’s Pretzels LLC — the owner of Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, a leading brand in the pretzel category. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels is a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. The company also purchased Pretzels Inc. from an affiliate of Peak Rock Capital. The acquisition further expands Hershey’s snacking and production capabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Hershey’s net sales included a 3.6-point benefit from the Pretzels and Dot's buyouts.On Jun 25, 2021, Hershey concluded the acquisition of Lily's, a leading better-for-you (BFY) confectionery brand. The buyout is in tandem with Hershey’s focus on creating an impressive BFY confection portfolio as part of its multi-pronged, better-for-you snacking strategy.Brand Strength &amp; Focus on InnovationHershey’s core brands — Hershey’s, Reese’s, Hershey’s Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Brookside, Sofit and Ice Breakers — have been growing strongly on the back of advertising investments, in-store merchandising and programming and innovation. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that its Reese’s retail sales grew 10.5% for 2022 despite capacity constraints. In fact, retail sales for Skinny Pop, Pirate’s Booty and Dot’s have more than doubled over the last three years.Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs.We believe that the aforementioned upsides are likely to fuel growth for HersheyHSY’s stock has risen 4.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%.Other Top-Ranked Food BetsSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Lamb Weston LW and Mondelez International, Inc.

MDLZ appears in a solid position. The company has been benefiting from its focus on expanding the snacking category. To this end, Mondelez’s prudent acquisitions and innovation have been working well. Also, strength in emerging markets has been a driver for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.These upsides drove the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from the resilience of the company’s snacking products, brand strength, broad-based growth across regions, categories and brands, continued strength in emerging and developed markets and gains from its recent acquisitions.Driven by solid quarterly results and continued momentum in the snacks business, management issued upbeat guidance for 2023. For 2023, it expects organic net revenues of 5-7%.The company envisions a high-single-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share or EPS at cc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has risen from $3.12 to $3.17 over the past 30 days. Let’s take a closer look at the key drivers of this snack food and beverage product company.Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteAll That’s Working Well for MondelezMondelez’s core chocolate and biscuit categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Management is focused on expanding these categories as these have considerable scope for growth (in terms of penetration and per capita consumption). Mondelez intends to generate around 90% of its revenues through these two core categories in the long run.Mondelez has undertaken several acquisitions to strengthen its snacking portfolio. In its third-quarter 2022 earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.Further, Mondelez acquired the Chipita S.A. business in January 2022, which is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from the Ricolino, Clif Bar and Chipita buyouts boosted net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022. Management expects to gain from the Ricolino and Clif Bar buyouts in 2023.Mondelez is committed to increasing its focus on areas with higher growth potential.

(ARHS) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arhaus-inc-arhs-hit-52-141502893.html,1676643302,STORY,"['ARHS', 'ULTA']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Arhaus, Inc. (ARHS)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $15.27 in the previous session. Arhaus, Inc. has gained 49.5% since the start of the year compared to the 9.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 10.7% return for the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 10, 2022, Arhaus, Inc. reported EPS of $0.27 versus consensus estimate of $0.15.For the current fiscal year, Arhaus, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share on $1.23 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.09 per share on $1.4 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 0.96% and 14.05%, respectively.Valuation MetricsArhaus, Inc. may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Arhaus, Inc. has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 16.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.4X versus its peer group's average of 6.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.04. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Arhaus, Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Arhaus, Inc. meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Arhaus, Inc. shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does ARHS Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ARHS have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA). ULTA has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Ulta Beauty Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 30.56%, and for the current fiscal year, ULTA is expected to post earnings of $24.26 per share on revenue of $9.99 billion.Shares of Ulta Beauty Inc. have gained 8.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.91X and a P/CF of 22.94X.The Retail - Miscellaneous industry is in the top 40% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ARHS and ULTA, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That large chemical spill and fires drawing responses from government agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, EPA has already sent a letter notifying-- in a formal way notifying Norfolk Southern of its responsibilities. Obviously I can't get ahead of an investigation that is active and ongoing, but Norfolk Southern will have to answer to EPA for the environmental side and to our department if there were any violations of rules that were found that emerge in the NTSB process.JULIE HYMAN: Of course that was from our conversation with Buttigieg earlier in the week, and he is one of many politicians and regulators examining the company right now. You guys, the shares down about 8%, almost 9%, I believe, since this derailment first happened on February 3, and there doesn't seem a resolution. I've seen a lot of different estimates as to how much this could ultimately cost the company. We're talking tens of millions easily.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And for what goes on from here from the investigation, I think there are so many locals that are really just looking for answers, and it raises a larger question of what type of change will be sparked or prompted after this knowing that there have been calls for better air quality coming through communities, better ability to have even for some of the kind of highways, the different train routes that go through certain parts of cities-- what exactly is traveling on those train routes as well, and that was something that he acknowledged in our interview too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, this has all the makings really of something that lives on in Norfolk Southern's annual report or 10-K for the next 10 years, not unlike something we saw from Monsanto a couple years ago and that's still in their annual reports about lawsuits because of various chemicals they put out.But, of course, you know, this is a longer-term issue. It could be financial penalties. Does it mean broader things to the railroad industry? Even-- you could even go so far as to say is Warren Buffett's Burlington Northern Railroad impacted in some way? Do they have to reinvent their tracks? It's wildly unclear, but, I mean, that's how investors in the space should be thinking.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and obviously people in that town also in a more immediate fashion want to know exactly what's safe and what's not.]"

We heard from a number of consumer staples stocks, not only this week, but going over what we heard from the last couple of weeks, and specifically when it comes to Coke, the comments during this earnings call just about what it's telling us when it comes to the consumer-- the strength of the consumer. Coke saying in its call that US demand continues to remain strong, that they do have the pricing power.It seems like the Street does agree with it. Citi initiating coverage on the stock this week with a buy rating, a $68 price target, about $8 higher from where Coca-Cola closed the week. Citi making the argument that in the near-term, they see the potential topline EPS upside with momentum exiting Q4, strong pricing power, and solid emerging markets growth. So certainly, Coca-Cola seems to have an edge over some of its competitors, at least at this point.DAVE BRIGGS: Bad Fed story? I always wonder this with Coke, because they have continued to raise those prices well beyond, on top of inflation, showing no real-- I mean, a slight pullback in overall volume, slight downtick in terms of volume and demand, but not hurting their bottom line. The stock is up 5% in the last five days, up 10% this year.And they are going to continue to raise prices. They were told by a bottler that glass prices will continue to increase double-digits this year. So will we continue to pay those prices at Coca-Cola? It certainly looks like it. They're banking on it, with the notable exception of juices. That's the only place they really saw a pullback in terms of the consumer.]"

Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.Tim Leveridge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted schedules under Financial Information in the Investors section of our company website at coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You can also find schedules in the same section of our website that provide an analysis of our gross and operating margins. In addition, this call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, which should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's periodic SEC reports.Following prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing first, and then reenter the queue. Now, let me turn the call over to James.Story continuesJames Quincey: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a strong year for us. We executed well and grew amidst a challenging macro environment. We did this in part by focusing on expanding the spear of what we can control. We delivered on our top line and bottom line guidance, and we continue to create value by investing in our loved brands, even as we faced a very dynamic backdrop. Today, I'll reflect on our fourth quarter and the year's performance and set the stage for 2023. I'll also share how we're operating differently today, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 guidance, and well equipped for a future that continues to be volatile and uncertain. John will then discuss our results and our 2023 outlook in more detail.During the fourth quarter, the environment remained dynamic as inflation, geopolitical tensions, pandemic-related mobility restrictions and currency volatility persisted. Despite this range of factors, consumer demand held up relatively well, and our industry remains strong. In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our growth strategy and continued to create value for our consumers and customers. We maintained agility to navigate this challenging environment and delivered 15% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with strong growth across operating segments. This was driven by pricing actions across markets and revenue growth management initiatives to retain and add consumers. While we saw robust volume growth across many markets, this was more than offset by the suspension of our business in Russia and the impact on consumption, driven by varying levels of pandemic-related mobility restrictions and the surge in COVID cases in China.Overall, throughout 2022, we have maintained consistent volume growth relative to 2019. We've gained both volume and value share for the consolidated business for both the quarter and the year. So far, in 2023, the volume growth trends versus 2019 are in line with last year, and we are laser-focused on executing on our growth plans. Our streamlined portfolio of global and local brands and stepped-up consumer-facing investments continue to fuel the competitive edge of the Coca-Cola system to deliver value in any environment. Our network organizational structure enables this strategy. We've connected our operating units, our functions and our platform services organization for strong end-to-end coordination, which helps us identify key opportunities for meaningful long-term growth.And on top of this, we remain well aligned with our bottling partners, which further builds on our strength as a network system. As we look to 2023, many uncertainties remain in the macro economy, whether from economic policies, consumer demand, inflation, supply chain, war and geopolitics. Instead of trying to forecast and predict the many directions things could move, we are focused on delivering on our key objectives: firstly, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to continue the top line momentum; secondly, investing for the long-term health of the business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel; thirdly, generating US dollar EPS growth to deliver value for our shareowners.We continue to build the right capabilities and strengthen the system alignment to deliver in a dynamic world, and we continue to invest to raise the bar. We are executing more efficiently and effectively on a local level while maintaining flexibility on a global level. Throughout 2022, we saw many examples of harnessing our enhanced capabilities to win locally. Our new marketing model is working. We've linked occasions and passion points to drive engagement. We're experimenting to optimize marketing. This is driving deeper connections with consumers, reaching them in unique and new ways. We are tying our beverages to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. For example, in Vietnam, to support the reopening of away-from-home accounts, we launched the pilot of Coke is Cooking campaign in October.In this month-long campaign to help drive traffic back to stores, we partner with more than 700 food shops. We created thousands of food and Coke combo deals that consumers purchased at these food shops, along with Coke is Cooking merchandising and digital support by our local influencers. This was the first time we used an on-ground event as a commercial asset, creating a social and digital content generator. The campaign resulted in more than 1 million combo transactions and 20% uplift for participating merchants. We're leveraging passion points locally to create immersive experiences and drive consumption. For example, in Latin America, our live music strategy created memorable in-person and digital experiences, elevating consumer engagement.We partnered with Rock in Rio, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, and creating new opportunities for consumers to access content through live streams and in the metaverse. As a result, we boosted our reach from approximately 700,000 attendees to more than 45 million consumers across the region, and our sales inside the festival increased 23% versus the last festival. In India, the Thums Up, Stump Cam was a never before seen activation for cricket fans where consumers could scan a QR code on product label and get access to exclusive match moments of the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup through a camera installed on one of the wickets. Throughout the 45-day tournament, we use first-party data and artificial intelligence to send personalized content to consumers based on their favorite matches, and we amplified the experience through sports influencers.This campaign showed strong results with Thums Up growing volume ahead of our total sparkling portfolio in India during the activation period, contributing to strong volume growth for Thums Up for the full year. This drove about 1/4 of India's total volume growth for the year. Thums Up also experienced its highest monthly market share jump during the activation period. We are driving consumer interest and action through digital experiences using the power of partnerships across platforms. For example, in Germany, we partnered with our key online customer and created voice-based branded experiences with its voice assistant to drive engagement and grow positive brand perception. This allowed consumers to learn more about Coca-Cola products and shop on voice assistant-enabled devices using only their voice.The campaign delivered strong results with a reach of 11 million impressions. Additionally, consumers that engaged with its voice-based experience had a 25% add-to-cart rate. And lastly, we're delivering new and unexpected innovation by leveraging Gen Z insights. In the US, we launched Minute Maid Aguas Frescas. The product is made with real fruit juices is noncarbonated and comes in three exciting flavors. It was originally available as a limited launch in 16-ounce ready-to-drink cans. A disruptive end-to-end digital media marketing campaign created early momentum, which led us to quickly scale this experiment to our Freestyle platform and other fountain offerings. In 2022, the product had a 60% repeat rate and won the Best New Product award from Convenience Store News.We have been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities for many years, and we've made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset much of the inflation we saw in 2022 and delivered strong volume and transaction growth. There is still much work to be done to maximize revenue by further segmenting our markets and consumers based on additional variables. We are leveraging digital and data-backed insights to better understand our consumers. This will help drive affordable propositions for basket incidence growth and recruit new drinkers. It will also lead to premiumization to drive price and mix. For example, in Europe, we grew both volume and value share for the last year. We partnered with key customers to drive growth through affordability and premiumization initiatives that tapped into the key consumption occasions of meals and breaks.Coca Cola, Brand, JuicePhoto by SJ Objio on UnsplashThis end-to-end execution resulted in higher basket incidents and buying households across all key channels in Europe. Globally, this strong system execution focus generated 80 million additional shopping trips for our products and added 17 million households to our base. Through our stepped-up capabilities, we are getting better at synchronizing demand creation and demand fulfillment, driving top-tier value creation for our customers. We measure success by the value we create for our stakeholders and by how we are creating a better shared future for people, communities and the planet. During 2022, we made progress across these sustainability priorities. We leveraged our marketing power to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie beverages and continue to provide smaller package choices to enable consumers to manage sugar intake.Approximately two-thirds of the products in our portfolio have less than 100 calories per 12-ounce serving. On packaging, we've set a new industry-leading goal to have 25% of our volume globally being refillable or reusable packaging by 2030. Additionally, we are continuing to increase cooler energy efficiency and the use of HFC free coolers to make progress on our science-based targets, while creating a clear road map with our system and suppliers to achieve our carbon emissions reduction ambition. On water, as part of our 2030 water security strategy, we stepped up investments in nature-based water solutions exemplified by the work we're doing with the Nature Conservancy and other partners. Globally, we are working to strengthen the links between replenishment projects and nature-based solutions.We further embedded sustainability into our strategy by linking diversity equity inclusion performance measures to our executive annual incentive program and by linking water and our PET packaging measures to our executives' long-term incentive program. Overall, we continue to focus on using our leadership and scale to drive change while delivering results and building resilience. Finally, before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that our strong results in 2022 reflect the collective efforts of our system partners and the growth mindset of our system employees. Guided by our purpose, we are investing behind our capabilities and further cultivating our growth mindset to be well positioned to create value and deliver on our objectives.While we have momentum in our business, we know uncertainty remains as we turn the page to a new year. We will continue to focus on expanding the sphere of what we can control to drive growth in 2023 and beyond. We'll talk about this in more detail when we return to CAGNY in person next Tuesday and would encourage all of you to listen in. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong top line-led results as we execute for growth in a dynamic operating environment. We grew organic revenues 15%. Unit cases declined 1% as broad-based growth across most markets and investments in the marketplace were more than offset by the suspension of business in Russia and the decline in China. Concentrate sales were 3 points ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by one additional day and the timing of concentrate shipments. Our price/mix growth of 12% was driven by pricing actions across operating segments along with revenue growth management initiatives and favorable channel and package mix. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was down approximately 90 basis points versus the prior year, mainly driven by currency headwinds in a volatile macro backdrop and the mechanical effect of consolidating the BODYARMOR finished goods business.Underlying gross margin was in line with the prior year, driven by strong organic revenue growth offset by higher commodity costs. We continued to significantly accelerate our marketing investments to engage and retain existing consumers as well as, again, new consumers. Despite higher costs across the P&amp;L, increased marketing and currency headwinds, comparable operating margin expanded 65 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by underlying operating margin expansion due to robust top line growth across operating segments. Importantly, this resulted in full year comparable operating margin be in line with the prior year despite significant currency acquisition and cost headwinds. Below the line, we were impacted by higher net interest expense, along with lower other income due to cycling higher pension income from the prior year.Therefore, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.45 was in line with last year despite higher-than-expected currency headwinds. This resulted in full year comparable EPS of $2.48, an increase of 7% versus the prior year, driven by strong underlying business performance, partially offset by 10 points of currency headwinds. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $9.5 billion, a decline of 15% versus the prior year. Much of the decline versus our expectations occurred due to the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment and higher-than-anticipated tax payments. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by cycling working capital benefits from the prior year and higher incentive payments in 2022. Even with these items, our underlying cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to make progress on our cash flow agenda.Our three-year average free cash flow conversion ratio is above 100%, ahead of our long-term target. Our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt leverage of 1.8 times EBITDA as of the end of 2022, which is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth, as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareowners. At the same time, we remain mindful of maintaining our financial flexibility amidst the ongoing tax dispute with the IRS and are learning from the last few years of how important it is to build resilience in all of our plans. As James mentioned, in 2023, we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic.We have the right portfolio, a very focused strategy, a flexible and adaptable structure and a system with the ability to reinvest in the business. This gives us the confidence that we will continue to deliver on our three key objectives, pursuing excellence globally, and winning locally; investing for the long-term health of the business; generating US dollar EPS growth. With that in mind, this morning, we provided guidance for 2023 that builds on our strong results in 2022. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%, primarily led by price/mix amidst the ongoing inflationary environment. And we expect comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 7% to 9% versus 2022. Since we provided our initial outlook on currency in October, the currency environment has improved, but remains volatile.Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate two to three-point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate three to four-point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we expect per-case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single-digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to be 19.5% for 2023. And all in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.48 in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments.I would like to highlight that included in the $11.4 billion of cash from operations are two discrete items: transition tax payments of approximately $720 million; a scheduled increase of $335 million versus 2022; payments associated with various M&amp;A transactions of approximately $350 million. Excluding these, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. Recently, the tax court issued an opinion on a case involving a separate company. The tax court will now apply this opinion to our case and ultimately render a final decision in our case, allowing us to move forward with the appeals process. As previously discussed, we intend to assert our claims on appeal, vigorously defend our position and believe we will ultimately prevail.Overall, we don't expect this to have a bearing on our ability to deliver on our capital allocation agenda and drive long-term business growth. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2023. We expect price mix to moderate through the year as we cycle our pricing initiatives from the prior year. While the inflationary environment appears to be cooling, we are still expecting to see elevated inflation, across our operating costs. We have stepped up our marketing investments for the last few years and we will continue to invest to support momentum. And given the ongoing backdrop of rising interest rates, we expect to see higher net interest expense given our effective exposure to floating rate debt. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and one additional day in the fourth quarter.Having delivered strong results in 2022, we are focused on driving a top line-led growth equation in many types of environments. We are well positioned to deliver on guidance for 2023, thanks to the incredible people we have around the world, the strong alignment we have with our bottling partners and the great plans we have for the coming year. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.See also 10 Best Three-Row SUVs of 2023 and 12 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-waste-management-110015033.html,1676718015,STORY,['WM'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Waste Management Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.58bUS$2.42bUS$2.93bUS$3.23bUS$3.43bUS$3.59bUS$3.72bUS$3.84bUS$3.95bUS$4.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x12Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.49%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.25%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.5kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$54b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$155, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.987. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Commercial Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

This company, which is in the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This natural gas and electricity provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.42%.For the last reported quarter, Sempra came out with earnings of $1.97 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 per share, representing a surprise of 10.06%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.98 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.79%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Sempra. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Sempra has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

276,d7b57261-88d2-365c-8049-4027bb80973b,VLO,2023-02-18,4 Stocks to Buy From the Thriving Refining & Marketing Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-thriving-refining-134001297.html,1676641201,STORY,"['PBF', 'MPC', 'MUSA', 'VLO', '^GSPC']","[Since coming out of the pandemic, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has witnessed strong demand across all product lines. While the rise in inflation throughout 2022 has driven costs up materially, the space continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals and strong margins. As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, refining and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Valero Energy VLO, PBF Energy PBF and Murphy USA MUSA have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureGrowing Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 5% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Strong Margins: The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs in 2022. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high. Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Inflation in the Marketplace: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. In fact, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 79.6% in the past year.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 21.8% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 17%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 6.8%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.32X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.22X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.23X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.46X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

TOL is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jan 31, 2023) results on Feb 21, after the closing bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.4% and 15.4%, respectively. Earnings and revenues also increased 54.6% and 22.1%, respectively, from the prior year on the back of higher pricing.On an encouraging note, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 19 of the 20 trailing quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter earnings has decreased to $1.37 per share from $1.38 over the past 60 days. The said figure indicates a 10.5% rise from the year-ago earnings of $1.24 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, suggesting a 2.7% year-over-year decrease.Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseToll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseToll Brothers Inc. price-eps-surprise | Toll Brothers Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteToll Brothers’ fiscal first-quarter home sales are expected to have decreased from the year-ago level despite higher pricing due to ongoing challenges in the industry comprising a softer demand environment. The increase in mortgage rates since March 2022, along with uncertain macroeconomic conditions, are playing the spoilsport.Nonetheless, a lack of available supply and its focus on luxury move-up buyers — who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger and better homes — will somewhat contribute to the revenues. Toll Brothers has been enjoying greater pricing power than other homebuilding companies as these homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. The company has also been benefiting from the strategy of broadening its product lines, price points and geographies.During the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, TOL highlighted that it expects home deliveries of 1,750-1,850 units (indicating a decrease from 1,929 units delivered in the prior-year quarter) at an average price of $950,000-$970,000 (suggesting a rise from $874,700 a year ago).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the home sales revenue is pegged at $1,722 million, indicating a decline from $3,581 million sequentially but a slight increase from $1,687.4 million a year ago.Now, unprecedented supply-chain issues, increased inflation and higher land, labor and raw material costs are expected to have put pressure on fiscal first-quarter margins. That said, the company has been tightening its costs which are expected to reflect in its quarterly result.Toll Brothers expects the adjusted home sales gross margin to be 27%, implying an increase from 25.6% in the year-ago period. SG&amp;A expenses are estimated to be 13.5% of home sales revenues, indicating a slight rise from 13.4% in the year-ago period. Also, the company expects the effective tax rate to be 26%.EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the backlog is pegged at 7,501 units, indicating a decline from $11,302 million a year ago. The same for the backlog (in values) is pegged at $7,983 million implying a decline from $8,874 million at the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022-end. The consensus estimate for net signed contracts is pegged at 1,198 units. This indicates a decline from the prior-year figure of 2,929 units.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Toll Brothers this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.18%.

The metrics also rose from the year-ago quarter’s levels, thanks to higher volumes and pricing.MTH’s quarterly earnings of $7.09 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.03 by 0.9% and increased by 13% year over year from $6.25 posted a year ago. The uptrend was due to higher home closing revenue, improved overhead leverage and a lower outstanding share count.D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.DHI’s chairman of the board, Donald R. Horton, said, “Beginning in June 2022 and continuing through today, we have seen a moderation in housing demand caused by significant increases in mortgage interest rates and general economic uncertainty. While these pressures may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.”NVR, Inc. NVR reported fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein this homebuilding and mortgage banking company’s earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.NVR reported earnings of $133.44 per share, which surpassed the consensus mark of $104.10 by 28.2%.

Here he poses with aircraft at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.Jaime Gates remembers the moment he knew he wanted to become a pilot. It was a summer trip in 1997, 12-year-old Jaime and his Boy Scouts of America troop got to tour New York's LaGuardia Airport. The up-close perspective of the aircraft made an ever-lasting impression on him.""As soon as I went up to the air traffic control tower and watched the planes land and take off - I was hooked,"" he said. Today, Jaime works with 12-year-old (and younger) students in his free time to help them realize their dreams of working in the aviation industry.He strives to inspire young people in his hometown of Brooklyn, New York, to soar to new heights by sharing his passion for aviation because he knows how access is the key to igniting the spark that can shape their futures.Jaime pursued his passion for flying after he graduated college in Charlotte, North Carolina, continuing his journey into aviation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. When the recession hit in 2008, Jaime knew he had to put his aspirations of becoming a pilot on hold to meet his financial needs. He decided to pursue a career in computer science for more immediate stability and joined American as a Customer Service Manager in 2011, giving him the opportunity to work in the industry he loves.""I knew I wanted to be a pilot very early on, but there weren't many resources for me at the time,"" Jaime said. ""I had no idea what path to take, and I didn't have a mentor to guide me on my journey … that along with creating more financial stability is why I had to set my dreams aside.""Jaime's mother, Dr. Lena Gates, has been the principal of the Ronald E. McNair Public School 5 in Brooklyn for more than 30 years. She was inspired to start an aviation program at her elementary school as she watched Jaime's love for aviation grow.Story continuesJaime recalled sitting down with his mom and thinking through the barriers he faced in embarking on his own pilot career, wondering how they could better support students' journeys into aviation and what hurdles they could help flatten?They started with access. If you can see yourself there, you can be there. ""We begin to dream as early as elementary school,"" Jaime said. ""So, if we provide the seed at the early stages of students' liv es, they may plant their roots and grow a career in aviation.""At a management meeting in April 2022, Jaime and his fellow team members were called on by American Airlines leadership to be intentional and impactful by reaching out to underrepresented communities to search for its next generation of aviators.""That's when the light bulb went off for me. I boldly asked if American would be open to supporting the aviation program at my mother's school,"" Jaime said. ""Everyone was on board and wanted to get started immediately - and I was absolutely thrilled.""In October 2022, the American Airlines Aviation Recruiting team and New York Flight office partnered with the Ronald E. McNair Public School 5 to rebrand the school's aviation center. American is helping the school expose its students to the power of flight at an early age and encouraging them to dream big.""When the students look up, they see themselves represented around the classroom. And when they have questions, pilots from the American's New York Flight office frequently visit to provide mentorship and support them,"" Jaime said.Jaime said the most important reason for connecting American Airlines to the school is to expose the students to a profession they might not see as available. ""This career path has the potential to change generational recurrences and the trajectory of many families in my hometown,"" he said. ""With the achievable pathway laid out by the American Airlines Cadet Academy, students can graduate high school and streamline into the commercial industry.""After putting his dream on hold 10 years ago, the passion in the eyes of the students at his mom's school reignited Jaime's dream of becoming a commercial airline pilot. He applied and was recently accepted into the American Airlines Cadet Academy program. Now he's back on course to live out his dream of becoming a pilot.""It's like all the stars aligned for me, and I've been on cloud nine from the moment I first approached American with the idea. To see American come into the classroom and help support my mother's school and to now live out my own dream, it's so special to see it all come together.""His next goal is to focus on becoming a commercial pilot while continuing to give back to communities and expand his reach to surrounding areas that need support and mentorship.Through the support of American Airlines, the program has reached new heights in its community and is paving the way for generational success.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739885/One-Mans-Passion-Inspires-the-Power-of-Flight-for-Local-School-Kids]"

For first-quarter 2023, AAL’s earnings are expected to register 100.4% growth on a year-over-year basis. For 2023, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 332% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks consensus for the company’s earnings is pegged at 1 cent for first-quarter 2023 and $2.16 for the full year.

The stock has risen 10.4% compared to the industry's growth of 7% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Earnings HistoryIn the trailing four quarters, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings three times (missing on one instance). The average surprise is a positive of 7.8%.Bullish Industry RankThe industry to which American Airlines belongs currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 66 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the industry in the top 26% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.Notably, a mediocre stock in a healthy group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a poor industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into account becomes necessary.Attractive Rank &amp; Style ScoreAAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesOther Positive FactorsThe improved air travel demand seems to benefit AAL, particularly in the domestic business. The effect of the same is visible in the recent fourth-quarter earnings of the company. The company reported earnings of $1.17 per share, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.63%.Recently, the company was declared as the eco airline of the world by Air Transport World, courtesy of its efforts and investments for fleet renewal, along with an environmentally-friendly attitude.The carrier has taken impressive debt reduction steps as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025-end. The company aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization.As part of the expansion drive, the carrier began service to Chetumal, Mexico, and San Andres Island, Colombia, from the Miami International Airport in December 2021. The airline’s codeshare agreement with India's low-cost airline, IndiGo, is an added positive.The company expects the total capacity to go up 5-8% in 2023 from the previous year. The company also expects its costs to go up 2-5% with the cost of fuel per gallon pegged at $3-$3.10. The company aims at expanding its fleet size to 957 from 925 by 2022 end.

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.American Airlines (AAL) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 0.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this world's largest airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. AAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 13.7% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for AAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.54. This indicates that the stock moves 54% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that AAL has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped AAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, AAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. AAL is currently trading at 0.22 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 22 cents for each dollar of sales.So, AAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to AAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

286,769f7a83-a3a4-3689-91a6-eb7c48d4ff3c,PFG,2023-02-18,Black History Month: ‘Building an Inclusive Culture With Care and Consideration’,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-history-month-building-inclusive-173000934.html,1676655000,STORY,['PFG'],"[Originally published on Principal.ComNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2023 / Growing up in a mostly Black church, Capris Olson recalls gospel songs and programs that filled up February in recognition of Black History Month. ""These memories are special to me because they show the lasting impact of celebrating Black History Month with children at a young age,"" says Olson, who manages individual life new business teams at Principal®.While Black History Month began as mostly a school-focused learning experience, in the last few decades, workplaces like Principal have also provided opportunities for marking the month. Through them, employees can learn, connect, and engage to drive action and change.1From the classroom to the officeLike Olson, Durant Knox has memories of education intersecting with Black History Month.""I recall working on school projects that involved researching African Americans that have had a significant impact on the world, and one was scientist and inventor George Washington Carver,"" says Knox, who manages a customer care group at Principal. ""Reflecting on Carver's accomplishments, along with those of many other great people, helped me to see that I can achieve anything I set my mind to with the correct support system in place.""Even with those school efforts, there were and still are shortfalls. ""Much of Black history has not been taught in our public schools, and so as individuals must actively seek it out,"" says Teresa Hassara, senior vice president with Principal.Hassara tries to take time throughout the month to expand her understanding of the Black experience in the U.S., ""so different than my own,"" she says. Last year, she read The Burning, about the Tulsa Race Massacre. This year, she's participating in Rachel Cargle's #DiscoverOurGlory 30-day challenge. ""I believe to be a better ally, friend, and colleague, we need to invest in learning more about each other, and that deeper knowledge can lead to more empathy, equity, and inclusion.""Story continuesHelping change systems for goodSupport systems, of course, also haven't always functioned well-or at all-for Black people.Take generational wealth: Redlining, segregation, and legislation were just a few obstacles that historically stood in the way of the American dream of home ownership. The effects are apparent today: Home ownership rates for Black Americans and home ownership values in predominately Black neighborhoods are significantly less than those for white Americans and in predominantly white neighborhoods.2That, in turn, influences U.S. generational wealth gaps. The average Black household in the United States owns only 15 to 20% as much net wealth as white Americans.3 This disparity is exacerbated by the fact that Black communities in the U.S. find it harder than white communities to access financial products, tools, services, and advice, according to the Global Financial Inclusion Index.There are, however, innovative efforts to build (or rebuild) support systems and affect positive change. For example, groups like 1863 Ventures, a national business development non-profit, received funding in 2022 from Principal® Foundation. The group, in turn, extended support to Black business owners like Kimberly Evans, who received a grant to build her venture, Just Her Rideshare. ""I wanted to build a community of women taking care of each other, but I'm also an entrepreneur,"" Evans says. ""I wanted to build something good but leave a legacy, too.""Creating those support systems doesn't start-or stop-with Black History Month, of course. Workplace education and planning can also help.At Principal, there is a February event, but there is also an employee resource group, created to support African American/Black employees, that meets year-round. Members network, learn at a monthly series, and connect outside work through community education, to name just a few. ""It's been impactful for me to see culture here at Principal being built with care and consideration for all people regardless of their backgrounds,"" Knox says.Turning vision into realityCommitting to opportunity for all can be meaningful and tied to business goals. ""It takes business leaders to sustain this work. Inclusion isn't a human resources initiative,"" says Miriam Lewis, chief inclusion officer at Principal. ""It's a business imperative."" To that end, in 2022 the Principal Foundation:joined other financial services companies to launch the NY Small Business Funders Collective to improve access to capital and technical assistance for people of color in New York City,awarded a grant to the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund to help entrepreneurs and small business owners improve their personal finances, andprovided programmatic funding to World Central Kitchen to support nutrition security and small business.Carter G. Woodson, the founder of what would become Black History Month, envisioned a future when the celebration would no longer be necessary.4 That world isn't there yet, but Black History Month offers an opportunity to look back and forward-and then act.And for some, his vision is reality.""In my eyes, every month is Black History Month. Every day I reflect on the many contributions and positive change that African Americans have made throughout time, including today,"" Knox says. ""It's important to maintain a sense of identity to remember where my ancestors came from-West Africa-and how, through their hard work, dedication, and beliefs, I have the opportunity to be where I am today.""Learn more about the commitment to inclusion at Principal.1ASALH 2Brookings 3Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System4ASALHReferenced companies are not affiliates of any member company of the Principal Financial Group® unless specifically noted.Principal® Global Financial Inclusion Index is a proprietary model output based upon certain assumptions that may change, are not guaranteed and should not be relied upon as a significant basis for an investment decision.Principal Financial Group Foundation, Inc.

287,9b88ccff-1a91-3abf-84a1-9fdf7be7194c,PFG,2023-02-18,3 Stocks to Sell Now According to Analysts,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-sell-now-according-194125755.html,1676403685,STORY,"['BBBY', 'PFG', 'RHI']","[Finding stocks to sell that analysts are pessimistic about is a tough one.That’s because analysts are in the business of making their investment banking clients (or potential clients) look good. Consequently, you’ll often see many investment firms with hold ratings on particular companies. Of course, that indicates a negative view of a stock, but they don’t want to jeopardize the business relationship.It’s called sitting on the fence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor this article, I’ve selected three stocks to sell from the S&amp;P Composite 1500, where at least 10 analysts have a rating on the stock, and at least half of the ratings are “underweight” or outright “sell.”If analysts are willing to go out on a limb for a given stock, it’s often because there’s no hope of getting any business from the company. It could also be that it’s transparently obvious that the company is of poor quality.Ultimately, however, and I fall into this camp, it’s much easier to stand behind a business than tear it down.Of the three names selected, one is clearly a dud. The other two’s low standing with analysts likely has more to do with the current economic environment than anything particularly negative about each’s business.Stocks to Sell: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)HDR image, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) retailer storefront entranceSource: QualityHD / Shutterstock.comPretty much the only person who made real money on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen. He made nearly $70 million on what many have described as an elaborate “pump-and-dump” scheme. On Feb. 10, the Ontario Superior Court granted Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Canada creditor protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Without support from its struggling U.S. operations, the Canadian division has been forced to liquidate its inventory. As a result, all 54 stores will close, putting 1,400 full- and part-time employees out of work.Yet Ryan Cohen, the so-called potential savior of BBBY and Gamestop (NYSE:GME), got even wealthier than he already was.Story continuesOf the 10 analysts that cover Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, eight either have it “underweight” or “sell” with an average target price of $1.64, 20% lower than where it’s currently trading. I have no idea how there could be any holds on this sickly stock, but that’s Wall Street for you.The company recently threw a Hail Mary by selling $225 million in convertible shares. It could raise an additional $800 million down the road from the issuance of warrants. But, as Michael Burry (The Big Short) has said, it’s now in a “death spiral.”It’s hard to call BBBY anything but a big SELL!Robert Half International (RHI)The Robert Half International (RHI) logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comOf the 14 analysts that cover Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI), seven either have it “underweight” or “sell” with an average target price of $73.64. That’s about 13% lower than where it’s currently trading. Since the global human resource staffing and consulting firm reported Q4 2022 results on Jan. 26, its stock gained about 4% of its value. The company delivered $1.37 a share, one penny better than the consensus analyst estimate, while it missed the revenue estimate by $10 million.CEO Keith Waddell said: “2022 was a very successful year across the entire Robert Half enterprise. We grew full-year revenues and earnings per share — both by more than 12 percent — and achieved new record levels for each,” Robert Half’s press release stated.The analyst per-share estimate for 2023 through 2025 is $4.84, $5.62, and $6.70, respectively, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8%. The revenue estimate for 2023 is 6.0% lower and 6.6% higher in 2024, with a three-year CAGR of 1.5%.The company says it’s “optimistic” about delivering in 2023, but the analysts aren’t convinced even though its valuation by most financial metrics is currently inexpensive.For example, its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $623 million [key ratios]. Based on a market capitalization of $9.1 billion, its free cash flow yield is 6.8%. I consider anything above 8% to be in value territory.Should a recession hit in the year’s second half, you can be sure that the demand for its services will fall off a cliff, most likely resulting in a cut in earnings estimates.Stocks to Sell: Principal Financial Group (PFG)In this photo illustration Principal Financial Group (PFG) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comA total of 17 analysts cover Principal Financial Group (NYSE:PFG). Of those analysts, nine have it as an outright “sell” with an average target price of $83.43, 10% lower than where it’s currently trading. The life and health insurance and wealth management company reported Q4 2022 results at the end of January. While they beat on top- and bottom-line estimates for the entire year, operating net income and revenues were down over 2021. Except for its U.S. Insurance Solutions business, its pre-tax operating earnings were down year-over-year.Like Robert Half, Principal CEO Dan Houston believes that the company made huge strides this past year in transforming its business to one that’s delivering higher growth with less risk attached to this growth.The analysts’ EPS estimates for the next three years are $6.99, $7.72, and $8.35. Based on $6.66 a share in 2022, its CAGR is expected to be 7.8%. That’s a respectable growth rate in my opinion.In December, Seeking Alpha reported that Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kligerman downgraded PFG stock to “neutral” from “outperform” on valuation concerns. At the time, it traded at 10.6x Credit Suisse’s 2023 EPS estimate compared to 8x for its financial services peers.Except for its valuation, Kligerman like’s the company’s focus on small- to medium-sized retirement and employee benefits businesses.Up 25% over the past year, PFG could be dead money for the next couple of quarters, maybe longer.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) share price is up 29% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 11%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Universal Health Services managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.1% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Universal Health Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Universal Health Services the TSR over the last 5 years was 32%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Universal Health Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 6%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Universal Health Services better, we need to consider many other factors.

293,d9d211f2-19ba-3c7f-8b93-07d7cca3168c,REGN,2023-02-18,Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-regn-risky-130013292.html,1676725213,STORY,['REGN'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Debt?As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$7.74b in cash, so it actually has US$5.76b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.14b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$3.41b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$7.74b as well as receivables valued at US$5.33b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$6.52b more liquid assets than total liabilities.This short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIn fact Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 44% in the last twelve months. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 68% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$5.76b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 68% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$3.4b. So we don't have any problem with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's use of debt. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders have bought shares recently.

294,33f003a7-9bb7-3803-9519-eaf309a924e3,UNP,2023-02-18,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-union-pacific-120041028.html,1676721641,STORY,['UNP'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.21bUS$6.39bUS$6.80bUS$7.40bUS$7.76bUS$8.06bUS$8.34bUS$8.59bUS$8.82bUS$9.05bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 4.79%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.40%Est @ 3.00%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$5.7kUS$5.4kUS$5.3kUS$5.3kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$143bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$143b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$63bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$113b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$202, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.085. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc. (NKE), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) and KLA Corporation (KLAC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NIKE shares were in line with the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+7.2% vs. +7.1%). The company reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results and provided an upbeat sales view. It reported the 10th and the fifth straight quarters of earnings and revenue beat, respectively. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.Its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses bode well. Our Model estimates 5.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2023, with 13.2% growth on a currency neutral basis.NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. The Zacks analyst expect soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Also, the new U.S. export regulations, supply-chain disruptions and mounting expenses remain overhangs.(You can read the full research report on KLA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Airbnb, Inc.
