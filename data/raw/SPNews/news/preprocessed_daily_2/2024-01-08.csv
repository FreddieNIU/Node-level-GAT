This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power.

However, we often fail to consider that most of the good stuff is already priced into widely dispensed assets. As such, I wanted to provide you with a list of stealth wealth stocks to consider going into 2024.', 'What do I mean by stealth wealth? I’m simply referring to under-the-radar stocks that possess significant value or growth prospects. Moreover, stealth assets are thinly traded, allowing investors to capture mispricing.', 'Despite the allure of stealth wealth investing, investors eventually catch onto these opportunities, leading to alpha decay. Therefore, it is critical to act quickly when spotting a stealth wealth opportunity.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With the aforementioned in mind, here are three overlooked stocks that could surge in 2024.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'U.S. Bancorp\xa0(NYSE:USB) is primed for gains in 2024. An implied U.S. interest rate pivot may lead to lower funding rates, concurrently assisting lenders such as U.S. Bancorp. Although many think lower interest rates will decrease banking profitability, a rise in credit spreads is common during the initial stages of interest rate tapers, lending bankers the necessary latitude to profit from a spread between borrowing and lending rates.', 'The bank’s latest fiscal report shows that approximately\xa060% of its revenue derives from interest-bearing activities. Moreover, commercial loans span about 35.6% of U.S. Bancorp’s lending mix. Therefore, it affirms the impact that a divergence between funding costs and lending rates might have in 2024. Additionally, 30.4% of U.S. Bancorp’s loan book is bound to mortgages. Sure, mortgage rates are decreasing. However, the bank could benefit from slightly lower mortgage rates as it will result in fewer late payments and defaults.', 'I selected USB stock as a stealth wealth asset because it is overlooked. USB stock’s average\xa0daily trading volume\xa0is merely 13.92% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s\xa0daily trading volume. Therefore, this suggests USB stock is thinly traded for a large-cap stock. Moreover, USB stock’s price-to-book ratio of 1.47x\xa0is below its 5-year average of 1.57x, communicating relative value. As if that isn’t enough to infer value, USB stock’s 4.42% dividend yield is best-in-class, adding substance to a total return argument.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Sibanye Stillwater\xa0(NYSE:SBSW) is a deep value play after suffering from various exogenous shocks that dragged its stock down by nearly 50% year-over-year (YOY). However, matters are looking up going into the new year.', 'The exogenous factors I alluded to earlier pertain to energy grid problems in South Africa, floods in Sibanye’s U.S.-based mines, broad-based labor strikes, and lower platinum group metals (PGMs) prices. Most of Sibanye’s exogenous issues have eased. For example, South African load-shedding hours have tapered while Sibanye’s U.S. mines are up and running again. Although labor strikes could remain an issue next year, PGM prices are set to rebound due to an incoming global interest rate pivot and a shortage of supply in the PGM arena.', 'Sibanye holds a number of catalysts that few investors are aware of. For one, the mining house has committed itself to the green economy via a series of recent acquisitions, including the Keliber lithium mining project and the\xa0Reldan recycling\xa0plant. Moreover, Sibanye’s ever-growing position in the platinum arena aligns it with sustained growth via a possible surge in green hydrogen uptake.', 'Although this is a risky bet, SBSW stock’s price-to-book ratio of 0.74x communicates deep value. More crucially, the company’s fundamentals are aligned, phasing out the possibility of a value trap.', 'Source: Vietnam stock photos / Shutterstock', 'Despite\xa0LVMH’s\xa0(OTCMKTS:LVMHF) stature as a brand, its stock has yet to gain significant traction in the United States. LVMH’s average daily volume stands at 2732, illustrating that it is a thinly traded security. Thin trading often leads to mispricing, which is exactly what I see in LVMH stock.', 'I recognize that many are concerned by the economic cycle and its potential effects on\xa0retail stocks\xa0in 2024. However, LVMH is what’s called a Veblen goods retailer. In simpler terms, its presence as a luxury retailer is noncyclical due to its end market possessing the necessary balance sheets to spend throughout the economic cycle. As such, LVMH is unlikely to be influenced by top-down variables for now.', 'LVMH sports solid bottom-up characteristics. The firm’s latest 9-month revenue figures were released in October, wherein LVMH revealed\xa014% YOY growth in sales. Most of LVMH’s revenue growth stemmed from selective retailing, as segmental revenue surged by 26% YOY. Furthermore, LVMH’s fashion and leather goods segment sales concurrently increased by 16%, while its watch and jewelry segment gained by 9%. Although LVMH’s spirit sales slumped by 7% YOY, I expect holistic growth to be sustained in 2024, with momentum from Asia being a significant benefactor.', 'Key metrics imply that LVMH stock provides high-quality value. For instance, LVMH’s return on common equity of 29.56%\xa0is accompanied by a modest\xa0price-to-sales ratio of 4.39x. Even though LVMH stock isn’t known for illustrious gains, key metrics show that overlooked value is in store.', 'On the date of publication, Steve Booyens held an indirect long position in\xa0SBSW.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Gartner (NYSE:IT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Gartner with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Gartner ', ""Gartner has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. To the delight of shareholders, Gartner's EPS soared from US$9.39 to US$11.94, over the last year. That's a commendable gain of 27%."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Gartner remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to US$5.8b.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.0b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!"", ""For growth investors, Gartner's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. What about risks?

You also don't have to take on a lot of risk to earn a higher return.

The utility anticipates growing its dividend at around that same rate. That sets the stage for the company to deliver 9%-11% average annual total returns in the coming years.

It owns a portfolio of boring assets, including electric utilities, toll roads, pipelines, ports, and cell towers.

It retains the rest to help fund expansion projects. Brookfield ended last year with about $6.7 billion of projects it expects to fund over the next two to three years. The most notable project is its investment to help finance the construction of two semiconductor manufacturing plants with Intel.', 'Brookfield estimates that reinvesting its retained cash flow into those projects will grow its funds from operations by 2%-3% per year. On top of that, the company should get a 3%-4% annual cash-flow boost from inflation-linked rate increases in its contracts and another 1%-2% bump from volume growth as the global economy expands. That sets it up to organically grow its cash flow by 6%-9% per year, supporting its plan to increase its dividend by 5%-9% annually.', 'Brookfield also routinely sells mature assets and recycles that capital into higher-return opportunities. This strategy has helped boost its growth rate to more than 10% annually over the past decade, a pace it expects to maintain for at least the next few years. Add its high-yielding dividend, and Brookfield could produce total annual returns in the low teens.', ""Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT). While real estate can be an exciting investment, Realty Income invests in boring, single-tenant, net lease properties. Most of its portfolio comprises retail properties (grocery, convenience, dollar, and drugstores) or industrial buildings (warehouses). The company's net leases provide it with a remarkably stable rental income that increases each year (either at a fixed rate or one linked to inflation)."", 'The REIT pays out about 75% of its cash flow to investors each month in dividends (currently yielding 5.3%). It retains the rest to help fund new income-generating property investments. Realty Income anticipates that both rent growth and property acquisitions will increase its cash flow per share by 4%-5% annually.', ""That should enable it to continue increasing its dividend (something it has done 123 times since its public market listing in 1994). With that payout already yielding more than 5% and its earnings expected to rise by up to 5% each year, Realty Income's total return should approach 10% annually."", 'American Water Works, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Realty Income have boring business models that generate very stable cash flow.

The Hang Seng Tech Index experienced a significant decline of up to 3.5%, pointing towards the possibility of its lowest closing level since November 2022. Among the notable contributors to the negative trend in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index were major Chinese tech companies, including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd., and Meituan.

BOOT is the largest retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories in the U.S. They believe that they have a $40 billion addressable market, and they focus their marketing and sales effort on four customer segments: work, western, country, and fashion (the smallest segment). The majority of their sales are for work-related products, which we believe will hold up relatively well even through a downturn. With 356 stores in 41 states, they are more than three times the size of their next largest competitor (in terms of store count), and because of their scale, we believe Boot Barn can offer competitive pricing and a very broad selection with good availability for customers – so in terms of niche dominance, BOOT is the biggest player in a fragmented industry with strong and growing margins and significant brand loyalty. A notable part of our investment thesis is confidence in their ability to grow. We see a path from 356 stores (currently) to 900 stores over the next 7-10 years by growing their store count more than 10% annually – a level this team has shown the capacity to achieve over a number of years. As you may remember, we owned Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) for many years and see a lot of similarities in these businesses and their footprint/target customers. TSCO has more than 2000 stores and is one data point that suggests BOOT has a long runway for growth.', 'As you know, a company’s financial flexibility is also very important to us; BOOT has a solid balance sheet and currently has more cash than long-term debt. We believe they can fund the opening of new stores with internally-generated cash flow and project that the investment in each new store should pay back in less than two years. Over the past six months, our team has met with the CEO and the rest of the management team multiple times, and we have learned a lot about their customers, real estate, pricing and retail strategies, competition, and corporate culture. We have gained confidence that their leadership is focused on the right initiatives: 1) expanding their store base; 2) driving same store sales growth; 3) continuing their omni-channel leadership; and 4) building out their higher margin exclusive brands. They have taken their exclusive brands from 16% in 2019 to 34% of overall sales in the most recent trailing twelve months with more room for growth over time.

In fact, even companies with expensive valuations relative to their trailing earnings can end up being a better value if earnings outpace the stock price growth rate.', ""Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) aren't cheap stocks by any means. But they all have clear paths toward growing earnings years to come. Three Motley Fool contributors were asked to offer more detail on why each of these growth stocks is worth buying in 2024. Here's what they had to say."", ""Lee Samaha (Tesla): Companies behave differently according to their end market conditions, and that's undoubtedly the case in the auto market. Whereas the electric vehicle (EV) market is high growth, the internal combustion engine (ICE) market is not. Tesla is in the electric vehicle (EV) market; in fact, it's the market leader in the EV market by some distance. That means it must behave like a growth company and not like a traditional ICE vehicle manufacturer dealing with low-single-digit growth end markets and fighting to preserve every bit of its profit margin."", ""I'm belaboring the point to illustrate that Tesla's strategy of lowering prices (keeping its cars affordable as interest rate increases push up customers' monthly payments) is correct. It's not what a traditional automaker might do, but they are not generating the bulk of their sales in high-growth markets where early leadership is everything."", ""The strategy has cost Tesla some margin this year, but it's helped maintain Tesla's leadership in the market and kept its production plans on track."", 'The latter is crucial because it allows Tesla to invest in technological improvements and factory extensions that ultimately lower its cost per unit vehicle. Finally, this should pay off by enabling Tesla to offer more affordable cars in the future, maintain market share, and increase profit margin and profits.', 'Some of these things could come through in 2024 if interest rates move lower, giving Tesla more opportunity to raise prices.', ""Scott Levine (Microsoft): Are you among the millions who have started using OpenAI's ChatGPT to help with work tasks? Maybe you're one of the people who are testing its creative capabilities and having it compose Shakespearean sonnets for your loved ones. This past year has seen a titanic shift in the public's attention toward artificial intelligence (AI), and there's no denying how profound an effect AI will have in numerous facets of our lives from now on."", ""This interest from the public in the new potentials of AI is a big part of why investor interest in AI stocks like Microsoft has soared over the past year. And for those who feel like they've missed the AI boat, picking up shares of Microsoft continues to be a smart move for AI-focused investors."", ""Microsoft may have gained prominence with its word processing and spreadsheet offerings, but these days it's also committed to advancing AI.

Soon Microsoft expects Copilot to use leading AI models like GPT-4 Turbo and Dall-E 3. And it's available to the masses. In addition to Alphabet's Google Play Store, the Copilot App can now be downloaded from the Apple App Store."", 'Illustrating Microsoft\'s commitment to AI, CEO Satya Nadella stated on the company\'s first-quarter 2024 conference call that Microsoft is ""rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role of business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.""

But Enphase's slowdown illustrates just how impactful high interest rates were on the residential solar industry. Management's commentary on the company's last earnings call was fairly bleak when looking toward the near-term results. The good news is that Enphase expects things to begin turning around in the second half of 2024, which points to a rosy outlook for 2025."", 'The painful reality is that Enphase is an interest rate story. Many of its customers depend on financing projects with a low interest rate. Enphase itself benefits from a lower cost of capital to fuel its growth. Enphase also depends on a strong economy and excitement in the energy transition. This is all to say that banking on a quick turnaround is a bad idea.', 'Enphase rallied at the end of 2023 because it was oversold, not because the fundamentals have improved. Still, the worst of the sell-off should be in the past. Enphase already guided for a terrible Q4 2023, with revenue growth expected to be just $300 million to $350 million, compared to $724.7 million in Q4 2022.', ""The real question is how the first half of 2024 will play out. If the cycle rebounds faster than expected, Enphase stock could be teed up for an excellent year. But if Q1 and Q2 show decelerations similar to what we expect from Q4 2022, and then Enphase doesn't see the turnaround it was initially anticipating in the second half of 2024, impatient investors may decide to give up on the stock and smash the sell button."", 'The best way to approach a stock like Enphase is to focus on the long-term potential without losing sight of what could move the stock in the short term. Poor performance and guidance, paired with an industry-wide slowdown, wreaked havoc on Enphase in the first 10 months of last year. A widespread market rally and the prospect of lower interest rates made Enphase one of the best performers in the whole market in the last two months of the year.', 'Investors with a high risk tolerance could consider buying Enphase now.

As the S&P 500 index rose by more than 24% over the year, Realty Income's share price slumped by 9%."", ""On the face of it, there wasn't much reason for the market to shun the stock. Fueled by its strong portfolio, plus acquisitions both of fellow REITs and attractive retail properties individually, Realty Income showed notable growth in key metrics throughout 2023."", ""The company's third quarter was typically strong, with its adjusted funds from operations -- the most important profitability line item for REITs -- leaping nearly 20% higher year over year."", 'But investors were worried about the state of the global and domestic economy throughout 2023. If they held assets in companies dependent on debt financing, they were particularly worried. While the feverish, inflation-fighting central bank rate hikes are quickly becoming a thing of the past, they are still high relative to the microscopic levels of the pre-pandemic years.', 'No matter how successful or struggling, nearly all REITs (and most large-scale buyers and developers of real estate, come to think of it) need debt financing. Purchasing and developing buildings is a ferociously expensive job, and can quickly drain capital if not done with good strategy and care. Those lofty rates were spooking potential REIT investors, and many remain skittish.', 'The good news is that, at least in the U.S., interest rates look very likely to get a few haircuts next year. The Federal Reserve has stated that it intends to do some chopping, following notable declines in several recent inflation data sets.', ""Even without such an assist from the Fed, Realty Income will grow ever larger. At the end of October it announced yet another big-ticket acquisition, the $9.3 billion deal\xa0for peer REIT Spirit Realty Capital. This buy has several very attractive aspects for Realty Income shareholders, not least that it's being paid for entirely in stock (as opposed to precious capital)."", ""Despite its good fundamental performance, 2023 wasn't Realty Income's year.

Tools that allow organizations to stream their data in real time are unlocking more robust analytics and nimbleness versus legacy batch reporting that may be too little or too late with insights.', ""According to Gartner, the market Confluent is serving will grow from an already robust $60 billion in 2022 to $100 billion in 2025, and keep growing from there. Confluent was literally built for this transition, founded by the creators of the de facto industry standard open-source streaming tool, Apache Kafka. Confluent went public in 2021, leveraging the euphoric initial public offering (IPO) market to raise significant capital to supercharge its growth. That's paid off over the past few years, with the company's revenue more than tripling since 2021, while gross margin has grown even faster:"", ""But like other software-as-a-service (SaaS) start-ups, it's been a cash-burning machine, sending the stock down by half since its debut and more than 75% from the high:"", ""But like its customers making the transition to data streaming, Confluent is shifting from money burner to cash cow. After free-cash-flow burn increased every year since the company's IPO, that number began shrinking two quarters ago, and management is now guiding to be cash-flow-neutral in 2024. Based on that trajectory, investors should expect to see Confluent start gushing cash in the years to follow."", 'With $1.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a massive, growing, high-margin market to take share from, Confluent is set to win in 2024 and beyond.', 'Chuck Saletta (Microsoft): In a late 2023 poll conducted by ResumeBuilder, just over half of responding companies indicated that they were already using artificial intelligence (AI) in their businesses. And of those that did, over a third used their AI to replace workers. That same survey indicates that in 2024, nearly 80% of those companies will be using AI, and almost half of them think AI will lead to even more layoffs this year.', ""OpenAI's ChatGPT was the AI launch with the biggest public splash, and Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI certainly sets it up to be an early mover in the generative/language-based AI space. That said, while ChatGPT may be getting a bunch of the press, Microsoft's AI work is clearly taking root beyond just that specific implementation."", ""In particular, Microsoft's recently released Copilot system is designed to enable a fairly seamless tie-in of multiple types of AI services and solutions. That integrated, end-to-end approach gives the company a great opportunity to really help multiply the impact that a smaller number of AI-enabled employees can drive."", 'One of the limitations with traditional AI solutions is that they tend to do one thing -- whatever it is they\'re trained for -- really well. They tend to fail miserably at other tasks, and if later trained for those other tasks, they then ""forget"" what it was that they had originally been trained on. That often leads to AI, no matter how good it can be, getting used primarily for limited and well-defined roles.', 'With Copilot, Microsoft appears to be tying together multiple different AI models under one interface, thus sidestepping that ""forgetfulness"" problem. Rather than trying to have one model do it all, Copilot makes it easier to use the right model for the job, with the behind-the-scenes complexity of the multiple models more or less hidden.', ""Unless and until a general purpose artificial intelligence becomes a reality, Microsoft's Copilot approach might very well be the best way to drive the sort of major office productivity that companies expect. If AI-driven layoffs become as widespread as ResumeBuilder's survey thinks they might, it makes sense to consider an investment in a business that stands to profit from that trend."", 'Whether or not Realty Income, Confluent, or Microsoft make the cut to deserve a spot in your portfolio, now is the time to consider what you think the big drivers of 2024 will be.

(NYSE:LUV). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Southwest Airlines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ', ""According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 34.96x is currently well-above the industry average of 10.49x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Southwest Airlines’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Southwest Airlines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? LUV’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe LUV should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LUV for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for LUV, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""If you want to dive deeper into Southwest Airlines, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

You’re excited about adding passive income to your portfolio, only to read about company after company that pays a dividend yield of 1%. Like, seriously – you would need a boatload of shares to see substance from such a lowly yield.', 'Rest assured, I’m not going to do you like that. Instead, every one of these dividend stocks to watch features a forward yield of at least 4% at time of writing. What’s more, the underlying fundamentals justify the generous payout. In other words, I’m not going the other extreme, feeding you a bunch of junk with unsustainable yields.', 'So, if you’ve already identified your growth plays and are seeking relevant, high-yielding enterprises, you’ve come to the right place.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'To be quite blunt, legacy technology juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t get much love. It’s completely understandable. In the hip innovation sector, Big Blue comes off as the “okay boomer” play of the ecosystem. I mean, the company first originated in June of 1911. I dare say we don’t have too many folks walking among us that were around when IBM made its corporate debut.', 'Set aside preconceived notions, though, and I think you’ll find that it’s one of the dividend stocks to watch. For one thing, IBM put up an intriguing performance. No, 15.5% up in 2023 is hardly impressive when the benchmark equities index is smoking you. But look at the second-half performance of 22.2% up; that’s better than – shock! – Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which gained only 17% during this period.', 'No, before you fire up an angry email, I’m not comparing the two. But here’s the thing. IBM has been doing artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long time. It deserves more respect than it’s getting. Of course, the forward yield of 4.06% is quite enticing. In my opinion, it’s easily one of the dividend stocks to watch.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'A pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a relevant platform for dividend stocks to watch. At a cynical level, no matter what happens in the economy, society will always have a need for advanced therapeutics. Therefore, I view the red ink in ABBV – it lost almost 5% in 2023 – as a contrarian opportunity. Indeed, in the past six months, shares gained 15%, suggesting a possible comeback in 2024.', 'But I’m more looking forward to 2025 and many, many years beyond that. Earlier, AbbVie acquired Allergan and in doing so, it took over the Botox neurotoxic protein. As you know, people undergo Botox injections for anti-wrinkle solutions. But here’s something I didn’t know. Many folks also use Botox as a preventative treatment; that is, it may be better to start treatment at a younger age to extend a youthful appearance.', 'I believe that’s a huge catalyst for ABBV considering that millennials and Generation Z – the social-media-obsessed cohorts – are intensely focused on their physical appearance. It’s cynical but that makes AbbVie’s forward dividend yield of 4% all the more credible. I’m a fan.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'Easily the most controversial idea for dividend stocks to watch on this list, if you’re ideologically agnostic, then Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) deserves a long look. At first glance, the tobacco giant seems completely anachronistic. Let’s face it. In many parts of the world, government agencies have cracked down on public areas where smoking was previously allowed. Sports organizations have heavily discouraged tobacco advertising.', 'So, is that the gallows for the tobacco stalwart? Hardly. While “analog” smoking may be fading away in several western nations, “digital” smoking is on the rise.

Further, this sector may expand at a blistering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.6% to 2030. At the forecast culmination point, the market could post revenue of $182.84 billion.', 'You know what’s really off the charts? Government agencies worldwide may eventually ban flavored e-cigarettes, which is the domain of small business.

In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$61.7, the company appears about fair value at a 2.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$2.5 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$63.0', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Public Service Enterprise Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is well covered by earnings.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Dividends are not covered by cash flow.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 4 years.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

And February, with a 3% average advance, is even better.', 'Despite those promising signs, a net 26% of European fund managers were underweight basic resources shares, Bank of America’s investor survey found in December, the most unloved sector after chemicals. Their wariness likely stems from fears of an economic downturn, as well as uncertainty on how much stimulus China will deploy to support growth in the world’s largest steelmaking nation.', 'Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina notes that US rate-cut prospects, falling Treasury yields and a weaker dollar all tend to act as buy signals for mining shares.

That in turn should underpin earnings momentum for related equities through the first quarter and possibly the second one, they reckon.', 'Morgan Stanley analysts led by Alain Gabriel expect a wider dispersion in shareholder returns from the mining sector this year, given uncertainty around Chinese policy, interest rates and the potential reversal in the dollar.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) which saw its share price drive 131% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 11% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.5% in 90 days)."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis ', ""While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", ""During five years of share price growth, Zoetis achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 18% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", 'We know that Zoetis has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 139% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""It's good to see that Zoetis has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 34% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 19% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Zoetis   you should know about."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The S&P 500 rallied more than 24% and closed near its all-time high. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up even more. ', 'However, there were some notable underperformers in 2023. Dividend stocks, in particular, were weaker last year, weighed down by rising interest rates and other issues. ', 'That trend could reverse in 2024, powering rebound years for many dividend stocks. NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP), and NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as those that could soar in 2024. ', ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (NextEra Energy): There was a big reveal from NextEra Energy in 2023. In late September, the utility company announced that distribution growth at its controlled master limited partnership (MLP), NextEra Energy Partners, would be cut in half. Rising interest rates and a steep decline in the MLP's share price as investors soured on clean energy assets were key trouble spots. Essentially, the MLP's prospects aren't nearly as rosy as they once were."", ""Given that NextEra Energy's business is broken down into 70% regulated utility and 30% clean energy investments, it makes sense that Wall Street's thoughts turned even more negative than they had been. Although there was a bounce in NextEra Energy's stock during the end-of-year rally, it still lost more than 25% in 2023. But here's the interesting thing about that September update: NextEra Energy reiterated its expectations for its own earnings to increase between 6% and 8% a year through 2026 and for dividend growth to be 10% a year through at least 2024."", ""Basically, NextEra Energy is cognizant of the troubles in the clean energy space, but isn't particularly worried about the impact it will have on its own business. Being one of the largest regulated utility companies in the United States, the company has ample access to capital and a strong foundation. As 2024 progresses and investors grow more comfortable with NextEra Energy's still-robust outlook, it is highly likely this dividend growth stock will continue to recover. And, in the meantime, investors can collect the 3% dividend yield, which remains near its highest levels over the past decade."", ""Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Infrastructure): Shares of Brookfield Infrastructure fell 9.3% in 2023. The main factor weighing on the stock was rising interest rates. That's largely because Brookfield pays a higher dividend yield (currently 4.3%). Its shares were less attractive to income-focused investors since they had plenty of other options with even lower risk profiles, like bank CDs and government bonds. "", 'However, interest rates should shift from being a headwind to a tailwind in 2024. The Federal Reserve hinted last month that it plans to cut them a few times this year. Brookfield will become more attractive to income-seeking investors as rates fall, which should boost its share price. ', ""Rates aren't the only catalyst for Brookfield Infrastructure. The company's growth rate should accelerate in the coming quarters, powered by recent acquisitions. While its funds from operations (FFO) were up a solid 7% in the third quarter (driven by higher tariffs across its existing businesses and completing $1 billion in expansion projects), those results didn't reflect recent acquisitions. Furthermore, they were dragged down by $2 billion in asset sales that closed in Q2. It's using those sales to fund four new investments that closed over the past quarter (three data center investments and a leading global container leasing company). "", 'Those deals should have given Brookfield the fuel to deliver double-digit FFO-per-share growth last year. Meanwhile, they give Brookfield lots of momentum heading into 2024, when it could once again achieve a double-digit earnings growth rate. ', ""The company's rising earnings should give it the fuel to continue increasing its dividend. It's targeting to grow its already high-yielding payout by 5% to 9% per year. That will make its dividend even more attractive as rates fall, which could help its stock bounce back sharply in 2024. "", ""Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy Partners): Given how steadily NextEra Energy Partners was growing its cash flows and dividends, not many expected the renewable energy stock to plunge 58% in 2023. However, barely a month after projecting 12% to 15% growth in annual dividends through 2026, NextEra Energy Partners slashed its target to only 5% to 8% in September as higher interest rates made funding for growth and dividends costlier for the company. Unsurprisingly, investors who banked on the stock's dividend stability were quick to dump it. The shares now yield a hefty 11.3%."", ""For income investors, though, NextEra Energy Partners stock still has much to offer and there's a solid chance it could rebound in 2024. That's because the company is already working on a turnaround plan, and its parent NextEra Energy is keen to make it a success."", 'Under its revitalization plan, NextEra Energy Partners will primarily rely on organic growth to generate cash flows. Specifically, it will repower nearly 1.3 gigawatts of its existing wind projects in the near term. Meanwhile, the company will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire renewable energy assets from its parent or third parties. NextEra Energy Partners also recently sold a portion of its natural gas assets and has some more to go.', ""NextEra Energy Partners believes all of these moves combined should generate enough cash flow so that the company can fund its dividend and won't have to issue new shares to raise fresh capital until 2027. Its current dividend growth goal of 5% to 8%, with a target of a 6% boost per year, is also comparable to peers and therefore looks sustainable. With interest rates also expected to cool down, NextEra Energy Partners looks like a great dividend stock to own for 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

Site activations are expected to continue throughout 2024 with a target of activating approximately 80 centers in the U.S. and Europe. The study will randomize approximately 500 patients 1:1 to AVIM therapy combined with continued medical therapy (treatment) or continued medical therapy and standard pacing alone (control). The study’s primary efficacy endpoint will determine at three months post-randomization whether AVIM-treated patients experience a statistically significant reduction in daily average blood pressure (mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure or “aSBP”) as compared to control patients. The primary safety endpoint will determine at three months post-randomization whether AVIM-treated patients experience serious adverse device effects that are not anticipated with cardiac pacing.

HTN accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis and leads to increased risk of major cardiac events like heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease and other end organ damage. HTN is the leading global risk factor for death, affecting an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide. In the United States, 122 million adults, or approximately 47% of all adults, are estimated to have HTN. While many patients do not notice high blood pressure, cardiovascular risk doubles for every 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and the mortality rate doubles with an increase of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure.2', 'It is estimated that more than 70% of the approximately 1.1 million people globally who are implanted with cardiac pacemakers each year are also diagnosed with HTN. Based on updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, an even higher percentage (approximately 80%) of U.S. patients that are indicated for the implant of a pacemaker have HTN. Pacemaker patients tend to be elderly and are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and harder to treat effectively with medical therapy for many reasons including co-morbidities and a high prevalence of isolated systolic HTN.', 'About AVIM Therapy (BackBeat CNT™)', 'AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure.

None of the 171 passengers or six crew were seriously injured but the rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said the two seats next to the part that tore off were unoccupied.', 'HOW ARE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING?', 'The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of some Boeing Max 9 operated by U.S. airlines or flown into the country by foreign carriers until they are inspected. The emergency order affects about 171 planes worldwide.', 'The NTSB has begun an investigation that is likely to last months and focus on the paneled-over exit door that blew off. The so-called door plug is installed on some jets that have fewer seats instead of an emergency exit panel. The jets ordered grounded by the FAA all have those panels installed.', 'Investigators said Sunday they had found the door plug, and hoped it would provide physical evidence of what went wrong.', 'HOW ARE AIRLINES RESPONDING?', 'Alaska Airlines has grounded its entire fleet of 65 Max 9s for inspections and maintenance. The airline initially kept 18 of its Max 9s in service Saturday because they had received in-depth inspections as part of recent maintenance checks. But the airline pulled those jets from service Saturday night to comply with an FAA directive for all operators of Max 9s to conduct specific inspections.', 'United Airlines, the world’s biggest operator of Max 9s, grounded its entire fleet of 79 Max 9s and is seeking to “clarify the inspection process and requirements for returning” them to service.', 'Alaska and United, the only two U.S. passenger airlines that operate Max 9 aircraft, have canceled hundreds of flights since Saturday due to the Max 9 groundings.', ""The companies operate nearly two-thirds of the 215 Max 9 aircraft in service around the world, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Six other airlines use the Max 9: Panama's Copa Airlines, Aeromexico, Turkish airlines, Icelandair, flydubai, and SCAT Airlines in Kazakhstan, according to Cirium."", ""Copa said it had temporarily suspended 21 Boeing 737 Max 9s to comply with the FAA's order. Turkish Airlines said it pulled its five Max 9s from service."", 'HOW SAFE IS IT TO FLY ON ONE OF THESE PLANES?', 'Federal officials and airline executives regularly tout the safety of air travel. There has not been a fatal crash of a U.S. airliner since 2009, when a Colgan Air plane operated for Continental crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground. However, a surge in close calls between planes at U.S. airports in the past year prompted the FAA to convene a “safety summit” last year, in which officials encouraged airlines and pilots to redouble their attention to careful flying.', ""The incident has also renewed questions about the safety of Boeing's Max aircraft, which the newest version of the company's storied 737. There are two versions of the aircraft in service: the Max 8 and the Max 9, which is the larger of the two."", 'Regulators around the world grounded Max 8 planes for nearly two years after a Lion Air flight crashed in Indonesia in 2018, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed in 2019. Boeing changed an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.', 'Last year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane. And in December, Boeing told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.', ""However, those past issues are unrelated to Friday's blowout, which is an exceedingly rare event in air travel."", ""Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said it's too soon to say whether the blowout involved an issue with Max 9s or that specific flight. Brickhouse said passengers should feel confident that regulators and airlines will make sure the grounded Max 9s are safe before returning them to service."", ""Brickhouse said it was lucky that the emergency occurred shortly after takeoff when passengers were all seated with their seatbelts on. But he said that doesn't mean passengers should feel scared to leave their seats once the pilot turns off the “fasten seatbelt” sign because it's so unlikely for holes to open in the fuselages of airliners."", 'In 1988, a flight attendant for Aloha Airlines was blown out of the cabin of a Boeing 737 over the Pacific Ocean after an 18-foot-long chunk of the roof peeled away. Metal fatigue was blamed in that case, which led to tougher rules for airlines to inspect and repair microscopic fuselage cracks.', '“When passengers board a flight they should feel confident that the aircraft they are flying on is safe,” Brickhouse said.', 'In 2018, a passenger on a Southwest Airlines jet was killed in when a piece of engine housing blew off and shattered the window she was sitting next to. That incident involved an earlier version of the Boeing 737, not a Max.', ""WHAT IS BOEING'S RESPONSE?"", 'Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun called a companywide webcast to talk about the incident with employees and senior leadership for Tuesday.', '“When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don’t happen again,” Calhoun wrote in a message to employees Sunday. “This is and must be the focus of our team right now.”', 'The company, based in Arlington, Virginia, also has said it supported the FAA’s decision to require immediate inspections and said it was providing technical help to the investigators.']"

That in turn should underpin earnings momentum for related equities through the first quarter and possibly the second one, they reckon.', 'Morgan Stanley analysts led by Alain Gabriel expect a wider dispersion in shareholder returns from the mining sector this year, given uncertainty around Chinese policy, interest rates and the potential reversal in the dollar. Highlighting rising supply stresses in copper markets, they are tactically bullish on producers such as Lundin and Antofagasta.', 'Finally, valuation could prove a headwind for mining stocks. Their recent bounce has taken forward P/E ratios to about 11, back to long-term averages, while the discount to the broader market has narrowed to 12%.

The electronics market has not only grasped the relevance of this technology for current applications but also for the exponential impacts that can be garnered in future technological progress. It is expected that the AI demand would increase by about 40% in the course of five years. Hence, it is not surprising that various electronic companies are continuously upgrading their products and investments in the arena. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), have already infiltrated the generative AL software market with powerful computer chips like H100 and MI300X respectively, Intel (NASDAQ: INTL) has also ventured forth with new chips including Gaudi3.', 'Similarly, IBM (NYSE: IBM) are also in touch with the necessity of upgrading their AI systems. To this end, only this year they have a new data science platform- Watsonx. It is supposed to provide tools for building and organizing AI and arranging all data sources under one platform.', 'As evidenced in almost all industries, the COVID-19 pandemic had volatile repercussions for consumers and businesses alike. The electronics industry was, thus one of the victims. Lock-downs and closures negatively impacted electronics sales. However, the work from home trend led to a reversal of the situations, increasing demand for items like computers etc.', 'In 2022, the global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion and it is predicted that this figure would change to $1,239.40 billion by the end of 2030.

Rather, the latest announcement involves Intel's in-house generative AI software business, which is now being christened Articul8 AI."", 'With some outside investment help from data center, cell tower, and internet infrastructure manager DigitalBridge Group, as well as a consortium of other investment firms, Intel has spun off Articul8 AI as a separate company.', ""Of course, Intel did announce a slew of new chips aimed at various AI applications in December. The company is also receiving the first of a new batch of advanced machines from top semiconductor manufacturing equipment company ASML Holding, which will be critical to Intel's roadmap of new chips in the coming years."", ""But why separate the AI software business, especially when Nvidia -- the dominant player in AI training chips -- has built its technological lead with a combination of hardware and software? And does Intel's move to set Articul8 free make it a good investment for 2024?"", ""Perhaps Intel's release of Articul8 AI sounds familiar. Under the guidance of CEO Pat Gelsinger the last few years, Intel has been closing down non-strategic business lines and selling equity stakes in others to outside investors."", 'For example, in late 2022, Intel sold a small stake in its autonomous vehicle chip segment Mobileye, relisting the stock on public exchanges after it acquired it back in early 2018. It retains majority ownership of Mobileye at this point.', 'Something similar was accomplished with the sale of another subsidiary business, IMS Nanofabrication, over the summer of 2023. IMS makes the equipment used to fabricate key components (called photomasks) used in advanced ASML lithography machines (more on that in a moment). Intel sold a 20% stake in IMS to private equity company Bain Capital, and a couple of months later, another 10% stake in IMS to fellow chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (or simply TSMC), the leading chip manufacturer Intel is trying to chase down.', 'Most recently, Intel said it would be spinning off its programmable chip business within the next few years. This programmable chip unit, which specializes in a semiconductor type called FPGAs, was assembled primarily via the mega-acquisition of Altera back in 2015.', ""It's clear Gelsinger and the top team at Intel want to raise cash. But this isn't just the simple disassembly of the Intel semiconductor empire. Gelsinger has been clear he wants to return Intel to chip manufacturing greatness. TSMC passed Intel's chip manufacturing technology capabilities a few years ago, and soon after surpassed Intel in terms of overall revenue."", ""The problem, in the eyes of many both inside and outside the semiconductor industry, is that TSMC poses supply chain and geopolitical risks -- owing to China's overtures toward reunifying the island of Taiwan with the rest of the country. Intel sees an opportunity to position its vast manufacturing capabilities, historically reserved for its own chip designs, as an alternative third-party contract manufacturer to TSMC."", 'A long list of fabless (no chipmaking, just engineering) semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, might be interested in diversifying their chip supply chain if Intel can accommodate.', ""But therein lies the rub. Intel can't just simply decide to compete with TSMC's manufacturing prowess. It needs to purchase that capability. That's where ASML's lithography equipment, as well as other chip manufacturing equipment suppliers, come in. And ASML's latest-and-greatest, its High-NA EUV lithography machines, don't come cheap. These marvels of industrial technology cost upwards of $400 million each, plus ample ongoing operating expenses thereafter."", ""Suffice to say, Intel is in need of a lot of cash it doesn't currently have on balance if it wants to retake the chip manufacturing technology crown from TSMC. As I wrote in November, Intel's free cash flow was deeply negative in 2023, and it has far more debt than cash on balance."", 'And what is it up against? Heavy spending (in this case, capital expenditures on property and equipment) from highly profitable TSMC as it tries to maintain its leadership in chipmaking. So Intel has quite a ways to go to narrow the gap.', 'And this is likely why Intel just announced another spinoff of one of its non-core assets, Articul8 AI. Intel gets to retain some ownership in the now-independent software company, which it will help with go-to-market strategies for the budding generative AI industry. But in the meantime, Intel also raised some cash for what is sure to be an expensive manufacturing journey in the coming years.', 'So does this most recent sale make Intel a buy? Perhaps, for the right investor. Just know the risk. Intel has lined up a steady stream of liquidity it can tap into in the coming years with all of these business sales to outside investors. Now it comes down to whether Intel can execute -- and it will be difficult, given that the complexity of crafting next-gen chips is only rising.', 'I still count Intel as a higher-risk and only potentially higher-reward semiconductor rebound story at this juncture. There are other chip stocks with better risk-to-reward profiles out there right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.', 'Although the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the ""Magnificent Seven"" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher.', ""When I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:"", 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', 'Apple clocked in as the ""worst"" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively.', 'What investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.', ""Apple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies."", ""Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending."", ""Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month."", ""Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter."", 'Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024.', 'Meta Platforms owns the world\'s top social media ""real estate."" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users.', ""Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability."", ""In spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check."", 'Among the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.', 'The biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.', 'But there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.', ""Secondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line."", ""What can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS."", ""As noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it."", ""Don't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years)."", ""Although some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach."", ""Throughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997."", 'On the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.', ""I'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come."", ""So, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind."", ""In Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power."", ""Through the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin."", ""To build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power."", ""Regulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product."", ""Lastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Helmerich & Payne's  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich & Payne ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Helmerich & Payne is:', '16% = US$434m ÷ US$2.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability.

This probably laid the ground for Helmerich & Payne's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Helmerich & Payne's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 23% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. "", ""In Helmerich & Payne's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 24% (or a retention ratio of 76%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business."", ""Additionally, Helmerich & Payne has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 53% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 9.3%, over the same period."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Helmerich & Payne's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings.

The safest dividend stocks can raise their dividends each year, even during recessions.', 'The following three dividend stocks have low dividend payout ratios and recession-proof business models, meaning their dividends are well-covered even during a recession.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock', 'Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) was founded in 1891 in Minnesota. Since that time, the company has grown into a giant in the food products industry with over $12 billion in annual revenue. Hormel has kept its core competency as a processor of meat products for well over a hundred years but has also grown into other business lines through acquisitions. The company sells its products in 80 countries worldwide, and its brands include Skippy, Spam, Applegate, Justin’s and more than 30 others.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Hormel posted fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Nov. 29, 2023, and results were weaker than expected on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came to 42 cents, missing estimates fairly widely by 3 cents, or about 7%. Revenue also fell 2.6% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, missing estimates by $70 million, or roughly 2%. Adjusted operating income came to $313 million, or 9.8% of revenue. Adjusted before-tax operating earnings came to $289 million. Cash flow from operations came to $319 million.', 'Along with quarterly earnings, Hormel boosted its dividend by 2.7% to a new payout of $1.13 per share annually. This marks its 58th consecutive annual dividend increase.', 'Hormel’s main competitive advantage is its roughly 40 products that are either No. 1 or No. 2 in their category. Hormel has brands that are proven, and that leadership position is difficult for competitors to supplant. In addition, Hormel has a global network of distributors that few food companies can rival.', 'Despite the challenges seen this year, Hormel has a long track record of steady growth. It is a member of the Dividend Kings. Relatively consistent results have come from a steady stream of acquisitions along with organic growth. This has afforded Hormel the ability to consistently raise its dividend as well.', 'Hormel’s payout ratio is just under 70% of earnings. Furthermore, we expect that it will remain this way for the foreseeable future. HRL stock currently yields 3.5%.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has been in existence for more than 200 years, having been founded in 1806.

Adjusted EPS came to 86 cents, which was 6 cents ahead of estimates. Revenue was $4.92 billion, which was 10.3% higher year-over-year.', 'It also beat expectations by $100 million. Net sales were up 9% on an organic basis, with five out of the company’s six divisions posting gains, as well as all four of its product categories.', 'Gross margin came to 58.5% of revenue, up 130 basis points year-over-year.

After dodging the recession bullet last year, the Wall Street gods might not grant us good tidings over the next 365 days. Still, that doesn’t mean we should give up.', 'No, with the market providing thousands upon thousands of opportunities, it’s invariable that some ideas will slip under the radar. And we’re not talking about junk plays but diamonds in the rough – good enterprises that just slipped into rough circumstances. Further, with fundamental prospects possibly set to change in 2024, it’s time to keep your eyes on the prize.', 'Below are enticing ideas for hot stocks to watch in the new year.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'A specialty chemicals manufacturing firm, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) garners attention for its lithium market. It’s a great business to be in. Per Grand View Research, the global lithium market reached a valuation of $8.2 billion last year. Experts anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% from 2024 to 2030. At the culmination point, we’re talking about annual revenue of nearly $19 billion.', 'Now, here’s the opportunity. According to investment data aggregator Gurufocus, ALB trades at a forward earnings multiple of 10.16X. That’s lower than the sector median, which comes in at 14.35X. And per Gurufocus’ proprietary calculation for intrinsic value, ALB is significantly undervalued. At a broader view, it’s difficult to argue the point. For instance, Albemarle’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at a blistering 45.7%.', 'Of course, the concern is whether ALB can continue its robust financial performance. I think it can because if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, electric vehicle sales may rise due to lowered borrowing costs. If so, ALB would likely rank among the hottest stocks to watch.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'An intriguing idea for hot stocks to watch, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is a hydrocarbon exploration firm. That means it specializes in the upstream component of the energy value chain. And make no mistake, it’s a relevant sector. According to Mordor Intelligence, the U.S. upstream market produces 12.4 million barrels per day. Further, this production should expand at a CAGR of 2.3% through 2028.', 'Let’s be brutally honest. While we all appreciate the upside possibilities of enterprises like Albemarle for their EV relevancies, the world still runs on oil. When you consider areas such as air transportation, the world may continue running on oil for decades to come. Fundamentally, that’s where the opportunity for DVN as one of the hottest stocks to watch lies. I don’t think DVN’s loss of 22% last year has baked in the long-term relevance.', 'No matter, you can pick up DVN at a forward earnings multiple of 7.14X. That’s a discount compared to the 8.22X sector median. Analysts also assign shares as a moderate buy with a $56.28 target, implying 24% upside.', 'Source: Jason Patrick Ross/Shutterstock.com', 'A hotel and casino entertainment company, Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) had an okay performance last year. However, gaining 11% of equity value isn’t exactly thrilling stuff when the benchmark equities index popped up nearly 25%. Still, with enough patience, CZR may prove to be one of the hottest stocks to watch in 2024.', 'According to ReportLinker, the U.S. casino gaming market should grow by $13.26 billion between 2022 through 2027. That would translate to a CAGR of 4.53%. Further, the trend aligns with global statistics. Per Mordor Intelligence, the worldwide casino gambling market should reach a valuation of $182.33 billion by 2028. If so, we’re talking about a CAGR of 4.95%.', 'Further, if policymakers decide to lower borrowing costs, consumer sentiment may improve. In addition, Caesars being local to Americans may benefit as a more efficient entertainment idea; in other words, it provides bang for the buck. It also trades at a discount at 12.59X forward earnings, below the sector median 16.13X.', 'Analysts rate CZR a strong buy with a $61.45 target, projecting 31% upside potential.', 'Source: JosephRouse / Shutterstock', 'I’m going to be brutally honest with you. The reason I believe Geo Group (NYSE:GEO) represents one of the hot stocks to watch comes down to Donald J. Trump. Based on the current political trajectory, Trump stands a great chance of winning a second non-consecutive term. Reuters provided the critical insight. While President Biden’s policies are popular, he is not.', 'Further, let’s also raise another honest point. Trump commands masculine energy and to American voters, there’s something satisfying about a man slamming his fist down and saying enough is enough. And we all know that Trump is not afraid to say some incredibly controversial things, things that normal folks would never utter for fear of reputational and financial damage.', 'Of course, one of those controversial subjects centers on the whole law and order theme. Trump loves talking about it and it will almost certainly be a central campaign strategy. Worse yet, I’m not sure Biden has an answer for the criticism that’s coming his way.', 'With that being the case, the thesis for GEO as one of the hottest stocks to watch is self-explanatory.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.com', 'A global leader in agribusiness, Bunge (NYSE:BG) represents a key member of the global food value chain. However, its market performance in 2023 belies its relevance, gaining a very modest 5.6%. Even worse, BG shares slipped more than 8% in the trailing month to end the year. How then could BG be one of the hot stocks to watch?', 'From a monetary policy perspective, cheaper credit could encourage farmers to invest in land and equipment. Downstream, that could help lift demand for Bunge. Further, I don’t anticipate geopolitical flashpoints to ease up in 2024. If anything, tensions could expand, particularly as China has been flexing its military muscle recently. That could drive up food prices, which cynically could improve Bunge’s profitability.', 'Further, deserves closer examination as one of the hottest stocks to watch in the new year. Per Gurufocus, BG trades at a forward earnings multiple of 8.49X. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 14.92X.', 'Again, the permanent relevancy of the food supply chain should see an expanded opportunity for Bunge. Analysts agree, rating shares a strong buy with a $137.50 price target.', 'Source: QualityHD/Shutterstock.com', 'Based in St. Louis, Missouri, Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW) sells teddy bears and other stuffed animals and characters. To be sure, BBW ranks among the higher-risk entities for hottest stocks to watch in 2024. Last year, shares lost a bit more than 6% of equity value. That’s not an encouraging backdrop by any measure. Still, lower rates could boost sentiment for BBW.', 'During the recent holiday shopping season, consumers turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms. Stated differently, demand for consumer discretionary goods didn’t necessarily fade. Rather, the mechanism for paying for such products change. Presumably, then, lower borrowing costs should buttress consumer sentiment. In turn, that should help a specialized discretionary retail play like Build-A-Bear.', 'Further, the U.S. toys market reached a valuation of $24.34 billion in 2022. Experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 4.5% through 2028. That being the case, I find BBW’s lowly forward earnings multiple of 6.68X to be a credible discount.', 'Analysts concur, pegging shares a moderate buy with an average $37 price target. That implies nearly 61% growth.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'If the Fed goes through with interest rate cuts – especially if they’re sizable cuts – then precious metals miner DRDGold (NYSE:DRD) belongs on your radar for hottest stocks to watch. Historically, gold represents an inflation hedge. Lower borrowing costs imply a devaluation of the dollar relative to other currencies. In that case, commodities should rise, which will almost certainly affect precious metals.', 'Of course, many other stable or dare I say it sensible alternatives exist to DRD. However, we’re talking about hot stocks to watch, not blue chips to fall asleep to. If you’re on the young side of a 40-year retirement plan, be my guest. However, if you want the robust performance of 2023 to continue into the new year, DRD offers the right mix of volatility and rationality to move the needle.', 'Enticingly, the gold miner trades at 10.14X trailing-year earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 15.83X. Given the prospect of lower rates, investors may find DRDGold’s discount credible.', 'Finally, H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle rates DRD a buy with a $13.25 target, implying almost 67% upside.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

However, there was a noticeable improvement after Joe Biden assumed office. While the recent 2023 report by Pew Research Center indicates generally positive views of the US across the countries surveyed, there remain specific nations where Americans are not perceived favorably. The survey highlights that a significant number of individuals in Southern European countries hold negative opinions of the US. Americans may feel unwelcome, particularly in nations opposing US foreign policy and where it's actively involved in international politics, including various countries in the Middle East. You can also check out the 25 Most Unfriendly Countries in the World here."", 'During 2022, around 93 million Americans were estimated to have taken international outbound trips. This number is expected to increase further due to the rising trend of escapism and the heightened preference of Americans to spend their holidays abroad. With the rising number of Americans traveling abroad, their role as unofficial ambassadors of the country has become increasingly important. In May 2023, international departures increased by 24% compared to May 2022 and 99% compared to May 2019. According to the International Trade Administration, Mexico and Canada experienced the highest number of visitors from the US in May 2023. Meanwhile, Europe accounted for 25.4% of departures year-to-date (YTD) in May 2023, establishing itself as the second most popular destination among Americans. Some of the most American-friendly European countries include Poland and Finland. In contrast, among the\xa0countries that dislike American tourists are Egypt and Jordan.

The increase in expenditure is expected to be driven by over 2 billion international trips, reflecting a 3% uptick from the pre-pandemic levels. Europe is likely to experience a favorable year due to the rising demand for leisure activities and the hosting of the Olympic Games in France. Furthermore, the United Kingdom is anticipating a 7% year-on-year increase in spending on travel and tourism, backed by a 5% growth in volume in 2024. This would bring the industry within 3% of 2019 figures, with a full recovery expected in 2025. Meanwhile, the US is expected to continue the trend of outperforming Europe. However, the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine pose a potential risk to the recovery of international travel and tourism.

Booking maintains a strong competitive moat, in terms of direct traffic share and marketing efficiency, and its strength in alternative accommodations.

Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

And it can be fun to attempt to peer into the proverbial crystal ball."", ""With that in mind, I've been looking at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio to try to identify his most likely winners in the new year. I predict that these will be Buffett's three top dividend stocks in 2024."", ""Let me acknowledge right out of the gate that D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) doesn't offer a fantastic dividend. No one is going to jump up and down about the company's dividend yield of around 0.8%. But I think that D.R. Horton's growth prospects in 2024 could be worth getting excited about."", 'Buffett first bought D.R. Horton shares last year.

I think his confidence is well-placed."", ""Granted, Occidental hasn't performed well over the last 12 months. Some of that can be chalked up to investors shifting to high-growth stocks. Uncertainty about the economy also likely weighed on Occidental."", ""But, as already mentioned, the economic outlook for 2024 could be better than previously expected. Occidental's valuation -- shares trade at less than 11.6 times forward earnings -- could cause more investors to take a second look. Also, oil price forecasts for this year reflect moderate increases from the current price levels."", 'I also anticipate that Berkshire will continue to scoop up more shares, potentially boosting the stock.

But even though Apple has represented an outsized position for years, it didn't stop Buffett and his team from purchasing more than 20 million additional shares last year."", 'Apple checks most of the key boxes Warren Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) look for in a company. It offers brand-name products and services, has a well-trusted management team, is highly profitable, and has an exceptionally loyal customer base.', ""More specifically, Apple's iPhone has gobbled up more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, the company's services segment continues to grow like wildfire, with a shift to subscription services expected to lift the company's operating margin over time and lessen the sales fluctuations observed during iPhone replacement cycles."", ""Apple's capital-return program is also unmatched among publicly traded companies. The world's largest public company by market cap is doling out $15 billion annually in dividend payments, and has repurchased over $600 billion of its common stock since the start of 2013."", 'The one knock against Apple is its valuation. While Warren Buffett is typically a sticker for value -- this is something he learned decades ago from the late, great Charlie Munger -- Apple is trading for nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, which is historically high given its recent lack of growth.', 'Another top holding Warren Buffett and his investing aides are clearly betting big on in the new year is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Though Berkshire entered 2023 with 1.01 billion shares of BofA already in its portfolio, Buffett and his investing team proceeded to purchase more than 22.7 million additional shares in the March-ended quarter.', ""The lure of bank stocks for Warren Buffett is that they're cyclical. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable aspect of the economic cycle, downturns are short-lived. Not one recession following World War II has lasted longer than 18 months. That compares to two periods of economic growth that lasted at least a decade. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to grow their loan portfolios and generate valuable interest income."", ""Speaking of interest income, no U.S. money-center bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle than Bank of America. A collective 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate since March 2022 has lifted the interest rates on outstanding variable-rate loans and boosted BofA's net interest income by billions of dollars each quarter."", ""Investors also have to be pleased with Bank of America's investments in technology paying off. As more users shift to digital banking, which is considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, Bank of America has the option of consolidating some of its physical branches and lowering its operating expenses."", ""As long as Bank of America's stock trades at or around its book value, you won't have to twist Warren Buffett's arm to potentially buy more shares."", ""It's also plainly evident that Warren Buffett is betting big on energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway added more than 49 million shares of Occidental's common stock in 2023, with Buffett and his crew building this 243.7-million-share position from scratch over the past two years."", ""The Oracle of Omaha and his team aren't riding a $14.6 billion position without a purpose. They're very likely betting on the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated, if not head even higher."", ""In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which created uncertainty for Europe's energy supply needs. Additionally, global energy companies meaningfully reduced their capital expenditures for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these factors have tightened global oil supply, which is likely to have a positive effect on the spot price of crude oil."", ""What makes Occidental Petroleum so attractive is its reliance on drilling. Although it's an integrated oil and gas company that also operates chemical plants, it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of crude remains elevated or heads even higher, Occidental's cash flow will benefit immensely."", ""Just keep in mind that Occidental's balance sheet is a potential question mark. Despite paying down more than $17 billion in net debt following its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still sitting on $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2023. It very much needs the spot price for crude oil to remain high to improve the flexibility of its levered balance sheet."", ""A fourth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on in the new year is financial-services provider Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF). Berkshire's investment team gobbled up a little more than 9.9 million shares of Capital One during the first quarter of 2023, and purchased around 2.55 million additional shares during the June-ended quarter. Entering 2024, this position was worth north of $1.6 billion."", ""Similar to BofA, Warren Buffett's billion-dollar bet on Capital One looks to be a function of cyclicality and value."", ""Capital One is best-known as being one the nation's largest issuers of credit cards. The company closed out September with $144 billion in credit card loans on its books, $137.5 billion of which can be traced to the United States. With the U.S. economy shrugging off recessionary fears and the U.S. savings rate declining, Capital One Financial's credit-services segment has enjoyed an ideal operating environment."", ""The one caveat to the above is that Capital One's loan portfolio tends to be more reliant on subprime borrowers, when compared to the typical U.S. lender. If the U.S. economy contracts, subprime borrowers are, historically, likelier to default on their payments. There are a couple of money-based metrics that suggest 2024 could be a difficult year for the U.S. economy and stock market."", ""The other lure with Capital One Financial is its valuation. Similar to Bank of America, it's trading right around its book value and is sporting a forward-year earnings multiple of less than 10."", 'The fifth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on for 2024 is none other than his own company, Berkshire Hathaway. The Oracle of Omaha and late executive vice chairman Charlie Munger approved the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock for 21 consecutive quarters (July 2018-September 2023), totaling an aggregate of more than $72 billion.', ""Since Warren Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, buying back stock is one of the easiest ways to reward existing shareholders. Conducting more than $72 billion in repurchases is slowly but surely increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. It's a way of driving home the long-term ethos that Buffett and Munger have championed for decades."", 'Furthermore, repurchasing stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which for companies with steady or growing net income -- i.e., Berkshire Hathaway, sans unrealized changes in the value of its investment portfolio -- can increase earnings per share (EPS). A boost to EPS can make a fundamentally attractive company like Berkshire all the more desirable for value-seeking investors.', ""I believe it's also worth suggesting that Buffett's aggressive share buyback program reflects the confidence he and Munger had in the company they'd built over many years. This dynamic duo loaded their company's investment portfolio and owned assets with cyclical businesses that are poised to benefit from extended periods of economic growth."", 'Berkshire Hathaway is the stock Warren Buffett is virtually guaranteed to buy in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Though Berkshire entered 2023 with 1.01 billion shares of BofA already in its portfolio, Buffett and his investing team proceeded to purchase more than 22.7 million additional shares in the March-ended quarter.', ""The lure of bank stocks for Warren Buffett is that they're cyclical. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable aspect of the economic cycle, downturns are short-lived. Not one recession following World War II has lasted longer than 18 months. That compares to two periods of economic growth that lasted at least a decade. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to grow their loan portfolios and generate valuable interest income."", ""Speaking of interest income, no U.S. money-center bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle than Bank of America. A collective 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate since March 2022 has lifted the interest rates on outstanding variable-rate loans and boosted BofA's net interest income by billions of dollars each quarter."", ""Investors also have to be pleased with Bank of America's investments in technology paying off. As more users shift to digital banking, which is considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, Bank of America has the option of consolidating some of its physical branches and lowering its operating expenses."", ""As long as Bank of America's stock trades at or around its book value, you won't have to twist Warren Buffett's arm to potentially buy more shares."", ""It's also plainly evident that Warren Buffett is betting big on energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway added more than 49 million shares of Occidental's common stock in 2023, with Buffett and his crew building this 243.7-million-share position from scratch over the past two years."", ""The Oracle of Omaha and his team aren't riding a $14.6 billion position without a purpose. They're very likely betting on the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated, if not head even higher."", ""In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which created uncertainty for Europe's energy supply needs. Additionally, global energy companies meaningfully reduced their capital expenditures for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these factors have tightened global oil supply, which is likely to have a positive effect on the spot price of crude oil."", ""What makes Occidental Petroleum so attractive is its reliance on drilling. Although it's an integrated oil and gas company that also operates chemical plants, it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of crude remains elevated or heads even higher, Occidental's cash flow will benefit immensely."", ""Just keep in mind that Occidental's balance sheet is a potential question mark. Despite paying down more than $17 billion in net debt following its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still sitting on $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2023. It very much needs the spot price for crude oil to remain high to improve the flexibility of its levered balance sheet."", ""A fourth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on in the new year is financial-services provider Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF). Berkshire's investment team gobbled up a little more than 9.9 million shares of Capital One during the first quarter of 2023, and purchased around 2.55 million additional shares during the June-ended quarter. Entering 2024, this position was worth north of $1.6 billion."", ""Similar to BofA, Warren Buffett's billion-dollar bet on Capital One looks to be a function of cyclicality and value."", ""Capital One is best-known as being one the nation's largest issuers of credit cards. The company closed out September with $144 billion in credit card loans on its books, $137.5 billion of which can be traced to the United States. With the U.S. economy shrugging off recessionary fears and the U.S. savings rate declining, Capital One Financial's credit-services segment has enjoyed an ideal operating environment."", ""The one caveat to the above is that Capital One's loan portfolio tends to be more reliant on subprime borrowers, when compared to the typical U.S. lender. If the U.S. economy contracts, subprime borrowers are, historically, likelier to default on their payments. There are a couple of money-based metrics that suggest 2024 could be a difficult year for the U.S. economy and stock market."", ""The other lure with Capital One Financial is its valuation. Similar to Bank of America, it's trading right around its book value and is sporting a forward-year earnings multiple of less than 10."", 'The fifth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on for 2024 is none other than his own company, Berkshire Hathaway. The Oracle of Omaha and late executive vice chairman Charlie Munger approved the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock for 21 consecutive quarters (July 2018-September 2023), totaling an aggregate of more than $72 billion.', ""Since Warren Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, buying back stock is one of the easiest ways to reward existing shareholders. Conducting more than $72 billion in repurchases is slowly but surely increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. It's a way of driving home the long-term ethos that Buffett and Munger have championed for decades."", 'Furthermore, repurchasing stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which for companies with steady or growing net income -- i.e., Berkshire Hathaway, sans unrealized changes in the value of its investment portfolio -- can increase earnings per share (EPS). A boost to EPS can make a fundamentally attractive company like Berkshire all the more desirable for value-seeking investors.', ""I believe it's also worth suggesting that Buffett's aggressive share buyback program reflects the confidence he and Munger had in the company they'd built over many years. This dynamic duo loaded their company's investment portfolio and owned assets with cyclical businesses that are poised to benefit from extended periods of economic growth."", 'Berkshire Hathaway is the stock Warren Buffett is virtually guaranteed to buy in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

And one that fits the bill right now is CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP). The biotech company recently won approval for its first product -- one that shows the strength of its gene editing technology and could potentially bring in billions of dollars in revenue."", ""You won't need a fortune to invest in CRISPR Therapeutics, trading for about $60 a share. But if you have $1,000, you can pick up a solid handful of shares and possibly set yourself up for a big win down the road as the company progresses along the path of earnings growth and additional product approvals. Let's find out more about this ultimate growth stock to pick up right now."", 'CRISPR Therapeutics is revving up for its first year as a commercial-stage company. Late last year, the biotech won approval in the U.S. for Casgevy, a treatment for sickle cell disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to decide on Casgevy for an additional blood disorder -- beta thalassemia -- in March.', ""And a few weeks before the U.S. decision, Casgevy scored the world's first authorization of a CRISPR gene editing treatment when the U.K. gave it the nod for both blood disorders. Gene editing involves the fixing of faulty genes responsible for disease. The company's method involves cutting DNA in a particular location and letting a natural repair process take place."", 'Casgevy could bring in as much as $3.9 billion in peak annual sales, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.', ""This sounds exciting -- and it is -- but it's important to keep a few points in mind. First, CRISPR Therapeutics shares Casgevy profits with big biotech partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals -- and Vertex takes a 60% share. Second, Casgevy sales aren't likely to surge overnight. That's because the treatment requires a months' long process, so it will take some time to sign patients on, complete treatment, and collect revenue. And the companies still are working through reimbursement agreements with payors, another factor that may delay uptake and therefore revenue."", 'Still, even if revenue is slow to get rolling and CRISPR Therapeutics takes in a smaller share than its partner, the Casgevy approval represents a huge step for the company. The regulatory nod is a vote of confidence in the technology CRISPR Therapeutics uses across its pipeline, and the product revenue to follow will help the company advance those pipeline candidates.', ""And speaking of pipeline candidates, CRISPR Therapeutics recently set aside earlier immuno-oncology candidates in favor of its next-generation ones -- that's because these newer candidates show potential for better efficacy and also may be easier to manufacture. Clinical trials are ongoing for both of these next-generation candidates. At the same time, the company is taking one of them -- CTX-112 -- and expanding into autoimmune diseases. It aims to launch a phase 1 trial in systemic lupus erythematosus in the first half of this year. All of this is positive because it shows CRISPR Therapeutics is pouring its resources into the most promising candidates -- and exploring their full potential."", 'Meanwhile, in the near term, CRISPR Therapeutics also may generate revenue by licensing out its gene editing technology. Last year, Vertex signed a deal to use the technology for its type 1 diabetes program and that brought the biotech a $100 million in an upfront payment as well as $70 million in milestone payments only a few months later.', ""So, right now, CRISPR Therapeutics is set to begin generating its first product revenue -- and this revenue should fund its pipeline of programs. Two promising immuno-oncology candidates already are involved in clinical trials, meaning they've passed some of the earlier stage safety and efficacy hurdles."", ""At the same time, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares trade much lower today than they did a few years ago, when we had much less visibility on the company's future. From today's level, the stock clearly could take off -- especially on positive Casgevy sales news and any potential good news from pipeline programs. And all of this makes CRISPR Therapeutics the ultimate growth stock to invest in right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

The business has steadily grown since the brand-name soda was invented in the late 1800s. Over the past 50 years, a starting $10,000 investment will have turned into over $1 million had you done nothing but reinvest the dividends to buy more stock.', 'The company has raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years, a streak that will likely continue thanks to a centuries-old recipe for success: population growth, price increases, and launching (or acquiring) new product brands. As long as people drink beverages, Coca-Cola should remain as relevant as it always has.', ""You can't tell America's story without acknowledging how McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)\xa0established fast food as a cultural staple and disrupted the restaurant business with its real-estate-centric franchising business model. There are more than 40,000 McDonald's locations worldwide today. The company doesn't own the vast majority of them. Instead, it leases the land to restaurant owners, generating reliable profits from the rent and royalties."", ""Decades of adding restaurants and raising the company's dividend for the past 48 years have made McDonald's a remarkable investment. Had you bought and held $10,000 in stock, it would have grown to over $11 million over its lifetime. As a symbol of Americana, there's no reason McDonald's can't keep serving up stellar investment returns for decades to come."", ""Look at the label on the soap in your bathroom, the toothpaste you brush with, or the shampoo you shower with every day. There's a solid chance you'll find Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) somewhere. The company's a conglomerate of household products, home to brands like Tide, Charmin, Gillette, Old Spice, Dawn, Cascade, Febreze, and many more. Consumers stash these household brand products and mindlessly replace them when they run out. Procter & Gamble has been doing this since 1837."", ""Again, it took many decades, but Procter & Gamble has treated investors well.

The index has suffered a double-digit decline in a calendar year only nine times since its inception in 1971.', 'Historically, those drawdowns have come with a silver lining. The Nasdaq usually rebounds strongly during the 24 months following an annual decline. Specifically, following a one-year decline of at least 10%, the Nasdaq has returned a median of 52% over the next two years.', 'To add context, the index has advanced about 39% since the beginning of 2023. If the rise sticks to the median, the upside would be about 13% through the rest of 2024. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns. When the Nasdaq nosedived in 2022, the trigger was a global pandemic for which there was no historical precedent. So the index may not perform as expected this year.', 'Nevertheless, the Nasdaq returned an average of almost 15% annually over the last decade, so patient investors can still buy stocks with confidence. Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) and Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) are compelling Nasdaq stocks to buy now given their competitive strengths, growth opportunities, and reasonable valuations.', 'Datadog specializes in IT observability and cybersecurity. Its platform comprises more than two dozen modules that source and analyze machine data from across the corporate technology stack, helping businesses identify and resolve performance issues and security threats throughout their applications and infrastructure. That data also informs its artificial intelligence (AI) engine, which automates investigative workflows to accelerate incident remediation.', 'Datadog is a recognized leader in several observability software verticals, including application performance monitoring and AI for IT operations. The company also has a strong presence in data center server monitoring, log monitoring, and cloud infrastructure monitoring. The driving forces behind that success are continuous innovation and a deep portfolio. Datadog regularly releases new modules and features, and its broad software suite allows businesses to replace disjointed point products with an integrated platform from a single vendor. That can improve operating efficiency.', 'Circling back to innovation, Datadog quickly pivoted to monetize demand for generative AI by launching a new software module. LLM Observability brings performance monitoring to the large language models that power generative AI applications. Notably, Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research believes Datadog could become ""the fastest growing software company"" as the generative AI boom unfolds.', 'Datadog posted stellar financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 25% year over year to $548 million and non-GAAP net income soared 96% to $158 million. Investors can expect a similar growth trajectory in the years ahead. Datadog has only tapped a fraction of its $45 billion addressable market, but IT trends like cloud migration and digital transformation will make performance monitoring and security software increasingly important over time.', 'On that note, Morningstar analysts expect Datadog to grow revenue by 31% annually over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 18.3 times sales looks fair, especially when the three-year average is 31.2 times sales. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this technology stock today.', 'Intuit provides financial software and services to small businesses, self-employed persons, and individual consumers. The company holds a 73% market share in tax preparation software with TurboTax, and it holds an 80% market share in accounting software with QuickBooks. Inuit also owns Credit Karma, a financial management platform that leans on its vast data to connect consumers with credit cards, loans, and insurance products.', 'Intuit hopes to deepen its relationship with small businesses by providing adjacent services for payment processing, payroll, and marketing. The company also offers access to bookkeeping professionals through QuickBooks Live, as well as tax professionals through TurboTax Live. Those products let users (1) seek expert advice or (2) outsource accounting and tax preparation.', 'Intuit posted reasonably good financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31, 2023). Revenue increased 15% year over year to $3 billion and non-GAAP net income jumped 45% to $960 million. Management expects momentum to moderate in future quarters. Full-year guidance calls for revenue to rise 11.5% with non-GAAP EPS growth of 13%. Investors should anticipate a similar trajectory in the years ahead as Intuit leans into its ""AI-driven expert platform"" strategy.', 'Intuit recently launched a generative AI assistant (Intuit Assist) that provides predictive insights and automates workflows across TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Credit Karma. For instance, Intuit Assist can reduce tax preparation time by creating checklists, finding deductions, and steering users toward tax professionals when necessary. In that way, the generative AI assistant will not only improve the user experience but also drive the adoption of TurboTax Live. The same applies to QuickBooks Live.', 'Looking forward, Intuit believes it has captured just 5% of its $300 billion addressable market, and management is targeting double-digit revenue growth over the next three to five years. That forecast reflects annual revenue growth of 10% in TurboTax software and services, 17.5% in QuickBooks software and services, and 22.5% in Credit Karma.', 'In that context, its current valuation of 11.3 times sales seems reasonable, and it falls slightly below the three-year average of 11.5 times sales.

As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Stryker's  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for Stryker ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:', '14% = US$2.6b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To start with, Stryker's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.6% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. As you might expect, the 3.2% net income decline reported by Stryker is a bit of a surprise. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""However, when we compared Stryker's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 9.4% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Stryker fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', ""In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 49% (that is, a retention ratio of 51%), the fact that Stryker's earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""Moreover, Stryker has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 22% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio."", ""Overall, we feel that Stryker certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Better yet, make that an entire shaker of salt. No one knows for sure what will happen."", ""Still, there can sometimes be information that allows us to envision outcomes that are somewhat likely based on what's known right now. And it can be fun to attempt to peer into the proverbial crystal ball."", ""With that in mind, I've been looking at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio to try to identify his most likely winners in the new year. I predict that these will be Buffett's three top dividend stocks in 2024."", ""Let me acknowledge right out of the gate that D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) doesn't offer a fantastic dividend. No one is going to jump up and down about the company's dividend yield of around 0.8%. But I think that D.R. Horton's growth prospects in 2024 could be worth getting excited about."", 'Buffett first bought D.R. Horton shares last year. The stock has already made Berkshire plenty of money after skyrocketing more than 60% over the last 12 months. Even after this impressive gain, though, D.R. Horton remains attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of only 11.3.', ""I picked D.R. Horton as a top Buffett dividend stock for 2024 for one primary reason: There's an ongoing housing shortage in the United States. D.R. Horton ranks as the largest homebuilder in the country based on volume, a distinction it's held for more than 20 years. It's arguably in as good of a position to profit from addressing the housing shortage as any company around."", 'The Federal Reserve signaling multiple interest rate cuts this year is icing on the cake, in my view.

The stock also should have plenty of room for growth, in my view."", ""Berkshire has owned Mitsui since August 2020 and added more shares last year. It's one of five Japanese trading houses that Buffett and his late business partner Charlie Munger saw as great investment opportunities. They were right. Mitsui stock jumped nearly 28% in 2023 and has more than doubled since Berkshire opened its position."", ""I suspect that economic conditions will work in Mitsui's favor this year. The global economy is heavily influenced by how the U.S. economy fares. With inflation coming down, unemployment levels remaining low, and the possibility (or perhaps even probability) of lower interest rates, Mitsui's near-term prospects look promising."", ""Of course, we could say the same thing about any of the other four Japanese stocks that Buffett owns. I chose Mitsui for this list, though, because it's virtually tied with Itochu as Berkshire's biggest position among the group but has a more attractive valuation."", ""Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is another Buffett stock that offers a relatively puny dividend. Its yield of 1.2% isn't horrible, but it's well below the S&P 500 average. However, Occidental is clearly one of Buffett's favorite stocks right now. I think his confidence is well-placed."", ""Granted, Occidental hasn't performed well over the last 12 months. Some of that can be chalked up to investors shifting to high-growth stocks. Uncertainty about the economy also likely weighed on Occidental."", ""But, as already mentioned, the economic outlook for 2024 could be better than previously expected. Occidental's valuation -- shares trade at less than 11.6 times forward earnings -- could cause more investors to take a second look. Also, oil price forecasts for this year reflect moderate increases from the current price levels."", 'I also anticipate that Berkshire will continue to scoop up more shares, potentially boosting the stock.

If you're looking for dividend-paying tech stocks, the following three are good options with above-average yields."", 'International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), better known as IBM, doesn\'t get the attention the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks do, but it has been a tech titan in its own right for a while.
