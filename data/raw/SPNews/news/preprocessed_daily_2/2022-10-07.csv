Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verisk Analytics, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$7.5b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Verisk Analytics has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics roceIn the above chart we have measured Verisk Analytics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verisk Analytics here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Verisk Analytics' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has employed 30% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 22%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Verisk Analytics can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.On another note, while the change in ROCE trend might not scream for attention, it's interesting that the current liabilities have actually gone up over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 28% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than22% because total capital employed would be higher.The 22% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 28% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. With that in mind, just be wary if this ratio increases in the future, because if it gets particularly high, this brings with it some new elements of risk.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Verisk Analytics' ROCEVerisk Analytics has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 121% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.One final note, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Verisk Analytics (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) .If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Following its philosophy and rationality as always, the fund consciously kept away from these niche markets. As the fear has spread, however, even the stocks of good companies have suffered – albeit to a lesser extent. Go over the fund’s top 5 positions to have a glimpse of its finest picks for 2022.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, IP Capital Partners mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and explained its insights for the company.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Charles Schwab certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab peKeen to find out how analysts think Charles Schwab's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Charles Schwab would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 27% gain to the company's bottom line. EPS has also lifted 15% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 21% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Charles Schwab is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Charles Schwab's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Charles Schwab.

In that report, analysts expect Nucor to post earnings of $6.45 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 11.4%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.06 billion, down 2.46% from the year-ago period.NUE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $29.84 per share and revenue of $41.58 billion.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $32.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Nucor shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Nucor is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Steel - Producers industry that ranks in the Bottom  38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $8.08 per share to $6.45 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Nucor right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 more basis points in September. Analysts are rightly nervous about how long this rising-price period will persist.However, one key sector of the economy is already signaling that the worst of the inflation has already passed. That indicator is commodities. Numerous commodities spiked in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this spring. Agricultural products were particularly impacted.Since then, however, wheat, corn, soybeans and oats, among others, have given back most or all of their post-invasion gains. The price of lumber has slumped by more half from its prior 2022 high. The price of copper, a key metal for electronics and construction, has dove this summer. Precious metals have reversed their prior rally. Oil has fallen back below $100 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLong story short, the surge in commodities is now turning into a crash.It’s unlikely that prices will return all the way to pre-pandemic levels.

NUE stock is trading at roughly five times this year’s estimated earnings, which might sound like a steal. But analysts expect profits to drop by nearly two-thirds over the next two years. The falling demand for housing, autos and other big-ticket items after a record 2021 will hit cyclical players such as steel producers hard.Nucor will be a buy again once the economy stabilizes, but for now, it’s wise to avoid the stock until earnings stop sliding.MP Materials (MP)Best rare earth stocks: a pile of rare earth metalsSource: Joaquin Corbalan P / ShutterstockMP Materials (NYSE:MP) is a mining company focused on rare earth materials such as neodymium. You may remember the company as Molycorp. That predecessor firm had a stock that went up tenfold at one point but ultimately went bankrupt in 2015 when the commodity cycle turned south.MP Materials grabbed Molycorp’s mine out of bankruptcy and is now publicly traded following a SPAC deal. Once again, traders have gravitated to MP stock, thanks to geopolitical uncertainty with China. Rare earth materials are in (relatively) short supply, and having a U.S.-based mine could be a strategic asset.However, price plays a key role. MP stock is still trading at three times its initial SPAC offering price. That’s a rather lofty valuation compared to almost all other SPACs as of late. Meanwhile, the price of neodymium has fallen by nearly half since its February peak. Combine a weakening profit outlook with the fading momentum for mining stocks and MP shares could give back much of their gains.United States Steel (X)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor is far from the only steel stock vulnerable to a downturn in pricing and demand. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stands out as another industry player that traders should sell now.Historically, U.S. Steel has been even more of a boom-bust entity than Nucor since it has a higher cost profile. U.S. Steel has had various years where it lost money during down cycles. Analysts expect big problems for the company once again. Current analyst forecasts suggest the firm’s profits will drop 26% this year, plunge 70% next year, and fall another 39% in 2024. All told, that would take the company’s earnings from more than $15 per share on a trailing basis to less than $2 per share by 2024.A lot of traders see X stock going for less than two times trailing earnings and think the stock must be the deal of the century. But those earnings were exceptionally temporary in nature. With the economy turning south, energy prices rising and demand from China looking sluggish, look for U.S. Steel’s recent prosperity to come to an abrupt end.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comUnlike most of the other stocks on the list, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is still enjoying peak enthusiasm. In fact, ALB stock hit new 52-week highs in September.On the face of it, everything seems to be going right for the gigantic lithium producer. Lithium demand is surging thanks to electric vehicles and other renewable power applications which require batteries. The recent Inflation Reduction Act should provide further subsidies to drive adoption. And the nation of Chile, where Albemarle has extensive operations, just rejected a proposed anti-business constitutional reform process.So what’s not to like?For one thing, shares have already run up 15% this year. 15 times earnings doesn’t seem excessive, but earnings may come under pressure as additional supplies of lithium come online. Additionally, the current electricity squeeze we’re seeing in various markets such as Europe and California may slow down the momentum for electric vehicles a bit. Albemarle is a good company. But shares are prone to a technical correction here, especially as commodity stocks in general are in a broad selloff.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is one of the world’s largest precious metals mining companies. To that point, it has more than 92 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.Unfortunately for investors, the bull case around gold has failed to play out as expected. With the surge in inflation, gold and silver were supposed to soar to new heights. Instead, they rallied modestly and then sputtered out. If gold can’t work as an inflation hedge now, amid unprecedented rising prices, when is it going to pan out?Meanwhile, even after the sharp decline in the price of NEM stock, shares still aren’t cheap. Newmont is currently going for around 18 times this year’s estimated earnings. And analysts see earnings dropping in both 2o22 and 2023. Bulls can point to the company’s 5% dividend yield as a saving grace. But with earnings forecast to come in around $2.50 per share this year, there’s little margin of error for Newmont’s current dividend. With precious metals falling, profits stagnant, and a possible dividend cut on the horizon, Newmont is a sell today.Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is a leading producer of aggregates that are used in construction. Building materials have been a great place to be over the past year. Vulcan sells into the housing market, which was scorching hot until a few months ago. It’s also big in providing materials used in road construction; this area gained investor enthusiasm thanks to the passage of the federal infrastructure package.Vulcan is a better business than it might seem like due to geographical advantages. Namely, aggregates are exceptionally heavy and thus it’s not cost-effective to ship them far. As a result, Vulcan often tends to have monopolies on local markets and get good pricing power when it sells products.However, there are limits to how much this sort of business is worth. And VMC stock is currently testing said limits. At 30x this year’s estimated earnings, Vulcan stock is going at a hefty premium for a company that sells concrete, asphalt and other such basic goods. Throw in a slowing housing market, and Vulcan shares seem set to deflate a bit from their currently lofty perch.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlmost all of the major oil and gas stocks look cheap based on their current earnings outlooks. Despite big gains in their share prices over the past 18 months, oil stocks still seem like reasonable bets to close out 2022.But not all oil companies are created equal. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is infamous for its questionable capital allocation decisions. Specifically, its move to overpay when acquiring Anadarko in 2019 led the company to a liquidity crunch. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stepped in with financing for Occidental at the time and has made a small fortune off that prescient move.Fast forward to today and Berkshire continues adding to its stake in Occidental. This may make sense from Buffett’s position as a large shareholder that can influence the business.For minority shareholders, however, Occidental remains a company with an unimpressive track record and a fairly middling collection of oil assets. With oil prices now backing off their recent peak, this is a great time to rotate out of a riskier oil stock like Occidental and into more trustworthy ones with greater operational stability.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BRK-B stock.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s rise of 26.8% over the same time frame. Moreover, it topped the S&amp;P 500’s 20.6% decline over the same period.Let’s take a look into the factors behind this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s price appreciation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving CF?CF Industries is gaining from strong nitrogen fertilizer demand. Global demand for nitrogen is expected to remain strong in 2022. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.The company, on its second-quarter call, said that it sees the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to remain tight for the foreseeable future, supported by resilient agricultural-led demand and uncertainty about global production and export supply availability. Energy spreads between low-cost producers and marginal production in Europe and Asia also expected to remain historically wide.CF Industries expects nitrogen demand for industrial use in North America to be supported by mining activity. It also envisions India to tender on a regular basis into 2023 as higher domestic production is unlikely to fully meet increased demand as growers boost grain production. The company also envisions urea consumption in Brazil to remain strong this year, backed by high crop prices, expected high planted corn acres and improved farm incomes.The company is also benefiting from higher nitrogen prices on the back of lower supply resulting from reduced operating rates globally due to higher energy prices. Higher nitrogen prices are driving its sales as witnessed in the last-reported quarter. The positive pricing environment is expected to continue moving ahead. Global nitrogen supply is expected to remain challenged due to higher energy prices and geopolitical factors.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. Its net cash provided by operating activities was $889 million for the second quarter, up nearly seven-fold year over year. The company repurchased around 6.6 million shares for $590 million during the first half of 2022.Story continuesCF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusCF Industries Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) Shares Could Be 38% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-nyse-wmt-shares-120059754.html,1665144059,STORY,['WMT'],"[Does the October share price for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$16.0bUS$15.8bUS$16.6bUS$18.9bUS$20.1bUS$21.0bUS$21.8bUS$22.5bUS$23.1bUS$23.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.48%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.81%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$15.2kUS$14.3kUS$14.2kUS$15.4kUS$15.5kUS$15.4kUS$15.2kUS$14.9kUS$14.5kUS$14.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$149bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$24b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$713bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$713b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$424bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$573b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$132, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walmart as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

You're Rangers, great.- Let's go Rangers!JULIE HYMAN: I know how much all of our producers love sports, but let's take a look at what's going on with the markets because we've got a pause in the rally that we've been seeing as of late.

And I know Brad is taking a look at some of the groups that are on the move.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, we are pretty much red across the board, except for one bright spot, which I want to zero in on a hot second there. And that is XLY, consumer discretionary. But we've got 11 out of-- or 10 out of 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors right now in negative territory to start off the day.I mentioned that zero in on consumer discretionary. As of right now, holding on to slight gains, by the hair of chinny-chin-chin of about 1/10 of percent. And here's why I want to go further into that. You've had a lot of news come out in the retail landscape here today.And diving into the retail heat map, as we kick off today's trading session. I'm just gonna make this equal, give us a good look at a lot of the names as they're trending here on the day. And you still do have a lot of positive momentum.Story continuesKeep a close eye on Target, TGT, that is a company that's kicking off some of its Deal Days today, October 6 through 8. And that really comes as we're seeing some of the holiday sales get pulled earlier in the year. We've seen that from Target. We've seen that from Walmart as well.Not to be confused with Target's Deal Days, Walmart's Deals for Days. That's gonna go live next Monday, October 10, and that's gonna run through the 13. And then after that-- or within it, rather, you've got Amazon's Prime Early Access Sale, October 11 through 12.So I'm keeping a close eye on Target here on the day. That's holding on to some gains at the open. You've also had some deal-making as well take place. Walmart buying Alert Innovation. And so we'll continue to see exactly where Walmart moves from here. You're seeing those shares hold on to slight gains, fractional gains, by about 4/10 of percent.And since I mentioned Walmart and Target, also got to mention Amazon as well here, as I'll just make this a market weight-- we call them out real quick. They're down by about 2/10 of a percent right now.And we mentioned some of the hiring that's been taking place. Of course, we knew Target was going to hire up to 100,000 holiday workers. We know that Walmart was going to hire 40,000. Now, Amazon announcing today that they're going to hire 150,000 workers for the holiday season, along with a pay of about $19 an hour. So we're gonna keep a close eye on all of these retail stocks as we move on throughout the rest of the day. But that's a broad look at where we're trending right now in retail.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.03%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.15%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.33%.Heading into today, shares of the department store operator had gained 2.65% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 3.58% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.51% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nordstrom as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Nordstrom to post earnings of $0.13 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 66.67%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.5 billion, down 3.63% from the prior-year quarter.JWN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.40 per share and revenue of $15.56 billion.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Prior to Tesco, he spearheaded operational and technical innovations as chief technology officer of global travel company Expedia, including online travel brands, Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Hotwire.com. Mesrobian also held the role of CTO at Real Networks, where he led development across multiple digital media services and software.Story continuesWhen he joined Nordstrom he said the company was “leading the charge to redefine the role technology and digital tools play in the retail environment.”At WWD’s recent technology conference, Mesrobian said, “We want to make Nordstrom a daily habit. The challenge is to keep improving our experience and keep getting closer to our customers. That’s our journey.“Data is a prerequisite,” the tech exec emphasized. “Knowing as much about the customer as you can is the first step.”During the pandemic, “Our stylists embraced technology to help them reach customers when they couldn’t come to the stores,” Mesrobian said. Through remote selling, “They could take styles and style boards and publish them, in a sense, on the larger internet so people got a point of view on fashion.”On Nordstrom’s approach to technology, Mesrobian said “there is not a goal of being an early adopter, for the sake of there being an early adopter. It has to make sense to create a value with that innovation.”He also said, “The world is going to see an explosion of different facets of augmented and virtual reality. We are seeing pilots of it now. There are flares, metaphorically that are out there.“The challenge is the world is moving from being transactional to one of engagement.” It’s not just about getting points for purchase, he suggested. “Loyalty is a vehicle for experience — invitations to a party, a fashion show, early access to fashion — not just transactions. That’s on our journey toward engagement as our North Star.”]"

View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Marc Oken bought US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$159). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Marc Oken.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

It's a combination of perhaps global warming, bigger vessels, and more demand, but we've stretched that season to almost seven months now,"" Del Rio said.Del Rio also added that Norwegian was looking to lessen its impact on the planet by finding more sustainable fuels for its ships.The cruise industry itself has been among the biggest opponents of environmental groups looking to raise awareness of climate change, even as it tries to clean up its act with less polluting ships.According to a study published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, a large cruise ship can have a carbon footprint greater than 12,000 cars.""We've committed to decarbonize completely and we're going to have to invest vast amounts of money to be able to do that,"" Del Rio said.""If we don't do what we say we're going to do, it's going to hurt my pocket and everybody else's pocket.""(Reporting by Uday Sampath and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

Earlier this week, Norwegian Cruise Lines eased up its COVID-19 restrictions, announcing that passengers will no longer be required to show they are vaccinated or wear a mask while on board. Joining us now to discuss that and the business is Norwegian Cruise Line CFO Mark Kempa.Mark, good to see you again. It's been a while. So take us to this decision on the mask front. What has been the customer response amongst those you've talked with?MARK KEMPA: Well, good morning, Brian. And thanks for having me from aboard beautiful Norwegian Prima. Look, you know, taking down the requirements, the-- you know, it eliminated another barrier for the traveler to see the world. And we-- our first set of that was in August, when we reduced the vaccination requirements. We immediately saw significant boost in our bookings as a result of that.And most recently, just this past Monday, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand also took down all vacc-- all testing requirements. So we look at it as it's just another barrier for us to remove for the traveler and make it easier for everybody to see the world.- Mark, the calendar is almost turned to 2023. What are you-- what are some of the major revenue obstacles you and the team are up against for next year?MARK KEMPA: Look, we see opportunity. We don't see-- we don't look at revenue as being an obstacle. We have a-- we have the youngest fleet in the industry. We have a sizable yet nimble fleet. When we look at our demand picture, our demand continues to be very, very strong, even against the backdrop of a lot of different world events, economic events.Our customer tends to be a higher-level customer than that of our peers. So while not insulated from any sort of recessionary issues or economic malaise, our customers tend to be more insulated and more resilient from that. So we don't look at it as revenue as-- revenue opportunities as being obstacles. We see many opportunities. And that's really been demonstrated when you look at our first half and our second quarter pricing.Story continuesI think, if I recall correctly, on our first half, our net per diems were up 18%. And yes, I said 18%. And if you look at our peers for the first half, they were roughly about flat. So everything we see in all of our indicators, whether it's our booking curve, what the consumer is spending on board today, all indicators are pointing that 2023 is setting up to be a phenomenal year for us.- What type of margins relative to when you were seeing full vessels, people booking on a very healthy basis, and when do you expect that you'll kind of reassume some of those statures?- Yeah. Look, pre-COVID, we were setting record-level margins. We had EBITDA margins roughly at about in the low 30s. And I would be naive to tell you that we're not seeing some sort of inflationary pressure today. But we believe that's short-term pressure. That's near-term pressure. And all signs that we're seeing, at least from the cost front, we're starting to see easing in all of the key commodities, whether it's proteins, fruits and vegetables, consumables, the like.But the other side of that coin is we're also able to garner very strong pricing. And again, as I said earlier, that's been evidenced by the fact of our performance in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. And if you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits.So again, there's-- you know, inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at and look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvements significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic.- Mark, it's Julie here. Let's talk about another important cost input that has nothing to do with commodities, and that's people, right, which seemingly every industry has been struggling with. How many people want to get on a ship as an employee these days? And how are they interacting also with the change in rules that you guys have been making?MARK KEMPA: Look, people want to travel. People want to experience the world. They want to see the world in all forms of fashion. It doesn't matter if it's a consumer, it's our employees, anybody.We're here in New York today. We expect a full ship. The ship is sailing this evening. It's going to be almost at full capacity, limited by our own restrictions as we launch a new vessel. But demand is off the charts. Consumers are past COVID. The world has past COVID.- Right. But employee-wise, so you guys aren't having trouble finding good people to staff the ships?MARK KEMPA: No. When you look at our employee base, our-- you know, you have to remember, our employee base, they did not receive subsidies during the course of the pandemic. So they wanted to come back to work. They were excited to come back to work. We've only seen employment issues very-- you know, on the very margin at best in certain areas. But overall, it has not had any impact on our experience that we offer to all of our guests.- Mark, that's good to hear about the Prima. I know it's a nice-looking ship. And of course, it's taken a while to get to this point, given everything going on in the world. But I also want to ask you too, in terms of the debt position, you know, as you look towards next year, how do you-- how are you going to repay some of that debt? Is it a-- is it a share sale? Are you going to try to refinance?MARK KEMPA: Look, we were very deliberate and proactive during the pandemic. You know, we had to add a lot of debt to the balance sheet. But when we added debt, we looked at it, and we looked at our maturity towers down the road. We wanted to ensure that we had a very clean path coming out of COVID.So as we look forward over the course of the next two to three years, we have about a billion dollars a year plus or minus that's coming due. And we firmly believe, given our trajectory today, that with our existing cash on hand and our expected organic cash flow, we are going to be able to pay off our debt in the normal course of business by just good old-fashioned earnings and cash generation. We have no appetite. Our board has no appetite to issue any sort of equity to pay down debt or to delever. We have the ability. This company is a cash engine machine.And if you look at the performance pre-pandemic, we were generating on average about a billion and a half, close to $2 billion of free cash flow. And we were also returning capital to shareholders at the same time. So again, as we get back to full operations, we expect to be back at full capacity for the second quarter of 2023. And that is by design. We think, given where 2023 and '24 are positioning, we have ample room to pay off our debt in the normal course.]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. MetLife (MET) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.49 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 2, 2022.MET has an Earnings ESP figure of 11.05%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34.MET is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Goldman Sachs (GS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 21, 2022, Goldman Sachs holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $7.92 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Goldman Sachs is $7.89, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.36%.Story continuesMET and GS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

McCormick said if the transaction isn’t done by 5 p.m. on Oct. 28, she will set new trial dates in November, according to an order issued Thursday.The ruling hands a partial victory to Musk, who earlier in the day had asked the judge to pause Twitter’s lawsuit against him ahead of an Oct. 17 trial date. But it also gives Musk a deadline by which he needs to make good on his April agreement to pay $54.20 a share -- an obligation he previously tried to abandon. Shares in San Francisco-based Twitter rose as much as 3.5% in late trading after the judge’s ruling, a sign of optimism that the order gives Twitter some of the certainty it was seeking.Acrimony between the parties escalated Thursday, with both sides trading barbs in court filings. Musk requested a pause in the hearing, saying the social media company “will not take yes for an answer” after he proposed consummating the buyout in an Oct. 3 letter. His lawyers targeted an Oct. 28 closing. Twitter had objected to the request, saying Musk “can and should” close the deal next week.Talks between the two sides had snagged after Musk said that his offer was now contingent on receiving $13 billion in debt financing. The original deal didn’t contain such a contingency. Musk said Twitter was resisting halting court proceedings based on the “theoretical possibility of a future failure to obtain the debt financing.”Following the judge’s ruling, Twitter General Counsel Sean Edgett sent an update to staffers, saying the company won’t be going to court Oct. 17 and will work to close the deal by Oct. 28 as ordered by the judge.Story continues“Our intention remains the same: to close the acquisition at the price and terms in the original merger agreement,” Edgett wrote in the memo reviewed by Bloomberg. “Thank you to all of the teams working hard to navigate these twists and turns.”Within hours of McCormick’s order, Musk began tweeting about his plans for Twitter. “There will be very rapid product evolution,” he wrote in response to another user’s query. “Software engineering, server operations &amp; design will rule the roost,” he continued in another post.No HarmIn their filing earlier Thursday, Musk’s lawyers had argued that a short pause would not harm Twitter. “In the event a closing does not occur, the litigation can promptly resume based on the then existing facts and whatever issues remain at the time.” But going ahead with the scheduled Oct. 17 trial, and the appeals that would follow, would have caused the deal to take “months” to complete, Musk’s lawyers said.Twitter said it’s dubious of Musk’s promises, and said that a banker involved in the debt financing testified earlier Thursday that Musk had yet to send them a borrowing notice, and had otherwise not communicated to them that he intended to close the deal. The banker also said that “the main task necessary to close the deal -- memorializing the debt financing -- could have happened in July but didn’t because Mr. Musk purported to terminate the deal.”“Now, on the eve of trial, defendants declare they intend to close after all,” Twitter said in its filing. “‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time,’ and so they ask to be relieved from a reckoning on the merits.”Musk’s proposed stay “is an invitation to further mischief and delay,” the platform added. “Until Defendants commit to close as required, Twitter is entitled to its day in Court.”The two parties had been gearing up for the week-long courtroom battle, which would have determined whether the billionaire had legitimate grounds to torpedo the buyout because of alleged fake user accounts. McCormick ruled against the Tesla Inc. CEO on about a half-dozen pre-trial issues that could have foreshadowed difficulties in making his case in court.Bank ObligationsSeven banks, led by Morgan Stanley, fully underwrote the debt portion of the financing, according to an April filing. As is usual in this type of contract, banks originally planned to sell most of that debt to institutional money managers before the Twitter deal closed, but they have always been on the hook for providing the funding if anything went wrong.There are very few, if any, ways for banks to get out of providing such debt commitments after signing the contract. And most banks wouldn’t want to, even if it meant preventing a loss, because backing out would reflect poorly on their investment banking business and could harm their ability to win new deals with companies and private equity firms in the future.A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment about the Musk deal.Bloomberg reported earlier that, as part of the talks with Twitter, Musk has also been seeking to reserve his rights to file a fraud suit over his claims the platform’s executives misled him and other investors about the number of spam and robot accounts among its more than 230 million users.Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, said in a statement Twitter had offered to take “billions” off its sale price in exchange for “self-serving conditions” that Musk refused. Twitter hasn’t replied to a request for comment on Spiro’s statement or the deal conditions it’s seeking.The case is Twitter v.

Analysts had estimated 12.1 trillion won on average. Sales also missed estimates, coming in at 76 trillion won. Samsung will provide net income and details of divisional performance with its full report at the end of this month.Global memory chipmakers warned in recent weeks that they are facing a tougher market as inventories build up and orders are being cut by data center as well as consumer tech clients after demand for PCs and smartphones weakened further than expected. Micron Technology Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. are cutting output to try and rebalance supply and avert a price crash.Shortly before Samsung’s results, US processor and graphics chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also missed estimates with its third-quarter sales figures, which came in $1 billion shy of its own forecast. “Macroeconomic conditions drove lower than expected PC demand and a significant inventory correction,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said.Samsung shares fell by as much as 2% in Seoul on Friday after the news.“This downcycle is not merely driven by typical supply and demand dynamics, it’s different from the past cycles due to geopolitical risks,” said Heo Pil-Seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. “The US government’s exports controls would further limit IT companies’ sales in China and a large chunk of demand for chips will be weakened. If AMD, Nvidia can’t sell their chips in China, memory makers’ earnings will deteriorate further.”Story continuesSouth Korea, home to the world’s two largest memory chipmakers, reported a decline in chip output in August for the first time in more than four years, according to Statistics Korea data. Samsung compatriot SK Hynix Inc. said during its last earnings call that a significant adjustment to its capital expenditure next year was “inevitable.”The sudden memory market crash comes after a series of macroeconomic shocks ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to soaring inflation and gas prices along with US Fed rate hikes. Consumer sentiment has rapidly deteriorated and memory buyers like PC manufacturers have reduced orders and are using their existing stockpiles.While electronics demand has crumbled this year, Morgan Stanley upgraded the semiconductor sector at the start of this week, which pushed Samsung and Hynix’s share prices up on the expectation of a market rebound in the latter half of 2023.TSMC, Chipmakers Rally After Morgan Stanley Calls a RecoveryStill, Samsung’s chip business head Kyung Kyehyun has said the memory market’s unlikely to find momentum for a recovery throughout next year. Kyung told employees at an internal event that Samsung cut its guidance for chip sales in the second half of this year by 32% compared to its forecast in April, according to the Korea Economic Daily.“Due to the extremely sluggish demand, customers began to reduce inventory from the end of 2Q22,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment &amp; Securities, noting that DRAM and NAND prices fell by 15% in the third quarter. “With the exception of some big tech companies, clients are slashing their chip orders despite sharp price cuts.”Samsung Warns Chip Industry Is Headed for Tough Close to 2022(Updates with share price and AMD earnings)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Twitter Deal Has Pierced Elon Musk’s Reality Distortion FieldHedge Fund Managers Paid for Stockpicking Genius Aren’t Showing Much of ItThe Great Post-Covid Online Shopping Bet Was a Costly DelusionA New Silicon Valley Emerges at the Arctic CircleTwitter Faces Only Bad Outcomes If the $44 Billion Musk Deal Closes©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to read about some more financial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now.Unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the past few years have helped finance stocks demonstrate their ability to be resilient during times of crisis, boosting investor confidence and resulting in a flurry of new activity in the sector. However, per research firm Deloitte, the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of regional or global recession in 2023 still loom as near-term challenges for the industry, as more regulation and requirements around transparency also become marketplace realities. Some of the best finance stocks to monitor in this macro environment include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). As rising interest rates increase the earnings of banks overnight, recession fears continue to make investors think twice about investments in the sector. In this context, banks are leaning on the lessons learned from the uncertainty of the past few years to focus on smart strategy and execution that relies on talent, technology, risk, and purpose to drive growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the financial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Best Financial Stocks To Buy NowInvestments, FinanceBest Financial Stocks To Buy Now14. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29   Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The company recently said it resolved technical issues that had prevented US bank account users from making payments or withdrawals for most of the day. The firm has been on a downward spiral in the last few weeks on the back of worsening crypto futures even as analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto technology. Story continuesOn September 14, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained a Neutral rating on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock and raised the price target to $78 from $64, highlighting that Coinbase has a substantial revenue opportunity that originates from higher interest rates.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $2.3 billion. Just like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US. It is one of the top financial stocks to invest in. Reports indicate that a recent phishing campaign has targeted the bank's new partnership with verification service Authentify. In the campaign, thousands of scam emails were sent to the bank's customers to try and trick them into uploading images of their identification cards. On September 26. Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker maintained a Neutral rating on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $125, noting that the rapid rise in Fed funds combined with outsized loan growth has led to a significant increase in funding costs for digitally-based depositories. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), with 7.85 million shares worth more than $818 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a financial holding company that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals.

Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with 13.98 million shares worth more than $1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is one of the world’s leading investment banks and wealth management firms. As the company has grown its wealth management business its earnings have become more predictable and valuable. The management team is very shareholder-friendly, allocating funds not needed to grow the business to repurchase shares and raise their dividend. In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide.

(NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a financial institution that provides a range of financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide.

(NYSE:GS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement.

(NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view.

The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83    Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services.

S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84  S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. The firm recently announced that it had partnered with Tradeweb Markets, a global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets to introduce electronic connectivity between primary and secondary markets.On August 29, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau maintained an Outperform rating on S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

The increase in extreme weather events, caused by climate change, has also sparked more corporate environmental commitments. And now there is a need to show outcomes from all of this as people are looking to companies for leadership.Companies should demonstrate how they are following through on their promises to people, the planet, or society - 84%The report also highlights how consumers are demanding genuine change, not just marketing campaigns. Companies should have a point of view on environmental sustainability - 78%Companies should change the way they operate to address D&amp;I - 72%Companies should encourage consumers to support social or environmental issues - 65%David Bentley, Global CEO of Porter Novelli, commented: ""Good intentions aren't enough. Consumers are tired of talk: they don't want to see campaigns, they want to see action. Companies are realizing the benefits of doing business better as all audiences demand integrity and business growth will depend on navigating the complex landscape of audience expectations.""Addressing the climate crisis is now table stakes for organizationsAfter fires, floods, and droughts this year, the environment is front and center in consumer minds. While quality products and services are a prerequisite for a thriving business, audiences across all ages now expect industry to address sustainability as a core quality issue.Story continuesMore than a third (36%) of consumers will start or increase purchasing from companies that share a point of view on environmental sustainability that is aligned with their own, but…Half (51%) of consumers report they will stop or reduce purchasing from companies that go back on promises they make to address social or environmental issues.The demand for operational D&amp;ISocial inequalities are now a new second business priority to address, with operational changes expected.One-third (32%) of consumers will start or increase purchasing from companies that change the way they operate to address diversity and inclusion.Nearly the same amount (29%) of consumers will recommend companies that change the way they operate to address diversity and inclusion to friends, family, and acquaintances.Conroy Boxhill, President of Porter Novelli U.S, commented: ""Consumers are looking to businesses for active leadership. The research shows clearly there's now a sense of urgency around companies' DE&amp;I efforts to the point that people are requesting they restructure operationally to drive this change.""Politics can be punishingIn the last couple of years, companies have chosen to wade into political issues like voting rights and Roe v. Wade, but consumers aren't convinced business and politics mix.Nearly half (48%) of Americans want companies to encourage consumers to take political actions like voting or writing to congress, but…Fewer than two-in-five (39%) consumers believe companies, themselves, should comment on political topics in the news.Companies should play politics with caution.44% of consumers will actually stop or reduce purchasing from companies that publicly comment on a political topic with a view that is the opposite of their own.Reputation leaders As part of the report, the strategic communications company has developed a Better Business Matrix. This ranks the reputational leaders by industry, in eight key sectors, mapped to highlight the beneficial impact of Purpose on brand value. It also enables companies to self-diagnose their own reputation, based on the key criterion described in the report. Companies that performed the best within their industries include:Automotive - ToyotaCommunications - T-MobileFinancial Services - TIAAFood &amp; Beverage - PepsiCoTech - IntelRetail - REISandy Skees, Purpose &amp; Impact lead from Porter Novelli, added: ""The landscape is shifting rapidly, and this report highlights the changing expectations around sustainability and DEI as examples of purpose in action.  The Porter Novelli Better Business matrix is about ensuring companies know how to decode and deliver on environmental and social progress – as well as avoiding the pitfalls of political overreach.""The Purpose Priorities Report analyzed the reputation of 200 top companies listed in the Fortune 100, Fortune Best Companies to Work For, World's Most Ethical and the DiversityInc., among others.""For the past 30 years, Porter Novelli has sought to understand the role of Purpose in company performance,"" says Andrea List, senior vice president of Data &amp; Insights, the report's lead author. ""In that time, the imperative to authentically address social and environmental issues has only grown stronger. This study continues to demonstrate that no corporate reputation can thrive without Purpose.""About the StudyThe Purpose Priorities Report presents the findings of an online survey designed and executed in August 2022 among an online sample of 7,000 American adults, ages 18+.

(NYSE: FE) electric companies Ohio Edison and The Illuminating Company are completing smart grid upgrades across Ashtabula County to help prevent or minimize the length of service disruptions, particularly during severe weather. The work includes installation of new, automated equipment and technology in substations and along power lines serving nearly 18,000 customers in parts of Ashtabula, Austinburg, Andover, Geneva and nearby areas. Upgrades began in 2020 under the company's initial three-year portfolio of grid modernization work.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Every project is customized and designed to address the particular reliability needs of each community,"" said Ed Shuttleworth, president of FirstEnergy's Ohio operations. ""These upgrades will allow us to restore service to our customers faster following severe weather events as well as pave the way for a more robust power system to support different types of energy sources in the years to come.""Utility personnel are finalizing electrical equipment upgrades in four substations in the greater Ashtabula area and modernizing power lines that deliver electric service to customers from those facilities. Thousands of homes and businesses in the area will benefit from the installation of 52 new automated reclosing devices in the substations and along power lines to help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions.These electrical devices work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs, with the added benefit of automatically reenergizing a substation or power line within seconds for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers. This technology is safer and more efficient because it often allows utility personnel to automatically restore service to customers in lieu of sending a crew to investigate.Story continuesIf the device senses a more serious issue, like a fallen tree on electrical equipment, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers. The device's smart technology will quickly pinpoint the location of the fault and help utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Locations for these automated devices were determined based on a review of historical outage patterns across greater Ashtabula to identify the areas that could benefit most from new technology.Additional power lines that tie together existing circuits are also being constructed to provide more flexibility in restoring service following outages. The new power lines will help reduce the length of power outages and the overall number of customers impacted by switching them to a backup line for faster service restoration.Lastly, 50 capacitor banks were installed to regulate voltage, helping provide energy savings by reducing the amount of electricity that must be generated and evenly distributing electricity to allow all customers served by a single power line to receive the same flow of safe, reliable power. Beyond the company's investments in power lines and equipment, Ohio Edison and The Illuminating Company have installed more than 20,000 smart meters for customers in Ashtabula County since 2020. As the latest in metering technology, smart meters enable customers to better track their energy consumption and minimize estimated readings. Smart meters also can be leveraged by customers electing to enroll in programs like time-varying rates, which can provide price incentives to reduce electricity use during high demand periods throughout the day.FirstEnergy's Ohio utilities, including Ohio Edison and The Illuminating Company, recently filed a plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) that would expand smart grid technology investments. The filing, known as Ohio Grid Mod II, proposes a four-year, $626 million investment plan that builds upon system upgrades completed since the PUCO approved the utilities' Grid Mod I plan in 2019.In addition to power infrastructure upgrades, the proposed plan also includes several pilot programs that could provide enhanced customer benefits, such as providing residential and non-residential electric vehicle managed charging incentives to help support the adoption of electric vehicles across the company's Ohio service territories.

Many people are also thinking about cleaning up their yards before the weather changes to make room for holiday decorations by trimming bushes and removing dead trees. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) has seen more than 100 incidents where trees or tree limbs have fallen into powerlines by either the homeowner conducting tree work or by the homeowner’s hired tree crew. These incidents are the type of situation that can cause outages and lead to ignitions.""We are seeing an increase in tree branches coming down onto powerlines during tree work and whether you’re a licensed tree crew, logger, harvest plan owner or landowner, we encourage you to call us before you trim or fell trees near powerlines,"" said Andrew Abranches, Senior Director for PG&amp;E’s Wildfire Risk Management Team.The phone number to call is (800) 564-5080. Here are additional tips for residential and business customers to practice safe tree trimming and removal.BEFORE WORKING NEAR POWERLINES:Call PG&amp;E to request a safety evaluation of the area. PG&amp;E will ensure it is safe to fell a tree in that area, either by de-energizing the line or it might be a situation where PG&amp;E will schedule its contractor to do the work.It is unlawful to work within 10 feet of a distribution or a transmission line without calling the utility.If a tree or limb contacts the power line, stay away and immediately call 911 and then call PG&amp;E. Do not attempt to remove the tree or limb from the line.PG&amp;E follows all applicable federal and state vegetation clearance requirements by performing regular trimming and removal of approximately along its 100,000 miles of electric lines. That includes inspecting and monitoring every PG&amp;E overhead electric transmission and distribution line each year, with some locations patrolled multiple times.Story continuesFor information about safely planting and trimming trees, visit www.pge.com/powerlinesafety.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Because high winds may cause trees and debris to contact energized lines and possibly start a wildfire, PG&amp;E may need to turn off power during dry, windy weather.Each year, PG&amp;E enhances the PSPS program by further refining the ability to identify and mitigate catastrophic wildfire risk. There was an 88% reduction in customers impacted by PSPS in 2021 compared to 2020, and a 43% reduction in the duration of outages during a PSPS in 2021 compared to 2019.""System improvements and favorable weather meant that PSPS affected fewer customers last year than in 2020 and 2019,"" said Mark Quinlan, Vice President of Electric System Operations at PG&amp;E. ""PG&amp;E continues to use PSPS as a last resort to prevent catastrophic wildfires. Every day, PG&amp;E is working hard to respond to the state’s changing climate, reduce wildfire risk across every part of the service territory and make the system safer.""This year, PG&amp;E is providing customers with several tools to help them prepare and stay safe during a planned power outage:The Generator and Battery Rebate Program has expanded to provide a $300 rebate to customers located in Tier 2 or 3 High Fire-Threat Districts (HFTD) and/or served by an Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings (EPSS)-protected circuit. If the customer is located outside of an HFTD but is served by an EPSS-capable circuit, they must have experienced two or more recent PSPS to qualify.Hotel discounts are now available as a new resource for customers who are experiencing a PSPS. PG&amp;E is teaming up with IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, Hyatt, Choice, and Wyndham Hotels to offer customers discounted rooms as a safe space during a power outage.Transportation to Community Resource Centers (CRCs) has been expanded to provide accessible transportation to and from CRCs to customers in Shasta, El Dorado, Fresno, Marin, Sonoma, Solano, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Tuolumne, Amador, Calaveras, and San Francisco Counties during a PSPS.Customers who depend on power for medical devices or assistive technologies may qualify for the Disability Disaster Access and Resources (DDAR) Program, a collaboration between PG&amp;E and the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers. The program assists those who have medical and independent living needs with:Creating an emergency planSigning up for the Medical Baseline ProgramApplying for a portable backup batteryObtaining ADA-accessible car rides and/or hotel stays during a PSPSReceiving food replacement during and after a PSPSStory continuesCustomer NotificationsPG&amp;E shares information in advance of and during PSPS outages as soon as possible. New this year, notifications will be sent both day and night, depending on when the dry, windy weather occurs and power will be out. PG&amp;E understands this may mean customers are called at night and recognizes the inconvenience this may pose. In previous years, PG&amp;E has not sent notifications between the hours of 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. However, due to requirements from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the policy has been updated. Although weather conditions can be uncertain, PG&amp;E aims to send notifications via calls, texts and emails two days ahead of a PSPS, one day ahead, just before shutting off power, once power is turned off and daily until power is restored. PG&amp;E will also send notifications if a PSPS outage is no longer expected. Customers can ensure their contact information is current by visiting pge.com/myalerts.Address AlertsCustomers can receive PSPS notifications for any important address such as their parents’ home, their children’s school or their business via text or phone call in 16 languages. Customers and non-account holders can sign up for Address Alerts at pge.com/addressalerts.Wildfire Safety Video HubTo help customers prepare for possible emergencies due to increasing wildfire risk, PG&amp;E is expanding its wildfire safety and preparedness online toolkit. A new online Wildfire Safety Videos hub serves as a one-stop shop with easy-to-navigate videos about customer support and wildfire safety initiatives.An in-depth look at customer resources before, during and after a PSPS is available at pge.com/pspsresources.

Inflation remains high, interest rates keep climbing, as does the risk of a recession. Yet while overall market sentiment remains deeply negative, there is opportunity to seize, with cheap large-cap stocks to buy.Not only has it been speculative and growth-focused stocks that have hit lower prices following the latest rounds of market volatility. Even more defensive names, as well as stocks benefiting from current trends (commodities stocks) have been been bid down to lower prices.This has created the ability to scoop up many high-quality large-cap stocks at very favorable valuations. Made cheaper by external factors, once these issues clear up, these undervalued but fundamentally superior stocks are well-positioned to make a rapid recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the story here, with these seven large-cap stocks to buy. Earning either an A or B in Portfolio Grader, consider now a great time to enter/add to a position.AMXAmerica Movil SAB de CV$16.86CNQCanadian Natural Resources$49.63MOSMosaic Company$49.20MROMarathon Oil$24.61PBRPetroleo Brasileiro S.A.$13.76SUSuncor Energy$30.34TSTenaris S.A.$27.82America Movil SAB de CV (AMX)A digital illustration of the telecom industry.Source: ShutterstockMexico-based America Movil SAB de CV (NYSE:AMX) is the dominant telecom firm in its home market. It has a 70% and 62% share of the Mexican mobile internet and mobile phone markets, respectively. America Movil also has a substantial presence in Europe, Latin America and the U.S.Holding steady compared to the overall market earlier this year, AMX stock has pulled back in recent months. The aforementioned macro concerns have led investors to shun America Movil shares. However, instead of going with the crowd, you may want to instead take the contrarian view on this stock, which earns a B in Portfolio Grader.Story continuesAs Citi analyst Andres Cardona argued when he upgraded the stock in August, the company’s strong free cash flow points to increased dividends and buybacks. These could help move the AMX stock back higher. A spinoff of its mobile towers business is another potential catalyst.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWith energy prices currently moving lower, the sell-off among oil and gas stocks such as Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) may seem justified. Yet while crude oil prices have fallen back to levels last seen just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (which caused a fossil fuel supply shock), that doesn’t mean the opportunity here with CNQ has come and gone.First, it’s not a given that fossil fuel prices will continue to pull back. In fact, some commodities analysts, including the chief economist of oil trading giant Trafigura, believe that another spike lies ahead next year, due to new supply shocks created by industry underinvestment.Second, as demand could continue to outstrip supply, this energy company is likely to continue using the high profits resulting from high oil and gas prices to pay down debt, buy back stock and issue special dividends.CNQ stock earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Mosaic Company (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith investors declaring the Russia/Ukraine-driven spike in fertilizer prices as temporary, Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) shares have fallen considerably in the past few months.The market currently is pricing this provider of fertilizer ingredients like phosphates and potash as if its recent windfall earnings are going to reverse.But taking a look at the details, so far fertilizer prices have stayed high. While something that would have worsened the supply crisis (destruction of a key fertilizer facility by Hurricane Ian) fortunately did not happen, the key factor keeping supplies tight (sanctions against Russia) continues. This points to prices remaining high, which of course is good news for Mosaic.MOS stock (which earns a B in Portfolio Grader) currently trades for 3.6 times earnings. If the company continues to report similar results, the stock could get out of its current slump, and resume an upwards trajectory.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another situation where the market is overestimating how much the latest energy price trends will affect future results and underappreciating the company’s ability to deliver strong returns to its shareholders.MRO stock trades for only 4.8 times 2022 estimated earnings. Even if Marathon’s earnings per share (or EPS) falls from $4.93 to $4.33 next year (per sell-side forecasts), Marathon still trades at a low valuation (5.4 times earnings).Beyond just the potential for shares to rise on multiple expansion, what could really move the needle for Marathon Oil stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) is management’s decision to return a majority of its cash flow back to investors.Since last October, Marathon has bought back over $2.3 billion worth of shares. While its current dividend (1.36% forward yield) is modest, there’s substantial room for dividend growth.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR)the Petroleo Brasileiro logo on a building during daylightSource: A.PAES / Shutterstock.comBetter known as Petrobras, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE:PBR) is Brazil’s biggest oil company. Recently, this large-cap energy stock has been under pressure and not just because of the pullback in crude oil prices.Brazil’s 2022 Presidential election has also weighed on PBR stock. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who won a plurality of votes in the first round on Oct. 2, has a strong chance of winning the Oct. 30 run-off election. The left-wing candidate’s plans for Petrobras could come at the expense of PBR’s minority shareholders.However, as one sell-side analyst (J.P. Morgan’s Rodolfo Angele) has argued, it’s possible that the prospect of a da Silva victory is already priced-in. I agree with this view, given PBR stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) trades for only 3 times 2022 earnings. If uncertainties about Petrobras’ future resolve, shares could experience an outsized rebound.Suncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy (NYSE:SU) is another of the cheap large-cap stocks to buy in the energy sector. As with the two other energy stocks listed above, Suncor has been pushed to an extremely-discounted valuation.SU stock currently trades for just four times 2022 estimated earnings. Besides the potential for a re-rating, if oil prices remain high, there’s another catalyst in motion. Back in July, Suncor added three directors to its board backed by activist fund Elliott Investment Management.Furthermore, Suncor said it was open to Elliott’s idea of selling its retail gas station chain, Petro-Canada. A sale of Petro-Canada, along with other ideas Elliott has suggested (like enhanced capital return) could enable this stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) to move towards prices more reflective of Suncor’s underlying value. Along with two catalysts to move it higher, SU stock also sports a 5% forward dividend yield.Tenaris S.A. (TS)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockTenaris S.A. (NYSE:TS) is a producer of steel products for the oil and gas industry with operations throughout the world. Tenaris rallied earlier this year, alongside other energy-related stocks on the heels of Russia’s Ukraine invasion.Since then, TS stock has given back these gains, as Russia-related tailwinds have become outweighed by concerns about a global recession. However, the current bearish sentiment for shares works to your advantage.Trading at a low valuation (7.7 times earnings), and sporting a 4.33% forward yield, TS stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) could deliver strong returns for investors buying it today.As Tenaris argued in its Sept. 30. investor presentation,  as demand for fossil fuels will keep rising, even with the shift towards renewable energy, long-term trends remain on the company’s side. This points to continued growth for Tenaris, and a continued move higher for TS stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in CNQ, MRO, PBR, SU and TS.

Selling at an average price of US$332, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Satya Nadella, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$285m worth of shares at a price of US$349 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$247. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in Microsoft than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Microsoft Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Microsoft. In total, insiders sold US$21m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of MicrosoftI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$826m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Microsoft Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Microsoft is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Microsoft. For example - Microsoft has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

MSFT posted quarterly free cash flow of a steep $17.8 billion in its latest quarter, reflecting Y/Y growth of nearly 10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn top of tech exposure, MSFT pays out an annual dividend that yields 1%, nicely above its Zacks Computer and Technology Sector average of 0.9%.Impressively, Microsoft has upped its dividend payout six times over the last five years, carrying a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough a hawkish Federal Reserve has played spoilsport for many tech stocks in 2022, MSFT is still forecasted to grow at a solid pace; earnings are forecasted to climb 9.2% in FY23 and a further double-digit 16% in FY24.The earnings increase comes on top of projected revenue growth of 11% and 13.4% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile selecting stocks is always challenging, a good filter would be focusing on companies with healthy free cash flow.A solid free cash flow speaks volumes about a company’s financial state, telling us if it has sufficient funds to wipe out debt, pay dividends, or buy back stock.For those looking to target stocks with free cash flow strength - Exxon Mobil XOM, Microsoft MSFT, and Pfizer PFE – would all be great places to start.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to White House estimates, the change is expected to save consumers about $2,800 per pair.In a statement to Reuters, CVS Health said it currently has a limited selection of hearing aids available on CVS.com, and it ""plans to add to these offerings and expand to retail stores in the near future.""Hearing aids for severe hearing loss or for users below 18 years of age remain as prescription devices.

79,168557f1-e972-32bb-8bed-d06daefe946e,WBA,2022-10-07,Analysts Estimate Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-walgreens-boots-alliance-140002145.html,1665064802.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 13, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%.Revenues are expected to be $32.49 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?For Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.96, delivering a surprise of +1.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walgreens doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when CEO, Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz bought US$10.0m worth of shares at a price of US$73.10 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$90.12), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 274.75k shares for US$21m. But insiders sold 26.96k shares worth US$3.0m. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Starbucks insiders.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Starbucks Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Starbucks. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$6.0m worth of shares. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Starbucks insiders own 2.1% of the company, currently worth about US$2.1b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Starbucks Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Starbucks insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Looks promising! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Starbucks has 3 warning signs (2 shouldn't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 2022. The performance of cyclical stocks is largely tied to economic recovery. Amid global inflation, threats of recession, and rampant rate hikes, these equities might be trading at a significant discount as investors ignore the potential for global economic rebound.In late July, Courtney Garcia, Payne Capital Market senior wealth advisor, told CNBC that investors should monitor the stock market for the next 6 to 12 months, rather than worry about what happens the next day or week. She believes that inflation will eventually ease, be it at the end of 2022 or next year, and she advised investors to maintain positions in cyclical stocks, in addition to inflation hedges like energy and commodities for a balanced portfolio. As of mid-September, analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that the US might be able to achieve a soft landing, as latest data indicates rebounding growth and bolstered consumer confidence. Markets can rally on the back of government capital stimulus in China and energy transition plans in Europe. Investors in the United States believe that inflation may have peaked, and they look forward to a stock market recovery. This is a positive catalyst for cyclical stocks, as risk appetite in the market will also increase.  Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy in 2022 include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Our Methodology We carried out a detailed assessment of cyclical industries, including restaurants, hotels, home improvement, high-end fashion retailers, and automobile manufacturers. We selected the following stocks based on positive analyst coverage, solid demand, and strong hedge fund sentiment. We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database of about 900 elite hedge funds. Story continues10 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 2022Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 202210. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was founded in 2002 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company owns and operates integrated resorts, with casinos, private gaming salons, luxury hotel towers, health clubs, spas, and pools. The stock has climbed over 20% in the last month as of October 4, and this is primarily attributable to positive news related to relaxation of border restrictions in China. On September 26, Jefferies analyst David Katz upgraded Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $75, up from $62, in light of the Macau government announcing the resumption of visitation access from Mainland China through tours and e-visas by the end of October to early November, calling it ""the moment we've been waiting for."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were long Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 32 funds in the last quarter.

Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.” 9.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC), compared to 28 funds in the earlier quarter worth $330.35 million.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation underperformed due to the longer-than-expected recovery for its Vans brand, elevated freight costs dampening gross margin, and its modest exposure to the slowdown in China. The company’s remaining brands are performing well. Although consolidated results have been choppy, we believe management is making the right strategic decisions for future profitable growth.”8.

The company has more than 3,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. On September 27, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) announced some new tech initiatives it is employing to improve its employee and customer experience. These include AI and machine learning to monitor ingredient levels in real time, autonomous cooking assistants, and advanced location-based tech to enhance app functionality. On September 22, Stephens analyst Joshua Long initiated coverage of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) with an Overweight rating and a $1,900 price target. The analyst views Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) as a ""best-in-class operator"" within the fast casual dining segment that is positioned advantageously to benefit from consumer demand for its brand experience. The company's growth story is ""anchored by the compelling unit economics and continued growth of its digitally-enabled store base,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 39 funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 38 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.10 million shares valued at $1.4 billion. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings specifically said about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) with an Outperform rating and a $144 price target. The analyst expects KFC's cumulative five-year sales from international markets excluding China to drive sales equivalent to the size of China and also likes Taco Bell's brand, digital engagement, and attraction for Gen-Z, while he is on the sidelines about Pizza Hut's outlook. However, he noted that Pizza Hut's ""transformation into a more LSR-ready concept leaves room for upside.""Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 funds were bullish on Yum! Brands, Inc.

90,5a167541-b62c-30a0-9b3d-e09584acc0b8,ADM,2022-10-07,10 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-ethanol-stocks-buy-130635438.html,1665061595,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we discuss 10 best ethanol stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more ethanol stocks, go directly to 5 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now.The increasing emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly products has resulted in a rise in demand for ethanol over the past few years. Ethanol, mainly derived from crops such as sugar, wheat, and corn, can be added to crude products in order to reduce their overall carbon emissions, thus reducing pollution. The price for ethanol is rising as countries shift focus towards the energy transition in the wake of global warming policy initiatives. In the short-term, a poor start to the new corn marketing year and high prices are weighing on the ethanol sector. According to a recent study, the global ethanol market will rise at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5% over the next five years to reach $129 billion in value by 2027. Some of the best ethanol stocks expected to benefit from this boom include Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM). The US remains the largest producer of ethanol because of the ease of availability of raw materials that are required for production.Besides the US, the market in South America is expected to witness considerable growth in the coming years, driven by the presence of several large scale producers of ethanol in the region. The ethanol market is broadly divided into two important ethanol products, synthetic ethanol and bioethanol. The raw materials required for production include kernels and starchy crops biomass, lignocellulosic biomass, Algal biomass, and industrial waste carbon dioxide, in addition to petroleum derived chemicals. Ethanol Industry Outlook for 2022-2023Some of the major industries that make use of ethanol include transportation, energy, and the chemical sectors. Corn-based ethanol production in the US has fallen to unusually low levels in the past few weeks, per data released by the Department of Energy in the country. In the short-term energy outlook, the Energy Information Administration reduced the 2022-23 ethanol outlook to 5.325 billion bushels, slightly below the 5.33 billion estimated for 2021-22. This accounts for 37% of total 2022-23 US corn use, the highest share in four years.Story continuesAccording to the government, US ethanol production will average just a little over 1.01 million barrels per day in 2022, down from the August forecast of 1.02 million barrels per day. Presently, the agency forecasts that ethanol production will average 1 million barrels per day in 2023. For context, ethanol production averaged 980,000 barrels per day in 2021. On a quarterly basis, ethanol production is expected to average 1.01 million barrels per day during the third quarter of 2022, increasing to 1.02 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. In 2023, ethanol production is expected to average 1 million barrels per day in the first and second quarters, falling to 990,000 in the third quarter, and expanding to 1.02 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Fuel ethanol blending is expected to average 910,000 barrels per day in 2022, expanding to 920,000 barrels per day in 2023. Recent traffic trends suggest that fuel demand may be improving, but a subpar US corn crop could disrupt the ethanol industry, especially if harvest results are worse than expected, per news agency Reuters. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the ethanol sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy NowT photography / Shutterstock.comBest Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now10.

The company intends to accelerate Samsung's 3 nanometer (nm) gate-all-around (GAA) technology adoption for its designs that require optimal power, performance and area (PPA).Samsung’s GAA technology defies the performance limitations of FinFET, improving power efficiency by reducing the supply voltage level, while enhancing performance by increasing drive current capability. The first-generation 3nm process can reduce power consumption by up to 45%, improve performance by 23% and reduce the area by 16% while the second-generation 3nm process can reduce power consumption by up to 50%, improve performance by 30% and reduce the area by 35%.With the recent announcement, Synopsys intends to meet the growing demand of customers using mobile, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications by substantially reducing power, improving performance standards and decreasing area levels.Synopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. Price and ConsensusSynopsys, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Synopsys, Inc.

Given the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies. Many of them have selected Synopsys as their primary electronic design automation partner.The latest development strengthens Synopsys’ relationship with Samsung Foundry. In July, the company designed a radio frequency (RF) design reference flow and design solutions kit on Samsung Foundry's 8nm RF low-power FinFET process, in collaboration with the Pennsylvania-based engineering simulation software developer Ansys ANSS.In June, Synopsys launched an integrated RF Design Reference Flow solution, collaborating with Keysight Technologies KEYS and Ansys for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s TSM N6RF process that accelerates 5G performance and power efficiency.Story continuesThe TSMC RF Design Reference Flow comprises Synopsys' Custom Compiler, PrimeSim, StarRC and IC Validator solutions, and Keysight's PathWave RFPro for EM simulation. It also includes Ansys' VeloceRF, RaptorX and RaptorH solutions, and Totem-SC products.In April, Samsung Foundry, the Korean semiconductor manufacturer, adopted an advanced voltage-timing signoff solution, developed jointly by Synopsys and Ansys. In July 2021, Synopsys partnered with Samsung Foundry on its VC Functional Safety Manager solution to accelerate the time to achieve ISO 26262 compliance for automotive SOCs.Currently, Keysight flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Are there truly any recession-proof stocks? Well, recessions do pull almost every stock lower, so it’s very difficult to find completely recession-proof stocks. But there are stocks that perform fairly well during economic downturns. And investors should be looking to buy those stocks now. Because depending on one’s outlook, we are either quickly headed toward a recession or we’re already in one. The Fed ratcheted its benchmark interest rate target 75 basis points higher on Sept. 21. That hike was the third consecutive 75 basis point hike by the central bank, and the benchmark rate will likely rise above 4.25%. The Fed’s previous attempts to reduce inflation have drawn mixed results,  prompting it to raise interest rates further. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, the move could trigger additional, sharp declines by the stock market and a deep recession. As a result, investors should look to buy nearly recession-proof stocks in October. NAPADuckhorn Portfolio$14.11ORLYO’Reilly Automotive$718.20MCDMcDonald’s$235.35KMBKimberly-Clark$114.10JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.20SNPSSynopsys$317ULTAUlta Beauty$404.75Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA)I’ve never written about Duckhorn Portfolio (NYSE:NAPA) before. However, I think it’s interesting for a few reasons. First, data suggests that alcohol consumption increases in recessionary periods. One study shows that, in the 2008-2009 recession, total alcohol consumption increased even as rates of abstinence from alcohol increased. In other words, precedent suggests that those who drink tend to drink much more in a recession. Further, wine is emerging as an interesting alternative investment alongside other luxury items such as fine art. The idea behind investing in luxury goods during recessions is that the demand for them does not drop much during economic downturns. Duckhorn Portfolio offers wines that cost between  $50 and $200 per bottle. Its wines aren’t tremendously expensive, but they are definitely luxuries. Story continuesDuckhorn Portfolio’s most recent results indicate that the company is relatively mature, as its sales increased only 1.3% year-over-year to $91.6 million. That increase isn’t especially exciting for investors. However, it is a safe company with a firm business. For that reason, along with its status as a seller of a luxury product, I’d consider investing in NAPA stock. O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)It’s fairly obvious why O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), which sells auto parts, should do well in a recession. That’s because, during the current economic downturn,  Americans are keeping their vehicles for longer than they ever have. Back in May, it was reported that the average age of vehicles in the U.S. had reached 12.2 years. That was a new record. The older a vehicle becomes, the more repairs it requires. So O’Reilly Automotive should benefit from strong demand dynamics. Additionally, Americans are increasingly seeing their ability to save dwindle as inflation continues to pinch consumers. That increases the chances of them hanging on to older vehicles longer, raising the demand for O’Reilly Automotive’s products. In late July, O’Reilly Automotive provided guidance for a 3% to 5%  increase in its 2022 comparable store sales   Fortunately for investors, analysts’ average price  target still indicates that ORLY stock can rise much further. McDonald’s (MCD)Let’s begin with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) fundamentals. McDonald’s is growing at an impressive rate, especially for a company of its size. In its most recent reported quarter, the company’s global comparable sales increased 9.7%  year-over-year while its U.S. comparable sales climbed 3.7% during the same period. Those fundamentals suggest McDonald’s remains on firm footing. That’s a positive for investors. But investors must also consider McDonald’s trajectory in a recession. Fortunately, it is one of the better-known defensive stocks. MCD stock held its value during the 2008-2009 recession trading around $58 for the duration. And over the last ten years, it has performed very well, providing 14% average annual returns for investors, not including its dividend. That dividend is extremely safe, having last been reduced in 1977. Consider MCD stock for its performance, its inexpensive menu offerings that should perform well as purse strings tighten, and its dividend that is just about guaranteed. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Investors should seriously consider Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock to appease some of their recession concerns. Let’s begin with a simple argument that relies on price precedents for Kimberly-Clark. Over the past three years, Kimberly-Clark stock has traded in a range around the $130 level. It has gone higher, but for the most part, investors can expect that it will remain at or above that $130 range. In fact,  analysts’ average price target for the shares sits at $131.44. The issue for Kimberly-Clark is one common to most businesses currently: higher costs. In fact, the firm reported that its costs increased by $405 million in the most recent reported quarter. That has some investors worried and is evidenced by the average rating on KMB stock which is a “hold.” But at the same time, Kimberly-Clark beat analysts’ average EPS estimates in the quarter as well. Apparently, the firm is handling those higher costs in an effective manner. I’d buy KMB stock on that notion and because it includes a quarterly dividend of $1.16. It’s a well-known defensive stock within a consumer staples sector that historically enjoys inelastic demand. For those reasons, KMB’s shares are worth considering. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)The reasons to invest in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are simple. In this case, as in others, simple is best. The healthcare sector is noted for its recessionary strengths. Healthcare, as a whole, has tended to outperform during recessions of the past. That will very likely be true this time around as well. In fact, there’s already a lot of evidence supporting this notion. Just look at JNJ stock’s price in 2022. It has barely slipped, falling a minuscule 4.6% thus far. Analysts, on average, believe it can climb roughly $20 above its current price. Like any of the so-called dividend kings – companies that have raised their dividend for 50 or more years – also consider JNJ stock for the income that it provides. Finally, consider JNJ stock because the company, like all successful firms,  invests prudently. That truth is evidenced by its return on invested capital of 17.38%. That ROIC far exceeds the firm’s weighted average cost of capital of 5.83%. When ROIC exceeds WACC, value is created for shareholders. That’s why JNJ remains steady in unsteady times and how JNJ has provided investors with a growing dividend since 1963. Synopsys (SNPS)Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock is a semiconductor firm that is heavily invested in the evolution towards the internet of things. It markets itself as a provider of high-tech chips that power everything from self-driving vehicles to machine learning, to the internet of things, and more. Investors should be interested in SNPS stock because of its fundamentals. In its most recent, reported quarter, the company posted revenue of $1.248 billion, up from $1.057 billion during the same period a year earlier. Synopsys also provided guidance for similar revenue in current quarter. It expects sales of between $5.06 and $5.09 billion for the full year. Semiconductor stocks haven’t performed well in 2022. The PHLX Semiconductor Index has declined nearly  40% in2022. Synopsys looks like an outlier within the sector. because its revenues and net income increased in the first half of 2022 and in Q2. As a result, its shares have only declined by 14% this year. It is riskier than the stocks in other sectors, but SNPS stock has the potential to be a chip stock that performs well in a recession. Wall Street analysts, on aver age, have a “buy” rating on the shares.   That alone is a strong signal as tech and semiconductor industries have been roiled by the swift changes in  monetary policy. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)The case for investing in Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) stock relies upon the notion that demand for its products is relatively inelastic. Past recessions have yielded data suggesting that the demand for cosmetics remains relatively strong during recessions. More specifically, data shows that, during recessions,  women will indulge in discretionary purchases that aren’t too extravagant. Among these purchases are lipstick and other cosmetics. this phenomenon has been referred to as the ‘Lipstick Effect’.That notion seems to have been illustrated by Ulta Beauty’s recent earnings report. If you’re like me and believe that we’re currently in recession, then the fact that Ulta’s sales increased to $2.3 billion from $2 billion bodes well. That suggests that its beauty products are indeed performing well even as consumers continue to become increasingly stretched. Additionally, Ulta Beauty’s revenues have grown very in the past few years. For roughly the firsts even months of 2020, the firm recorded $2.4 billion of  sales. During the same period two years later the company reported $4.64 billion of sales. It’s clear that consumers appreciate its product offerings. And data suggests that cosmetics benefit from inelastic demand, so buying ULTA stock is a wise choice. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It takes courage to buy them at these times, but the rewards can be substantial if appreciation occurs, along with the huge dividend yields locked in for the long term.These three well-known real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been out of favor in 2022, and their dividend yields are now well above their five-year averages.Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT that owns and leases shopping malls, restaurants, outlet centers and entertainment venues.Simon Property Group has been a leading retail REIT for decades. Eleven months ago, Simon Property Group was trading at $160. But 2022 has seen a huge sell-off in quality REIT stocks with inflation, interest rate hikes and fears of a recession so predominant. September was particularly rough as Simon Property Group’s stock fell to a low of $86.02. It has since recovered to trade at $95.87.The annual dividend of $7 per share now yields 7.3%, or 25% above its five-year average of 5.84%. For investors looking for a stable long-term REIT with a huge dividend yield going forward, Simon Property Group could be a winner.Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX) is a Paramus, New Jersey-based retail REIT that leases, manages and develops commercial properties in the New York City metropolitan area.The quarterly dividend of $4.50 was raised from $4.25 in 2018 and has remained stable ever since. There were no cuts nor elimination of the dividend during the COVID-19 pandemic.The 52-week range for Alexander’s is $205 to $299.99, and its most recent price was near $213.50.Like Simon Property Group, September was a down month for Alexander’s stock, pushing up the annual dividend of $18 per share to yield 8.43%. With a five-year average yield of 6%, Alexander’s could be a real income bargain at this level.Story continuesVornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is a New York City-based office REIT that owns and manages nearly 26 million square feet of office buildings in the nation’s largest cities, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.Vornado Realty Trust celebrated its 60th year of trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2022, so it’s clearly a well-established company. Yet spiking interest rates and recessionary fears have brought down its price like so many other REITs this year. The 52-week price range for Vornado Realty Trust is $22.83 to $47.26, and the stock touched its low within the past week.Vornado Realty Trust has beaten the analysts’ estimates over the past two quarters, and its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) numbers have been improving. But the market only seems to care about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s next move or two on interest rates.Although the five-year average dividend yield is 4.96%, the present yield on the $2.12 annual dividend is an incredible 8.8%. The quarterly dividend was cut from 66 cents to 53 cents in August 2020 but has remained stable since that time.

If you want to read about some more financial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now.Unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the past few years have helped finance stocks demonstrate their ability to be resilient during times of crisis, boosting investor confidence and resulting in a flurry of new activity in the sector. However, per research firm Deloitte, the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of regional or global recession in 2023 still loom as near-term challenges for the industry, as more regulation and requirements around transparency also become marketplace realities. Some of the best finance stocks to monitor in this macro environment include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). As rising interest rates increase the earnings of banks overnight, recession fears continue to make investors think twice about investments in the sector. In this context, banks are leaning on the lessons learned from the uncertainty of the past few years to focus on smart strategy and execution that relies on talent, technology, risk, and purpose to drive growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the financial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Best Financial Stocks To Buy NowInvestments, FinanceBest Financial Stocks To Buy Now14. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29   Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The company recently said it resolved technical issues that had prevented US bank account users from making payments or withdrawals for most of the day. The firm has been on a downward spiral in the last few weeks on the back of worsening crypto futures even as analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto technology. Story continuesOn September 14, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained a Neutral rating on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock and raised the price target to $78 from $64, highlighting that Coinbase has a substantial revenue opportunity that originates from higher interest rates.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $2.3 billion. Just like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US. It is one of the top financial stocks to invest in. Reports indicate that a recent phishing campaign has targeted the bank's new partnership with verification service Authentify. In the campaign, thousands of scam emails were sent to the bank's customers to try and trick them into uploading images of their identification cards. On September 26. Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker maintained a Neutral rating on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $125, noting that the rapid rise in Fed funds combined with outsized loan growth has led to a significant increase in funding costs for digitally-based depositories. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), with 7.85 million shares worth more than $818 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a financial holding company that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals. It is one of the premier financial stocks to invest in. In August 2022, the company filed with the SEC to launch six ESG ETFs, the first foray into the US ETF space since the pioneering WEBS products were introduced in the 1990s. The proposed ETFs are likely to be listed in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in early 2023.On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stock and lowered the price target to $92 from $105. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with 13.98 million shares worth more than $1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is one of the world’s leading investment banks and wealth management firms. As the company has grown its wealth management business its earnings have become more predictable and valuable. The management team is very shareholder-friendly, allocating funds not needed to grow the business to repurchase shares and raise their dividend. In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide.

(NYSE:FIS), compared to 68 in the preceding quarter worth $3.95 billion. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a financial institution that provides a range of financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It is one of the most prominent financial stocks to invest in. The bank recently announced that it was expanding Transaction Banking to the European Union. Originally launched in the US in 2020 and expanded to the UK in 2021, this growth aims to deepen the relationships with existing clients who have banking needs in the EU. On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), compared to 71 the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement.

(NYSE:SQ) stock and lowered the price target to $125 from $135, noting that the company's Q2 results were fine, but lacked the pop of quarters past.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Wells Fargo.”8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82     Citigroup Inc.

(NYSE:C), compared to 88 in the previous quarter worth $8.1 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Captital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83    Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services.

S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84  S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. The firm recently announced that it had partnered with Tradeweb Markets, a global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets to introduce electronic connectivity between primary and secondary markets.On August 29, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau maintained an Outperform rating on S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:JPM), S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

104,5e47e696-6ce5-3bd1-a1c2-4b6f3e08cc74,SLB,2022-10-07,Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limiteds-nyse-slb-stock-120048686.html,1665144048,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 24% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Schlumberger's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:16% = US$2.7b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo start with, Schlumberger's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. For this reason, Schlumberger's five year net income decline of 6.2% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Schlumberger's performance with the industry and found thatSchlumberger's performance is depressing even when compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 4.6% in the same period, which is a slower than the company.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SLB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Schlumberger Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In spite of a normal LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 30% (that is, a retention ratio of 70%), the fact that Schlumberger's earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Schlumberger has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 24%. However, Schlumberger's ROE is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Schlumberger has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This world's largest oilfield services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 15.63%.For the last reported quarter, Schlumberger came out with earnings of $0.50 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.40 per share, representing a surprise of 25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.34 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.25%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Schlumberger lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesSchlumberger has an Earnings ESP of +1.05% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 21, 2022.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 4.7% gain over the past four weeks.The recent surge in oil prices, as OPEC and its allies have agreed for steep oil production cuts, primarily drove the stock. Higher oil price will continue to drive exploration and production activities. This in turn will increase demand for oilfield services of Schlumberger.This world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +50%. Revenues are expected to be $7.1 billion, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Schlumberger, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on SLB going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$146 and falling to the lows of US$112. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Packaging Corporation of America's current trading price of US$116 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Packaging Corporation of America’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America What Is Packaging Corporation of America Worth?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 10.63x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 12.75x, which means if you buy Packaging Corporation of America today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Packaging Corporation of America should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, it seems like Packaging Corporation of America’s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Packaging Corporation of America generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 4.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? PKG’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at PKG? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PKG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The TJX Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 drug companies in the world in 2022.While major pharmaceutical companies have always been derided for considering profits over the well-being of the general population, even earning the moniker of ""Big Pharma"" denoting a shadow organization of the major players in the pharma industry. This is especially relevant in the United States, where prices of drugs are not regulated by the government, allowing the companies to exploit the general population, with perhaps the most infamous such occurring in 2015, when Turing Pharmaceutical's CEO, Martin Shkreli, increase the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000%, from $13.5 a pill to $750. However, the past two years have gone a long way in improving the image of the drug and pharma industry.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the infection and death rate kept increasing exponentially week after week, most countries were at a loss on what to do since this was unlike anything they had prepared for. Immediately, pharma companies started to begin research on developing a vaccine against the coronavirus, but there was little expectation that any meaningful achievement would be managed quickly, especially considering that vaccines can take up to a decade for proper development and sometimes not even then, as evidenced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS as its more popularly known. While the virus first emerged in 2003, there has still been no vaccine developed for it.5 Best Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2022Photo by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashDespite the enormity of the task, to battle the worst pandemic in a decade, some of the biggest drug companies in the world began researching potential vaccines and a year after the virus first emerged, the first vaccine obtained emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 1.5 years down the rate, and the worst of the pandemic seems behind us as billions across the world have been inoculated against the deadly virus.Story continuesWhile many believe that pharma companies had a bumper year after the pandemic as more and more people got sick, the truth is quite different. Many pharma companies saw revenues declining significantly in the wake of the pandemic as global supply chains were completely disrupted. Remember, most multinational companies have production sites which serve multiple markets and with supply chains and logistics disrupted, it was harder to accurately predict supply. This, combined with unpredictable customer behaviors meant that many companies ended up falling below their expected targets.Most of the biggest drug companies in the world operate in the United States, even if their country of incorporation is elsewhere. In fact, the drug industry is set to be worth more than $1.7 trillion by 2025, with just United States and China accounting for more than half the market share. By the way, you can click to following link to see the list of 25 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world in 2021.To determine 2022's biggest players in the drug industry, we consulted Fortune Global 500 and annual reports of major companies to arrive at our list. Even Fortune 500 isn't completely accurate at times, for example, listing China Resources Group in the pharmaceutical industry, even though its actually a holding company with subsidiaries in various industries. If we hadn't bifurcated CR Pharmaceuticals, which is the pharmaceutical subsidiary of China Resources Group, our list would have been inaccurate and the top spot would have been incorrectly awarded.

121,f1706f1a-cfab-317c-97aa-e5da6ae7e869,NEM,2022-10-07,7 Stocks to Sell Amid a Commodity Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-sell-amid-commodity-173801333.html,1664818681,STORY,"['X', 'KW=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F', 'LB=F', 'O=F', 'SI=F', 'VMC', 'NUE', 'MP', 'ALB', 'OXY', 'NEM']","[Headline inflation numbers continue to run near their highest levels in 40 years. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 more basis points in September. Analysts are rightly nervous about how long this rising-price period will persist.However, one key sector of the economy is already signaling that the worst of the inflation has already passed. That indicator is commodities. Numerous commodities spiked in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this spring. Agricultural products were particularly impacted.Since then, however, wheat, corn, soybeans and oats, among others, have given back most or all of their post-invasion gains. The price of lumber has slumped by more half from its prior 2022 high. The price of copper, a key metal for electronics and construction, has dove this summer. Precious metals have reversed their prior rally. Oil has fallen back below $100 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLong story short, the surge in commodities is now turning into a crash.It’s unlikely that prices will return all the way to pre-pandemic levels. However, the commodity boom we saw in March 2022 also appears to have gotten significantly out of hand. That being the case, investors should be prepared to lock in gains on commodity stock positions. Here are seven commodity-related stocks to sell before the end of 2022.NUENucor$114.61MPMP Materials$28.85XU.S. Steel$19.58ALBAlbemarle$271.58NEMNewmont$43.86VMCVulcan Materials$160.32OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.34Nucor (NUE)Nucor logo close-up on website page. NUE stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockSteelmaker Nucor (NYSE:NUE) sent shockwaves through its industry earlier in September. The company updated its guidance for Q3 of this year, with the revised figure coming in well below the market’s prior expectations. Now, Nucor envisions earning roughly $6.35 per share in the current quarter. That’s a massive drop from the $9.67 per share it earned last quarter.Story continuesNucor pointed to falling profit margins and reduced shipping volumes for product compared to past periods. This gets back to the bigger issue with steel. It’s a massively boom-bust industry, with players going from record profits to outright losses over and over.Investors tend to fixate on the high profit numbers. NUE stock is trading at roughly five times this year’s estimated earnings, which might sound like a steal. But analysts expect profits to drop by nearly two-thirds over the next two years. The falling demand for housing, autos and other big-ticket items after a record 2021 will hit cyclical players such as steel producers hard.Nucor will be a buy again once the economy stabilizes, but for now, it’s wise to avoid the stock until earnings stop sliding.MP Materials (MP)Best rare earth stocks: a pile of rare earth metalsSource: Joaquin Corbalan P / ShutterstockMP Materials (NYSE:MP) is a mining company focused on rare earth materials such as neodymium. You may remember the company as Molycorp. That predecessor firm had a stock that went up tenfold at one point but ultimately went bankrupt in 2015 when the commodity cycle turned south.MP Materials grabbed Molycorp’s mine out of bankruptcy and is now publicly traded following a SPAC deal. Once again, traders have gravitated to MP stock, thanks to geopolitical uncertainty with China. Rare earth materials are in (relatively) short supply, and having a U.S.-based mine could be a strategic asset.However, price plays a key role. MP stock is still trading at three times its initial SPAC offering price. That’s a rather lofty valuation compared to almost all other SPACs as of late. Meanwhile, the price of neodymium has fallen by nearly half since its February peak. Combine a weakening profit outlook with the fading momentum for mining stocks and MP shares could give back much of their gains.United States Steel (X)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor is far from the only steel stock vulnerable to a downturn in pricing and demand. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stands out as another industry player that traders should sell now.Historically, U.S. Steel has been even more of a boom-bust entity than Nucor since it has a higher cost profile. U.S. Steel has had various years where it lost money during down cycles. Analysts expect big problems for the company once again. Current analyst forecasts suggest the firm’s profits will drop 26% this year, plunge 70% next year, and fall another 39% in 2024. All told, that would take the company’s earnings from more than $15 per share on a trailing basis to less than $2 per share by 2024.A lot of traders see X stock going for less than two times trailing earnings and think the stock must be the deal of the century. But those earnings were exceptionally temporary in nature. With the economy turning south, energy prices rising and demand from China looking sluggish, look for U.S. Steel’s recent prosperity to come to an abrupt end.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comUnlike most of the other stocks on the list, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is still enjoying peak enthusiasm. In fact, ALB stock hit new 52-week highs in September.On the face of it, everything seems to be going right for the gigantic lithium producer. Lithium demand is surging thanks to electric vehicles and other renewable power applications which require batteries. The recent Inflation Reduction Act should provide further subsidies to drive adoption. And the nation of Chile, where Albemarle has extensive operations, just rejected a proposed anti-business constitutional reform process.So what’s not to like?For one thing, shares have already run up 15% this year. 15 times earnings doesn’t seem excessive, but earnings may come under pressure as additional supplies of lithium come online. Additionally, the current electricity squeeze we’re seeing in various markets such as Europe and California may slow down the momentum for electric vehicles a bit. Albemarle is a good company. But shares are prone to a technical correction here, especially as commodity stocks in general are in a broad selloff.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is one of the world’s largest precious metals mining companies. To that point, it has more than 92 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.Unfortunately for investors, the bull case around gold has failed to play out as expected. With the surge in inflation, gold and silver were supposed to soar to new heights. Instead, they rallied modestly and then sputtered out. If gold can’t work as an inflation hedge now, amid unprecedented rising prices, when is it going to pan out?Meanwhile, even after the sharp decline in the price of NEM stock, shares still aren’t cheap. Newmont is currently going for around 18 times this year’s estimated earnings. And analysts see earnings dropping in both 2o22 and 2023. Bulls can point to the company’s 5% dividend yield as a saving grace. But with earnings forecast to come in around $2.50 per share this year, there’s little margin of error for Newmont’s current dividend. With precious metals falling, profits stagnant, and a possible dividend cut on the horizon, Newmont is a sell today.Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is a leading producer of aggregates that are used in construction. Building materials have been a great place to be over the past year. Vulcan sells into the housing market, which was scorching hot until a few months ago. It’s also big in providing materials used in road construction; this area gained investor enthusiasm thanks to the passage of the federal infrastructure package.Vulcan is a better business than it might seem like due to geographical advantages. Namely, aggregates are exceptionally heavy and thus it’s not cost-effective to ship them far. As a result, Vulcan often tends to have monopolies on local markets and get good pricing power when it sells products.However, there are limits to how much this sort of business is worth. And VMC stock is currently testing said limits. At 30x this year’s estimated earnings, Vulcan stock is going at a hefty premium for a company that sells concrete, asphalt and other such basic goods. Throw in a slowing housing market, and Vulcan shares seem set to deflate a bit from their currently lofty perch.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlmost all of the major oil and gas stocks look cheap based on their current earnings outlooks. Despite big gains in their share prices over the past 18 months, oil stocks still seem like reasonable bets to close out 2022.But not all oil companies are created equal. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is infamous for its questionable capital allocation decisions. Specifically, its move to overpay when acquiring Anadarko in 2019 led the company to a liquidity crunch. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stepped in with financing for Occidental at the time and has made a small fortune off that prescient move.Fast forward to today and Berkshire continues adding to its stake in Occidental. This may make sense from Buffett’s position as a large shareholder that can influence the business.For minority shareholders, however, Occidental remains a company with an unimpressive track record and a fairly middling collection of oil assets. With oil prices now backing off their recent peak, this is a great time to rotate out of a riskier oil stock like Occidental and into more trustworthy ones with greater operational stability.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BRK-B stock.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Target Corp. TGT, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Walmart Inc. WMT and Macy's, Inc. MHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Can Retailers Bounce Back on Holiday Season Shopping Spree?Soaring commodity prices have made people spend cautiously, which has been impacting the retail sector. Sales have been slowing and that is worrying retailers. However, even then, they are banking heavily on the upcoming holiday season, which like every year, is expected to boost retail sales.Retailers are thus leaving no stone unturned to make the most of the holiday season. Although the sector is faced with several challenges, including soaring commodity prices, retailers are trying their best to ramp up sales during this period. Several retailers this year plan to launch early holiday deals, while others are on a hiring spree to meet the surge in demand during that period.Aggressive HiringThe retail sector has been struggling with sales slowing month over month for quite some time. However, a modest but 0.4% jump in retail sales in August ahead of the holiday season is a good sign for the worried retailers. Although rising prices have been impacting retail sales over the past few months, the sector has still managed to fight back as higher demand for goods has been driving sales.Besides, the industry is facing several other challenges. Supply-chain crisis and higher freight charges are also hindering smooth sales. However, retailers are hopeful for a great holiday season.Holiday season sales account for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers and are one of the most important sales windows. And this holiday season might not be as bad for the retail sector as was initially anticipated. The annual holiday retail estimate from Deloitte predicts a 4-6% increase in retail sales.Story continuesSpending will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion between November and January. Sales during the holiday season last year totaled $1.49 trillion, a 15.1% increase from 2020. Given that everyone is wary about spending this year, the prediction is quite low, but the good thing is that even then, sales are expected to rise quite significantly.This has made retailers optimistic, and they are once again going on a hiring spree. Retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. and Target Corp. will be launching early holiday deals, which will begin in October.Target Corporation plans to hire 10,000 seasonal workers ahead of the holiday season to meet customers' demands during that period. TGT is also back with its 'Target Deals Day' with the aim of luring more customers to buy essentials and must-have products. This time, Target Corporation will start the 'Target Deals Day' on Oct 6, which will continue till Oct 8.Moreover, for those who look for the best deals, TGT is coming up with ""Holiday Price Match Guarantee."" The offer will start on Oct 6 and continue through Dec 24. Target Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. too is aggressively hiring workers for the upcoming holiday season. DKS plans to hire at least 9,000 heads ahead of the holiday season. DICK's Sporting Goods has been doing well despite the sector facing several challenges because of its both strong online and offline presence. Given that a lot of people plan to travel this year, DKS expects sales of its athletic wear to grow during the holiday season.Walmart Inc. has always been a major player during the holiday season. This time it's going to be no different. WMT will be hiring 40,000 workers ahead of the holiday season. Walmart intends to fill in a wide range of positions, from temporary store clerks to full-time, permanent truck drivers. For the holiday season, Walmart will offer more hours to its existing employees.Walmart also unveiled updated return policies and windows, including a return pickup from home option for Walmart+ members for the holiday season.Macy's, Inc. is also keeping pace with other major retailers and is planning to hire thousands of workers for the holiday season. Last week, M said that it was looking to hire more than 41,000 seasonal full- and part-time employees for its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury stores, as well as call centers and supply-chain locations.Macy said that it will start its pay at $15 per hour, with flexible scheduling options that may include voluntary overtime. Employees will receive discounts, and some programs may allow them to make extra money. M also said that most job offers are made within 48 hours and provide information on online and in-person hiring events, bloomingdalesJOBS.com, and bluemercury.com.

That's going to be a pretty good indication because they all have big credit card businesses and they'll give us a very good indication on the consumer,"" Spencer said.Story continuesThe MSCI All Country stock index fell 0.2%, leaving it down about 24% for the year.U.S. PAYROLLSA Reuters poll predicts 250,000 jobs were created in September after rising 315,000 in August, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.7%.""Today, it is the US labor market report, which is likely to paint a picture of some softening, but not to an extent that can be expected to fuel any twist in the rhetoric of US central bankers. Next week, it all comes down to the US inflation release,"" UniCredit analysts said in a note to clients.In Asia, Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.7%, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.2%, weighed partly by a decline in Samsung shares.Hong Kong's Hang Seng was 1.4% lower, with its tech stocks tumbling 3%. Mainland Chinese shares remain closed for the final day of the Golden Week holiday.Fed officials showed no intention of backing down from the most aggressive rate hike campaign in decades, with Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari all emphasising that the inflation fight was ongoing and they were not prepared to change course.Markets currently price in an 85.5% chance of a 75-basis-point increase for next month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and 14.5% odds for a half-point bump.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.8388%.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six major peers, was little changed at 112.117 following a 1.84% two-day rally from a two-week low.Sterling was up 0.4% at $1.12, though still within striking distance of this week's low against the dollar. The euro was little changed at $0.9803.Crude oil on Friday steadied after a rapid climb triggered by OPEC+ output cuts announced this week.Brent crude rose 1% to $95.35 a barrel.

Amid global inflation, threats of recession, and rampant rate hikes, these equities might be trading at a significant discount as investors ignore the potential for global economic rebound.In late July, Courtney Garcia, Payne Capital Market senior wealth advisor, told CNBC that investors should monitor the stock market for the next 6 to 12 months, rather than worry about what happens the next day or week. She believes that inflation will eventually ease, be it at the end of 2022 or next year, and she advised investors to maintain positions in cyclical stocks, in addition to inflation hedges like energy and commodities for a balanced portfolio. As of mid-September, analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that the US might be able to achieve a soft landing, as latest data indicates rebounding growth and bolstered consumer confidence. Markets can rally on the back of government capital stimulus in China and energy transition plans in Europe. Investors in the United States believe that inflation may have peaked, and they look forward to a stock market recovery. This is a positive catalyst for cyclical stocks, as risk appetite in the market will also increase.  Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy in 2022 include Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was founded in 2002 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company owns and operates integrated resorts, with casinos, private gaming salons, luxury hotel towers, health clubs, spas, and pools. The stock has climbed over 20% in the last month as of October 4, and this is primarily attributable to positive news related to relaxation of border restrictions in China. On September 26, Jefferies analyst David Katz upgraded Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $75, up from $62, in light of the Macau government announcing the resumption of visitation access from Mainland China through tours and e-visas by the end of October to early November, calling it ""the moment we've been waiting for."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were long Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 32 funds in the last quarter.

These include AI and machine learning to monitor ingredient levels in real time, autonomous cooking assistants, and advanced location-based tech to enhance app functionality. On September 22, Stephens analyst Joshua Long initiated coverage of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

(NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

ETR recently announced that its Entergy Arkansas subsidiary has got the regulatory nod from the Arkansas Public Service Commission for developing its Driver Solar Project. The 250 megawatt-alternate currents (MWac) solar facility, to be located in Mississippi County, will be ETR’s largest solar facility.Details of The ProjectOnce complete, as expected by late 2024, the Driver Solar facility will be capable of generating enough energy to power more than 40,000 homes. This project will enhance Entergy’s footprint in Northeast Arkansas.The Driver Solar Project will increase electricity supply and enhance voltage levels on the surrounding grid, both of which improve service reliability and availability.Entergy’s Opportunities in ArkansasArkansas installed 177.1 MW of solar in 2021. The solar industry invested $785 million in Arkansas, including $220 million in 2021. This very well reflects the growing solar demand in Arkansas.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), 2,533 MW of solar is projected to be installed in Arkansas over the next five years. This surely offers solid growth opportunities for utilities like Entergy, which already enjoys a solid market share in the state’s solar industry.Notably, Entergy Arkansas purchases energy from or owns three solar facilities:  Stuttgart Solar, Chicot Solar and Searcy Solar for approximately 281 megawatts. It is currently in the process of adding Walnut Bend Solar and West Memphis Solar for another 280 megawatts. In total, Entergy Arkansas will generate 811 megawatts of solar power – enough to operate approximately 130,000 homes. Collectively, these various energy resources will provide Entergy Arkansas with approximately 6,000 megawatts of generating capability to serve its customers in 2024 and beyond, with the Driver Solar project being one of the contributors.Global Clean Energy DriveRealizing the need to proceed toward a carbon-free environment, utilities across the board are rapidly expanding their renewable energy portfolio, not only in Arkansas but worldwide, with solar and wind contributing a major portion to this transition.Story continuesEarlier this year, Entergy Corp issued a request for proposals for 1,000 MW of wind and solar resources. In June 2022, Entergy discussed plans for up to 7 gigawatts of renewable resources by the end of 2025, and as much as 14 to 17 gigawatts of renewable resources by the end of 2031.Entergy Corp. apart, utilities that are poised to grow their renewable energy portfolio to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are as follows:NextEra Energy NEE: It operates more than 16,000 MW of emission-free wind energy. In the span 2021 to 2022, the company expects to bring online an additional 3,700 to 4,400 MW of clean, emission-free wind energy. On the solar front, its Florida Power &amp; Light Company is the largest generator of solar energy in Florida with nearly 40 major solar power plants and numerous other solar installations totaling more than 2,700 MW of solar generation.NextEra Energy has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.7%. NEE shares have risen 1.7% in the past three months.Duke Energy DUK: It has taken an initiative to expand the renewable asset base and aims to reach its target of net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. The company lowered its carbon emissions in 2021 by more than 44% since 2005 and is now expanding its 2050 net-zero goals to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.Duke Energy has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DUK’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 9.3% from the 2021 reported figure.Ameren AEE: It is committed to exploring renewable energy options, such as wind, solar, landfill gas, agricultural methane, hydroelectric and other alternative energy sources, to generate electricity. It has built Missouri's largest investor-owned solar energy center in O'Fallon, MO, which has 19,000 solar panels with a generating capacity of 5.7 MW of electricity.Ameren’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 7.2%.

Competition from alternate sources of energy and compilation costs in a stringent regulatory environment are headwinds.TailwindsIDACORP’s regulated electric operations in Idaho generate a relatively stable and growing income stream. An expanding customer base, improvement in the economic conditions of its service territories and rising demand for clean energy are contributing to its stable performance.IDACORP projects capital expenditure of $2.8 billion for the 2022-2026 period. Owing to systematic investments in strengthening the generation portfolio, Idaho Power Hydroelectric Generation will be able to cater to the rising demand of its expanding customer base. The systematic investment aims to provide 100% clean energy to Idaho Power’s customers by 2045. At 2021-end, of the energy mix, nearly 61% comprised clean energy sources.A sustained focus on cost control has helped the company to keep its rates lower than other electricity providers. The average industrial and residential rates charged by Idaho Power are much lower than the national average. The low cost of energy makes it a favorable destination for investors setting up new businesses in the region, resulting in an increase in demand for electricity. The company attracts new customers as it provides clean energy, affordability and reliability.HeadwindsIDACORP predominantly provides electricity from hydro-electric units. The development of new technology to generate electricity and the decline in the cost of generating clean electricity from other alternative energy sources could adversely impact demand for its services.The company operates in a strict regulatory environment and its nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulations.

139,77d4eff3-239c-3303-9795-0c4773263978,NEE,2022-10-07,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 79% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nyse-nee-130027907.html,1665061227,STORY,['NEE'],"[Every investor in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NextEra Energy. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.NextEra Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NextEra Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. NextEra Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that NextEra Energy, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$272m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in NextEra Energy. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NextEra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - NextEra Energy has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

140,93cf2645-9e41-35c3-96fb-543a9b3b5800,BK,2022-10-07,"Despite delivering investors losses of 14% over the past 5 years, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) has been growing its earnings",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/despite-delivering-investors-losses-14-193619305.html,1665084979,STORY,['BK'],"[For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), since the last five years saw the share price fall 25%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 24%.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Bank of New York Mellon actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 3.4% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, five years ago. Looking to other metrics might better explain the share price change.In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 0.3% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthBank of New York Mellon is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Bank of New York Mellon stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Bank of New York Mellon the TSR over the last 5 years was -14%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Bank of New York Mellon shareholders are down 22% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 18%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Bank of New York Mellon .We will like Bank of New York Mellon better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The adoption of instant payments is expected to increase, both in the U.S. via the RTP® network and the soon-to-be-launched FedNow service, and in Europe and the U.K. with the SEPA Credit Transfer Instant and Faster Payments services.Cryptocurrencies – tipped as a game changer for payments – shows growth mainly forecasted among existing users. Meanwhile, the usage of cash and checks is declining on a net basis, although they are embedded in many businesses' workflows, notably in the U.S.Key findings of the survey include:In North America, and Europe and the U.K., digital wallets are expected to see the most growth in the next 12 months.Among non-users of cryptocurrencies, only 7% of European businesses and 10% of North American businesses intend to utilize them in the near-term.67% of European corporations surveyed are using instant payments, compared to 46% of corporates in North America.86% of European and U.K. non-users of instant payments note that they have some level of interest in using the transaction method in the next 12-24 months, with 68% of non-users in North American in the same camp.76% of North American businesses have used checks in the last 12 months, compared to 61% in Europe.""These study findings show that companies currently embracing emerging payment technologies are already reaping the benefits, while those slower to adopt them need more support to make the switch,"" says Carl Slabicki, Co-Head of Global Payments within Treasury Services at BNY Mellon. ""That is why we are positioning ourselves as gateway for businesses to access all possible payment solutions as quickly and easily as possible.""Story continues""The report paints a picture of a payments landscape that is complex and incredibly varied from region to region,"" said Gilles Ubaghs, author of the study at Aite-Novarica Group. ""No single payment method is emerging as the preferred solution and that fragmentation is likely to continue for some time before we see any consolidation in payment types.""The findings of the report are based on feedback from 790 employees of mid-size and large organizations in seven North American and European countries.ABOUT BNY MELLON BNY Mellon is a global investments company dedicated to helping its clients manage and service their financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle.

If you want to read about some more financial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now.Unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the past few years have helped finance stocks demonstrate their ability to be resilient during times of crisis, boosting investor confidence and resulting in a flurry of new activity in the sector. However, per research firm Deloitte, the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of regional or global recession in 2023 still loom as near-term challenges for the industry, as more regulation and requirements around transparency also become marketplace realities. Some of the best finance stocks to monitor in this macro environment include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). As rising interest rates increase the earnings of banks overnight, recession fears continue to make investors think twice about investments in the sector. In this context, banks are leaning on the lessons learned from the uncertainty of the past few years to focus on smart strategy and execution that relies on talent, technology, risk, and purpose to drive growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the financial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Best Financial Stocks To Buy NowInvestments, FinanceBest Financial Stocks To Buy Now14. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29   Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The company recently said it resolved technical issues that had prevented US bank account users from making payments or withdrawals for most of the day. The firm has been on a downward spiral in the last few weeks on the back of worsening crypto futures even as analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto technology. Story continuesOn September 14, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained a Neutral rating on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock and raised the price target to $78 from $64, highlighting that Coinbase has a substantial revenue opportunity that originates from higher interest rates.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $2.3 billion. Just like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US. It is one of the top financial stocks to invest in. Reports indicate that a recent phishing campaign has targeted the bank's new partnership with verification service Authentify. In the campaign, thousands of scam emails were sent to the bank's customers to try and trick them into uploading images of their identification cards. On September 26. Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker maintained a Neutral rating on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $125, noting that the rapid rise in Fed funds combined with outsized loan growth has led to a significant increase in funding costs for digitally-based depositories. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), with 7.85 million shares worth more than $818 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a financial holding company that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals. It is one of the premier financial stocks to invest in. In August 2022, the company filed with the SEC to launch six ESG ETFs, the first foray into the US ETF space since the pioneering WEBS products were introduced in the 1990s. The proposed ETFs are likely to be listed in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in early 2023.On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stock and lowered the price target to $92 from $105. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with 13.98 million shares worth more than $1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is one of the world’s leading investment banks and wealth management firms. As the company has grown its wealth management business its earnings have become more predictable and valuable. The management team is very shareholder-friendly, allocating funds not needed to grow the business to repurchase shares and raise their dividend. In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It is one of the elite financial stocks to invest in. On August 4, the firm posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $1.90, beating estimates by $0.29. The revenue over the period was $2.63 billion. The firm said it was pleased with its adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $529 million and adjusted pre-tax title margin of 18.9% during the second quarter. On September 23, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane maintained a Hold rating on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) stock and lowered the price target to $90 from $116, noting that the company remains committed to utilizing excess free cash flow for share repurchases next year. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 67 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $3.3 billion in Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), compared to 68 in the preceding quarter worth $3.95 billion. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a financial institution that provides a range of financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It is one of the most prominent financial stocks to invest in. The bank recently announced that it was expanding Transaction Banking to the European Union. Originally launched in the US in 2020 and expanded to the UK in 2021, this growth aims to deepen the relationships with existing clients who have banking needs in the EU. On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stock and lowered the price target to $370 from $430. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.6 billion in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), compared to 71 the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The firm recently announced that it had begun integrating the Square merchant ecosystem with Afterpay in Canada. The integration aims to provide Buy Now, Pay Later functionality to sellers using the e-commerce products of Block.On August 8, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stock and lowered the price target to $125 from $135, noting that the company's Q2 results were fine, but lacked the pop of quarters past.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Wells Fargo.”8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82     Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions.

(NYSE:C) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $55, highlighting that the banks have underperformed this year largely driven by recession fears.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 82 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 88 in the previous quarter worth $8.1 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Captital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83    Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. Mike Santomassimo, the CFO of the firm, recently said that lending growth is moderating from strong levels seen during the second quarter as the US economy slows. During the second quarter, the loans for the firm grew to $926.6 billion from $898.0 billion in Q1, and deposits of $1.45 trillion during the time slid from $1.46 trillion in Q1.On October 5, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden upgraded Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $48, up from $46, noting that the company given its ""best-in-class"" revenue upside and efficiency improvement from interest rates. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.2 billion in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), compared to 93 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital.

S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84  S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. The firm recently announced that it had partnered with Tradeweb Markets, a global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets to introduce electronic connectivity between primary and secondary markets.On August 29, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau maintained an Outperform rating on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) stock and raised the price target to $419 from $404, noting that the large stabilization in capital markets injects confidence that the shares can regain their footing. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, investment firm TCI Fund Management is a leading shareholder in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), with 8.8 million shares worth more than $2.96 billion.Along with Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

A color-coded dashboard is offered to card issuers, thanks to Crypto Secure that helps card issuers exactly identify the crypto exchanges from which the cardholders are purchasing cryptocurrency.Subsequently, the issuers can have a clear understanding of the risk profiles of crypto exchanges or other providers and assess transaction approvals and declines. Thereafter, they can approve transactions with creditable crypto merchants and simultaneously, decline the same with merchants susceptible to fraud.The recent initiative reinforces Mastercard’s efforts to bolster its presence in the growing crypto ecosystem. The technology company in the global payments industry makes continuous efforts to roll out services and capabilities aimed to make crypto easily accessible and more secure for consumers. In this manner, MA keeps an eye on integrating the usage of crypto accounts while incurring daily expenses.In the meantime, Mastercard joins forces with cryptocurrency platforms, which in turn, continue to expand its crypto portfolio and tap the growing number of consumers entering the crypto space.

148,5dac3f7c-acff-3e7c-8c8a-e433c8d1cf62,MA,2022-10-07,Positive week for Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) institutional investors who lost 12% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-mastercard-incorporated-nyse-140029588.html,1665064829,STORY,['MA'],"[Every investor in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 12% losses, last week’s 4.8% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mastercard. See our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Mastercard already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mastercard's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Mastercard Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$300m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Mastercard , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Competition from alternate sources of energy and compilation costs in a stringent regulatory environment are headwinds.TailwindsIDACORP’s regulated electric operations in Idaho generate a relatively stable and growing income stream.

That is because the Oct 21, 2022 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Goodyear shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Goodyear is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Rubber - Tires industry that ranks in the Bottom 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 68 cents per share to 63 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Goodyear right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Biden announced approval of the first $900 million that will be spent in the U.S. to build EV charging stations throughout 35 states. The effort is all part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that was approved late last year.Then you have the lingering shortage of semiconductors, which are critical for building both EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles. Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) projects that the shortage will continue through the middle of next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThrow in record inflation in the U.S., rising interest rates and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and you’ve got an incredibly dynamic set of factors that will weigh on auto stocks in the fourth quarter.How do you cut through the mess?

Its footprint includes manufacturing facilities in 23 countries, and it makes tires under the Sava, Dunlop, Goodyear, Cooper Tires, Fulda, Kelly Tires and Debica brands.Granted, GT stock is down by 50% so far this year. But the company is also consistently beating analysts’ expectations when it’s time to issue an earnings report.Story continuesThe most recent report – Q2 2022 – was no different. Revenue of $5.21 billion was better than the $4.98 billion that analysts expected. Earnings per share of 46 cents was 9 cents per share better than the Street expected.Goodyear could be a company vulnerable to a recession – the American Automobile Association reports drivers are more inclined to put off tire replacements in an economic downturn. But the company’s products will remain in demand – and the buyers will return as the economy improves.GT stock is on sale these days and has a “C” rating in my Portfolio Grader.Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comLegacy American automaker Ford (NYSE:F) is rapidly making the transition to EVs. It boasts a growing lineup of EV models, and it’s committed to selling 600,000 EVs annually by the end of next year.Ford even has an EV version of its famed F-150 pickup, the F-150 Lightning. The company just announced a price hike as it’s reopening orders for the F-150 Lightning, bumping the price between $6,000 and $8,500 higher and raising the minimum price to $47,000.Earnings for the second quarter were sterling. Revenue of $37.91 billion was a 56% increase from a year ago, and beat analysts’ expectations of $35.18 billion. EPS of 68 cents per share was better than the 45 cents that analysts predicted.F stock is down by 45% this year, but it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Tesla (TSLA)A black Tesla (TSLA) Model S is parked between rows of charging stations.Source: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.comYou can’t call Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a legacy automaker. CEO Elon Musk is far too much of a maverick to be a legacy anything – but that seems to have worked out for Tesla. The EV company is the arguable leader in the space, with a market cap of more than $700 billion that leaves all the other companies in the dust.TSLA stock down 30% so far on the year, but as I wrote recently, the company will surely rebound in the near future. As EVs become more commonplace and the U.S. rolls out its network of charging stations, Tesla will be even more popular.Need more convincing? Don’t forget to look at the numbers. Q2 revenue of $16.93 billion matched expectations, and EPS of 76 cents was much better than the 60 cents per share that analysts expected.TSLA stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Tata Motors Limited (TTM)A Tata Motors sign in New Delhi, India. TTM stockSource: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.comIt’s time to diversify your selection of auto stocks. U.S.-based stocks have plenty of headwinds, as discussed. But if you want to look at investing in a group of auto stocks, then India-based Tata Motors (NYSE:TTM) is a tempting target.Tata Motors got its start nearly 80 years ago as a manufacturer of locomotives. But by the 1990s it was a serious player in passenger vehicles.Since then, Tata Motors has grown into a company with a market cap of more than $17 billion. Subsidiaries include Jaguar Land Rover, which makes Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, as well as South Korea’s Tata Daewoo. Tata Motors also has 75% of the EV market in India. Its Nexon EV gets roughly 3,500 orders per month.While earnings have been a disappointment (TTM missed on both top- and bottom-line fiscal Q1 2023 numbers) there’s significant potential here, particularly as some of the headwinds facing EV stocks begins to clear.TTM stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.LKQ Corporation (LKQ)The LKQ Corporation (LKQ) logo is displayed on a smartphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBased in Chicago, LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) is a specialty parts provider for vehicles, specializing in salvage and recycled auto parts. That’s particularly important as people are holding onto the vehicles longer than ever these days.LKQ bills itself as the largest provider of what it calls “alternative vehicle collision replacement products.”While that paints a picture of gasoline-powered combustion engines, LKQ is gearing up for the EV evolution. According to the company, EVs have fewer components than cars powered by a combustion engine, and therefore have lower servicing costs. So, if people are going to invest big bucks in an electric vehicle, they theoretically have a greater opportunity to keep it for longer periods of times because the repairs should be easier.Last year, LKQ bought a North Carolina company, Green Bean Battery, that repurposes EV batteries.LKQ stock is down 19% so far this year, but its earnings over the last 12 months have nearly always beat on both top and bottom lines. The only exception was in the second quarter, in which LKQ missed revenue estimates of $3.39 billion by posting $3.34 billion. But even then, it topped EPS projections by 7 cents per share by posting $1.09.LKQ stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.XPEL (XPEL)Cars on an urban highway driving into the sunsetSource: Anna Kraynova / ShutterstockIf you want to hold on to your car for a long time and want to keep it looking in too shape, then XPEL (NASDAQ:XPEL) may be the answer you’re looking for among auto stocks. The Texas-based company is known for its protective films and coatings, including automotive paints. It also provides products for vehicle wraps, window tinting and ceramic coating. For the interior, its products include antimicrobial film for touch screens, displays and other surfaces.In July, it was reported that BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) the investment managing firm, purchased a 10% stake in XPEL.For the second quarter, XPEL announced revenue of $83.89 million, which beat analysts’ expectations for $78.55 million. Earnings of 43 cents per share also topped expectations of 34 cents per share.Despite an up-and-down 2022, XPEL stock is down by only 5% on the year. And it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Lucid Group (LCID)The Lucid Motors (LCID) Plant in Arizona.Source: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comIt hasn’t all been roses for Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock. Down a whopping 60% so far this year, Lucid has failed – so far – to mount a serious challenge to Tesla.But, as I wrote recently, there’s plenty of reason to like Lucid stock, particularly given the superior design and positive reviews the EVs are getting.On top of that, Lucid’s batteries seem to be superior to Tesla’s, with R.F. Lafferty analyst Jamie Perez calling it a “key differentiator” between the two companies. Perez set a $19 price target and issued a “buy” rating.But revenues remain minimal for now as the company has slashed production projections as it tries to get off the floor. Revenue for the second quarter was only $97.34 million, or 38% less than the $157.12 million that the Street expected. The company also posted a loss of 33 cents per share, which was worse than the 31-cent loss that analysts projected.Currently LCID stock has a “C” rating in the Portfolio Grader, but it needs more production before it mounts a serious challenge to Tesla.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held a position in F stock.

A color-coded dashboard is offered to card issuers, thanks to Crypto Secure that helps card issuers exactly identify the crypto exchanges from which the cardholders are purchasing cryptocurrency.Subsequently, the issuers can have a clear understanding of the risk profiles of crypto exchanges or other providers and assess transaction approvals and declines. Thereafter, they can approve transactions with creditable crypto merchants and simultaneously, decline the same with merchants susceptible to fraud.The recent initiative reinforces Mastercard’s efforts to bolster its presence in the growing crypto ecosystem. The technology company in the global payments industry makes continuous efforts to roll out services and capabilities aimed to make crypto easily accessible and more secure for consumers. In this manner, MA keeps an eye on integrating the usage of crypto accounts while incurring daily expenses.In the meantime, Mastercard joins forces with cryptocurrency platforms, which in turn, continue to expand its crypto portfolio and tap the growing number of consumers entering the crypto space. Not a very long time ago, in June 2022, MA collaborated with the cryptocurrency exchange Young Platform and the global payments solution provider Checkout.com to introduce Mastercard Send across Italy for instant payments and easy fund transfer through digital currency wallets.As a measure to counter risks that tag along with crypto transactions, MA has cybersecurity protection solutions in place for the seamless operation of the crypto environment. Inclusion of cutting-edge technologies following the acquisitions of Finicity, Ekata and RiskRecon further aided MA to pursue its endeavor of bridging the gap between consumers and cryptocurrencies.Story continuesThe latest Crypto Secure launch seems to be a well-timed move by Mastercard, considering the fact that the digital asset sector, of which cryptocurrency is part of, holds immense growth potential amid a rapidly growing digital economy, emergence of advanced technologies and the rising Internet penetration. The global cryptocurrency market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of more than 12% over the 2022-2028 period, according to a report of Blueweave Consulting.Shares of Mastercard have lost 14% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The first study, PANORAMIC, was conducted by the University of Oxford in the UK in highly-vaccinated adults mostly less than age 65 during the period when the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant was predominantly Omicron. The second study, Clalit, was conducted by investigators in Israel in mostly older adults with underlying chronic health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease, also when Omicron was the most dominant strain. The PANORAMIC pre-print was published today and the Clalit pre-print was published last week. Additionally, Merck is reporting results from a recent carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice, which demonstrated that LAGEVRIO was not carcinogenic at any dose tested.Story continuesPreliminary results from the PANORAMIC studyThe PANORAMIC study, a UK-based clinical trial sponsored by the University of Oxford, included 25,783 participants who were randomized to open label treatment with LAGEVRIO plus usual care (n=12,821) or usual care alone (n=12,962); mean age of participants was56.6 years. Primary outcome data were available in 25,000 (97%) participants. Nearly all (&gt;98%) participants were vaccinated, with approximately 95% receiving three or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In the preliminary analysis, the primary endpoint of reduction of hospitalizations and deaths within 28 days of randomization, compared to usual care, was not met; 0.8% of patients in both the LAGEVRIO group (n=103/12,516) and the usual care group (n=96/12,484) were hospitalized or died in the first 28 days.On secondary objectives, LAGEVRIO was associated with improvement on a range of measures compared to usual care. The observed median time to first self-reported recovery (the main secondary endpoint) was 6 days shorter in the LAGEVRIO group; the median time to first recovery was 9 days on LAGEVRIO (range 5-23 days) vs. 15 days on usual care (range 7 to not reached). Following adjustment for age and baseline comorbidity, there was a substantial estimated improvement of 4 days in time-to-first recovery in the LAGEVRIO group vs. usual care group (10.4 days vs. 14.5 days; treatment benefit ratio 1.36 (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) 1.3-1.4). The finding on time-to-first recovery was consistent for LAGEVRIO across key subgroups. Secondary objectives were not adjusted for multiplicity.Results from the Clalit studyIn this observational, retrospective cohort study, LAGEVRIO was associated with a lower rate of hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above, but not in younger adults. In patients 65 years of age and above (n=13,569), hospitalizations related to COVID-19, the primary endpoint, occurred in 18 LAGEVRIO-treated patients (74.6 per 100,000 person-days) and in 513 untreated patients (127.6 per 100,000 person-days); adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for hospitalization was 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.88). The secondary endpoint of death due to COVID-19 in this same age group occurred in 4 of 845 LAGEVRIO-treated and 137 of 12,724 untreated patients; adjusted HR=0.26 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.73).In patients 40 to 64 years of age (n=6,229), hospitalizations related to COVID-19, the primary endpoint, occurred in 8 treated patients (125.8 per 100,000 person-days) and97 untreated patients (49.1 per 100,000 person-days), and adjusted HR for hospitalization was 1.80 (95% CI, 0.86 to 3.77). The secondary endpoint of death due to COVID-19 in this same age group occurred in 4 of 224 LAGEVRIO-treated and 7 of 6,075 untreated patients; adjusted HR=12.82 (95% CI, 3.41 to 48.17). All four deaths in the LAGEVRIO-treated group occurred in patients 60-64 years of age.""The totality of the data from both PANORAMIC and Clalit give us critical insights into the ways certain patients may benefit from treatment with LAGEVRIO. These data also emphasize the critical need and value for LAGEVRIO in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 for appropriate high-risk patients. Most significantly, the Clalit study reinforces what the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT study demonstrated - a reduction in hospitalizations and mortality in an older population at high risk for progression to severe disease, where a clinically meaningful benefit was observed,"" said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These findings, particularly with regard to symptomatic improvement seen in a secondary objective in PANORAMIC and the reduction in hospitalization and death rates seen in the older part of the patient population in Clalit, further support the urgent need for global access to LAGEVRIO for the treatment of COVID-19 in appropriate high-risk patients.""""With the continuing uncertainty about potential severity of emerging variants, we are pleased that the real-world data from Israel showed that, in an older part of the study population that experienced more hospitalizations, rates of hospitalization and death were reduced in patients taking LAGEVRIO. Also notable is the substantial reduction in time to symptom resolution observed on a secondary endpoint in PANORAMIC even when background hospitalization rates were low. The observed six-day improvement symptom resolution in the PANORAMIC study is an important finding as we look for ways to further reduce the burden of this virus. As studies begin to assess how this medicine could potentially treat other significant illnesses with pandemic potential, we will remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring global access to this important treatment,"" said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.Additional results - PANORAMIC secondary and virology endpointsOn additional secondary objectives in the PANORAMIC study, compared to usual care, LAGEVRIO-treated participants reported:Reduced time to sustained recovery (21 days vs. 24 days);Reduced time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms (9 days vs. 12 days);Reduced time to reduction of symptom severity (8 days vs. 12 days);Higher self-rating of wellness on Days 7, 14, and 28;Fewer moderate or severe symptoms at Day 7, 14, and 28 for cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, and fatigue;Less health care seeking in primary care, including less contacts with a general practitioner or the UK National Health Service (NHS).Additionally, a greater proportion of LAGEVRIO patients reported:Early sustained recovery, defined as recovered by Day 14 and remained recovered until Day 28 (32% receiving LAGEVRIO vs. 23% receiving usual care);Sustained recovery, defined as date participant first reported recovery and subsequently remained well until 28 days (69% vs. 60%);Sustained alleviation of all symptoms, defined as date symptoms first reported as minor or none and subsequently remained minor or none until 28 days (84% vs. 79%).In a substudy in which a cohort of participants was sampled for virology outcomes:On Day 7, SARS-CoV-2 virus was below detection in 21% receiving LAGEVRIO vs. 3% receiving usual care;The mean viral load on Day 7 was lower on LAGEVRIO (3.82 log10 viral load) as compared to usual care (4.93 log10 viral load).LAGEVRIO was generally well tolerated, with serious adverse events reported at a rate of 0.4% in both study groups and a low treatment withdrawal rate (1.1%).About the PANORAMIC studyThe PANORAMIC trial (Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of covid-19 In the Community), led by the University of Oxford and funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), studied treatments approved by the UK Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), including LAGEVRIO, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and ongoing symptoms. The study is a pragmatic-design trial intended to inform policy and public on treatments for COVID-19. The study began recruitment in December 2021 and completed enrollment in April 2022, all during the era of the Omicron variant.The study was designed as an open-label, prospective, individually-randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety for LAGEVRIO added to usual care compared to usual care alone in participants who have confirmed COVID-19 infection, in adults who were either ≥ 50 years of age or ≥ 18 years of age with comorbidities/known underlying chronic health conditions making them clinically vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Usual care was predominantly focused on managing symptoms with antipyretics; however, participants at highest risk (very impaired immunity or extremely clinically vulnerable) were eligible for additional therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (sotrovimab) and intravenous remdesivir.Overall, 25,783 participants were randomized in the trial to LAGEVRIO (added to usual care) or usual care alone; the participant demographics, baseline characteristics, and other COVID-related characteristics at baseline were similar in the 2 groups. The trial sample size was intentionally expanded during the course of the trial from the initial goal of 10,600, due to a very low observed event rate for the primary endpoint of hospitalizations/deaths through Day 28 (observed &lt;1% vs. initial estimate of 3%). Approximately 20% of participants were aged 50 to 65 years without additional risk factors.Treatment with LAGEVRIO (standard dose 800 mg twice daily for 5 days; added to usual care) or usual care alone was initiated within 5 days of COVID-19 symptom onset in participants confirmed to have a positive PCR or rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 in the past 7 days prior to treatment onset. The median duration of COVID-19 symptoms prior to treatment onset was 3 days. Overall, 87% of participants received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset. More than 95% of the participants reported taking LAGEVRIO for the full 5-day treatment course.About the Clalit Health Services trialThe Clalit trial, an observational, retrospective cohort study, evaluated data obtained from the electronic medical records of members of Clalit Health Services (CHS), a large healthcare organization covering approximately 65% of the elderly Israeli population. The study assessed the real-world effectiveness of LAGEVRIO in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients 40 years of age and older estimated to be at high risk of progression to severe disease, who were infected by the Omicron variant and were not eligible for ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir therapy due to drug-drug interactions or impaired kidney function. High risk was defined according to a predictive risk score developed in CHS to evaluate the risk for severe COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients; patients with a score of 2 points or more were considered high risk. The most common coexisting conditions were obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. The study period started on January 16, 2022, the first day LAGEVRIO was administered to CHS patients, and ended on March 31, 2022, while the Omicron variant (BA.1) was the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in Israel.A total of 1,166,404 CHS members were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Of them, 19,868 patients were eligible for LAGEVRIO therapy; 1,069 (5%) patients received at least one dose of LAGEVRIO. The mean age of the study participants was 69 years, with 68% of the participants aged 65 years and older. Eighty-two percent of participants had previous COVID-19 immunity, either by vaccination, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or hybrid immunity. Patients residing in long-term care facilities, patients hospitalized before or on the same day of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and patients treated with ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir or monoclonal antibodies were all excluded from the study.Recent hospitalizations, active cancer, and diabetes were associated with high rates of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 across both age groups. Chronic heart failure, active cancer disease, prior CVA and COPD were prominent risk factors in patients aged 65 years or older. In the younger age group, immunosuppression and lack of prior immunity were strongly associated with the risk of hospitalizations related to COVID-19.Update on results from recent carcinogenicity studyResults from a recent study (Tg RasH2) evaluating carcinogenicity in transgenic mice that received molnupiravir orally for six months at doses of 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day demonstrated that LAGEVRIO was not carcinogenic. These results further support the safety profile of LAGEVRIO.About Merck’s Global Efforts to Accelerate Access to LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) Following Regulatory Authorizations or ApprovalsGlobal access has been a priority for Merck and Ridgeback since the inception of their LAGEVRIO collaboration. The companies are committed to providing timely access to LAGEVRIO globally through our comprehensive supply and access approach, which includes:Supply: Patients around the world have received more than 2 million courses of LAGEVRIO. Merck has supplied LAGEVRIO to more than 30 markets worldwide.Voluntary licenses: As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck granted voluntary licenses (VLs) to generic manufacturers and to the Medicines Patent Pool to make generic molnupiravir available in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Through our VL agreements with generic manufacturers, more than 3 million courses of molnupiravir have been delivered to nearly 20 markets through September 2022. Additionally, Hetero Labs, Ltd. has received WHO prequalification, an important step in enabling broader access for molnupiravir.UNICEF: To supplement the supply from licensed generic manufacturers and bridge to the availability of WHO prequalified generic supply, Merck entered into an agreement with UNICEF to allocate up to 3 million courses of LAGEVRIO to facilitate timely supply to low- and middle-income countries from January 2022. Merck has also committed 2 million patient courses of LAGEVRIO, available to USAID at Merck’s best access price to increase access in lower-income countries.Product donation: Merck has donated 100,000 courses of therapy to Direct Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees in low- and middle-income countries, including 50,000 courses of therapy for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.Purchase and supply agreements: Merck entered into a procurement agreement with the U.S. government under which the company supplied approximately 3.1 million courses of LAGEVRIO to the U.S. government, upon Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a Test-to-Treat locator to help identify pharmacies and community health centers across the nation where people can get tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate treatments, as needed.Merck has also entered into additional advance purchase and supply agreements for LAGEVRIO with governments of more than 40 markets worldwide and is currently in discussions with additional governments. Merck is implementing a tiered-pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic.Merck continues to discuss additional measures and collaborations to accelerate broad, global access to LAGEVRIO.Authorized Use of LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) in the U.S.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA for the emergency use of the unapproved product LAGEVRIO, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by viral mutagenesis, for the treatment of mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use, including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.The emergency use of LAGEVRIO is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIOContraindicationsNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA.Warnings and PrecautionsThere are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.LAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.LAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.There is a pregnancy surveillance program that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of Merck’s pregnancy surveillance program at 1-877-888-4231 or pregnancyreporting.msd.com. If the pregnant individual agrees to participate in the pregnancy surveillance program and allows the prescribing healthcare provider to disclose patient specific information to Merck, the prescribing healthcare provider must provide the patient’s name and contact information to Merck. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO can also report the exposure by contacting Merck at 1-877-888-4231 or pregnancyreporting.msd.comAdvise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose.Prior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).Serious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.Drug InteractionsNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.Pregnancy/BreastfeedingThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.Males of Reproductive PotentialNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO is unknown.Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication ErrorsThe prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to LAGEVRIO within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Complete and submit the report online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 (https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download) and return by:Mail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, orFax to 1-800-FDA-0178 orCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to:Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA by:Fax: 215-616-5677E-mail: dpoc.usa@merck.comAbout LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir)LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.Merck and Ridgeback’s ""orange COVID-19 pill"" is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and ""82"" printed in white ink, available in certain markets as LAGEVRIO.Molnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. LAGEVRIO is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of LAGEVRIO have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.LAGEVRIO was evaluated in MOVe-OUT, a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally in more than 170 sites in locations including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov.

Per GSK, the PERLA study was not designed to demonstrate the superiority of Jemperli over Keytruda in NSCLC indication.GSK did not share any clinical data on how Jemperli fared against Merck’s Keytruda. The company expects to present the full results from the study later at a medical meeting.Jemperli was approved by the FDA last year under the accelerated pathway to treat adult patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer and solid tumors. The drug is yet to be approved by any regulatory authority across the globe for NSCLC indication.Shares of GSK have plunged 44.8% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 25.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchApart from the above news, GSK also announced that it is advancing the phase II/III COSTAR Lung study into late-stage development. The study is evaluating the combination of Jemperli and chemotherapy drug docetaxel, with or without GSK’s investigational TIM-3 inhibitor cobolimab against docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC who have been treated with an anti-PD-L1 therapy and chemotherapy.Jemperli and cobolimab were developed by GSK in collaboration with AnaptysBio ANAB. GSK and AnaptysBio entered into an agreement in 2014 to develop therapies targeting immuno-oncology indications. Jemperli and cobolimab were originally discovered by AnaptysBio and licensed to GSK, which is responsible for the development, commercialization and manufacturing of these inhibitors. Once the first patient is dosed in the phase III portion of the COSTAR Lung study, AnaptysBio is eligible to receive $5 million as a milestone payment from GSK. This payment is expected to be triggered in fourth-quarter 2022.Story continuesGSK’s Jemperli is one of the most recently approved PD-1 inhibitors available in the market. The drug faces stiff competition from Keytruda, a blockbuster PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor drug developed by Merck. A key revenue generator for Merck, Keytruda is approved for the treatment of many cancer indications globally. During second-quarter 2022, Merck recorded $5.3 billion worth of sales from Keytruda. Sales of Keytruda continue to grow driven by continued uptake in lung cancer and increasing usage in other cancer indications.GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Price GSK PLC Sponsored ADR PriceGSK PLC Sponsored ADR price | GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderGSK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 drug companies in the world in 2022.While major pharmaceutical companies have always been derided for considering profits over the well-being of the general population, even earning the moniker of ""Big Pharma"" denoting a shadow organization of the major players in the pharma industry. This is especially relevant in the United States, where prices of drugs are not regulated by the government, allowing the companies to exploit the general population, with perhaps the most infamous such occurring in 2015, when Turing Pharmaceutical's CEO, Martin Shkreli, increase the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000%, from $13.5 a pill to $750. However, the past two years have gone a long way in improving the image of the drug and pharma industry.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the infection and death rate kept increasing exponentially week after week, most countries were at a loss on what to do since this was unlike anything they had prepared for. Immediately, pharma companies started to begin research on developing a vaccine against the coronavirus, but there was little expectation that any meaningful achievement would be managed quickly, especially considering that vaccines can take up to a decade for proper development and sometimes not even then, as evidenced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS as its more popularly known. While the virus first emerged in 2003, there has still been no vaccine developed for it.5 Best Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2022Photo by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashDespite the enormity of the task, to battle the worst pandemic in a decade, some of the biggest drug companies in the world began researching potential vaccines and a year after the virus first emerged, the first vaccine obtained emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 1.5 years down the rate, and the worst of the pandemic seems behind us as billions across the world have been inoculated against the deadly virus.Story continuesWhile many believe that pharma companies had a bumper year after the pandemic as more and more people got sick, the truth is quite different. Many pharma companies saw revenues declining significantly in the wake of the pandemic as global supply chains were completely disrupted. Remember, most multinational companies have production sites which serve multiple markets and with supply chains and logistics disrupted, it was harder to accurately predict supply. This, combined with unpredictable customer behaviors meant that many companies ended up falling below their expected targets.Most of the biggest drug companies in the world operate in the United States, even if their country of incorporation is elsewhere. In fact, the drug industry is set to be worth more than $1.7 trillion by 2025, with just United States and China accounting for more than half the market share. By the way, you can click to following link to see the list of 25 biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world in 2021.To determine 2022's biggest players in the drug industry, we consulted Fortune Global 500 and annual reports of major companies to arrive at our list. Even Fortune 500 isn't completely accurate at times, for example, listing China Resources Group in the pharmaceutical industry, even though its actually a holding company with subsidiaries in various industries. If we hadn't bifurcated CR Pharmaceuticals, which is the pharmaceutical subsidiary of China Resources Group, our list would have been inaccurate and the top spot would have been incorrectly awarded.

164,2c90fe99-a41c-3548-b893-47f43c425d83,MRK,2022-10-07,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-merck-co-130001259.html,1665061201,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of -0.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.33 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.8%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.17 indicates a change of -2.2% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.04 billion and $58.11 billion estimates indicate +17.7% and -1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.36%. The EPS surprise was +11.98%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

165,c7a74337-bcea-3cfa-8713-133d609418a8,MOS,2022-10-07,Mosaic (MOS) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-mos-gains-market-dips-215009199.html,1665093009,STORY,['MOS'],"[Mosaic (MOS) closed the most recent trading day at $51.31, moving +0.43% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.03%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.37%.Heading into today, shares of the fertilizer maker had lost 3.82% over the past month, lagging the Basic Materials sector's gain of 1.01% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.51% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Mosaic as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Mosaic to post earnings of $3.68 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 172.59%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.21 billion, up 81.54% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.46 per share and revenue of $21.13 billion. These totals would mark changes of +167.06% and +71.02%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Mosaic. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.22% lower within the past month. Mosaic is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Mosaic is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 3.8. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 5.1.Story continuesInvestors should also note that MOS has a PEG ratio of 0.54 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Fertilizers was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.59 at yesterday's closing price.The Fertilizers industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 156, which puts it in the bottom 39% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.You can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

166,e222d12a-988a-3fa3-9294-2118a887b162,MOS,2022-10-07,7 Cheap Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Surge Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cheap-large-cap-stocks-100032316.html,1664877632,STORY,"['SU', 'PBR-A', 'CNQ', 'MOS', 'TS', 'MRO']","[As we enter the last quarter of 2022, the macro issues that have defined the year continue to persist. Inflation remains high, interest rates keep climbing, as does the risk of a recession. Yet while overall market sentiment remains deeply negative, there is opportunity to seize, with cheap large-cap stocks to buy.Not only has it been speculative and growth-focused stocks that have hit lower prices following the latest rounds of market volatility. Even more defensive names, as well as stocks benefiting from current trends (commodities stocks) have been been bid down to lower prices.This has created the ability to scoop up many high-quality large-cap stocks at very favorable valuations. Made cheaper by external factors, once these issues clear up, these undervalued but fundamentally superior stocks are well-positioned to make a rapid recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the story here, with these seven large-cap stocks to buy. Earning either an A or B in Portfolio Grader, consider now a great time to enter/add to a position.AMXAmerica Movil SAB de CV$16.86CNQCanadian Natural Resources$49.63MOSMosaic Company$49.20MROMarathon Oil$24.61PBRPetroleo Brasileiro S.A.$13.76SUSuncor Energy$30.34TSTenaris S.A.$27.82America Movil SAB de CV (AMX)A digital illustration of the telecom industry.Source: ShutterstockMexico-based America Movil SAB de CV (NYSE:AMX) is the dominant telecom firm in its home market. It has a 70% and 62% share of the Mexican mobile internet and mobile phone markets, respectively. America Movil also has a substantial presence in Europe, Latin America and the U.S.Holding steady compared to the overall market earlier this year, AMX stock has pulled back in recent months. The aforementioned macro concerns have led investors to shun America Movil shares. However, instead of going with the crowd, you may want to instead take the contrarian view on this stock, which earns a B in Portfolio Grader.Story continuesAs Citi analyst Andres Cardona argued when he upgraded the stock in August, the company’s strong free cash flow points to increased dividends and buybacks. These could help move the AMX stock back higher. A spinoff of its mobile towers business is another potential catalyst.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWith energy prices currently moving lower, the sell-off among oil and gas stocks such as Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) may seem justified. Yet while crude oil prices have fallen back to levels last seen just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (which caused a fossil fuel supply shock), that doesn’t mean the opportunity here with CNQ has come and gone.First, it’s not a given that fossil fuel prices will continue to pull back. In fact, some commodities analysts, including the chief economist of oil trading giant Trafigura, believe that another spike lies ahead next year, due to new supply shocks created by industry underinvestment.Second, as demand could continue to outstrip supply, this energy company is likely to continue using the high profits resulting from high oil and gas prices to pay down debt, buy back stock and issue special dividends.CNQ stock earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Mosaic Company (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith investors declaring the Russia/Ukraine-driven spike in fertilizer prices as temporary, Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) shares have fallen considerably in the past few months.The market currently is pricing this provider of fertilizer ingredients like phosphates and potash as if its recent windfall earnings are going to reverse.But taking a look at the details, so far fertilizer prices have stayed high. While something that would have worsened the supply crisis (destruction of a key fertilizer facility by Hurricane Ian) fortunately did not happen, the key factor keeping supplies tight (sanctions against Russia) continues. This points to prices remaining high, which of course is good news for Mosaic.MOS stock (which earns a B in Portfolio Grader) currently trades for 3.6 times earnings. If the company continues to report similar results, the stock could get out of its current slump, and resume an upwards trajectory.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another situation where the market is overestimating how much the latest energy price trends will affect future results and underappreciating the company’s ability to deliver strong returns to its shareholders.MRO stock trades for only 4.8 times 2022 estimated earnings. Even if Marathon’s earnings per share (or EPS) falls from $4.93 to $4.33 next year (per sell-side forecasts), Marathon still trades at a low valuation (5.4 times earnings).Beyond just the potential for shares to rise on multiple expansion, what could really move the needle for Marathon Oil stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) is management’s decision to return a majority of its cash flow back to investors.Since last October, Marathon has bought back over $2.3 billion worth of shares. While its current dividend (1.36% forward yield) is modest, there’s substantial room for dividend growth.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR)the Petroleo Brasileiro logo on a building during daylightSource: A.PAES / Shutterstock.comBetter known as Petrobras, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE:PBR) is Brazil’s biggest oil company. Recently, this large-cap energy stock has been under pressure and not just because of the pullback in crude oil prices.Brazil’s 2022 Presidential election has also weighed on PBR stock. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who won a plurality of votes in the first round on Oct. 2, has a strong chance of winning the Oct. 30 run-off election. The left-wing candidate’s plans for Petrobras could come at the expense of PBR’s minority shareholders.However, as one sell-side analyst (J.P. Morgan’s Rodolfo Angele) has argued, it’s possible that the prospect of a da Silva victory is already priced-in. I agree with this view, given PBR stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) trades for only 3 times 2022 earnings. If uncertainties about Petrobras’ future resolve, shares could experience an outsized rebound.Suncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy (NYSE:SU) is another of the cheap large-cap stocks to buy in the energy sector. As with the two other energy stocks listed above, Suncor has been pushed to an extremely-discounted valuation.SU stock currently trades for just four times 2022 estimated earnings. Besides the potential for a re-rating, if oil prices remain high, there’s another catalyst in motion. Back in July, Suncor added three directors to its board backed by activist fund Elliott Investment Management.Furthermore, Suncor said it was open to Elliott’s idea of selling its retail gas station chain, Petro-Canada. A sale of Petro-Canada, along with other ideas Elliott has suggested (like enhanced capital return) could enable this stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) to move towards prices more reflective of Suncor’s underlying value. Along with two catalysts to move it higher, SU stock also sports a 5% forward dividend yield.Tenaris S.A. (TS)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockTenaris S.A. (NYSE:TS) is a producer of steel products for the oil and gas industry with operations throughout the world. Tenaris rallied earlier this year, alongside other energy-related stocks on the heels of Russia’s Ukraine invasion.Since then, TS stock has given back these gains, as Russia-related tailwinds have become outweighed by concerns about a global recession. However, the current bearish sentiment for shares works to your advantage.Trading at a low valuation (7.7 times earnings), and sporting a 4.33% forward yield, TS stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) could deliver strong returns for investors buying it today.As Tenaris argued in its Sept. 30. investor presentation,  as demand for fossil fuels will keep rising, even with the shift towards renewable energy, long-term trends remain on the company’s side. This points to continued growth for Tenaris, and a continued move higher for TS stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in CNQ, MRO, PBR, SU and TS.

""Boeing and our teammates stand ready to support the people of Florida, and we are hopeful that this assistance will help with ongoing search and rescue missions as well as bring some relief to those who are suffering.""""On behalf of Volunteer Florida, we would like to thank Boeing for their significant financial contribution to the Florida Disaster Fund in response to the state-wide recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian, said CEO of Volunteer Florida Josie Tamayo.

169,77cd7b94-b6fc-3982-8135-87a564ce9fb4,BA,2022-10-07,The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 50% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-nyse-ba-largely-130038654.html,1665061238,STORY,['BA'],"[If you want to know who really controls The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 50% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Boeing. See our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Boeing. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Boeing's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Boeing. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.5% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of BoeingThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Boeing Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$55m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 43% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Boeing better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Boeing , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The work related to the deal will be performed in Groton, CT, and Newport News, VA.The contract is valued at $532.9 million and is expected to be completed by October 2023. Per the contract, General Dynamics Electric Boat will provide lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class attack submarines.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly for upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. To this end, military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form integral parts of any nation’s defense system.Therefore, the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines. The unit has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy.In this regard, the business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. General Dynamics plans to invest $1.8 billion of capital in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support growth in submarine construction.Peer MovesNations are reinforcing their defense capabilities to deter any warfare-like situation. Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2031. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines and can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 9.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. Northrop Grumman also provides launch systems for submarines. Its eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.9% in the last four quarters.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its division, Newport News, is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2022 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 13.6%. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 12.4% in the last four quarters.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, David Perry, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$394 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$484. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 25% of David Perry's holding.Northrop Grumman insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Northrop Grumman insiders own about US$135m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Northrop Grumman Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Northrop Grumman insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Northrop Grumman insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Northrop Grumman.

Despite Nike's inventory woes and margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and buy rating on the athleisure maker, calling it its best idea into 2023. Or another way of looking at this, they're saying, just do it. [LAUGHS] Just buy the stock. Oh, I couldn't. I can't. I can't.BRAD SMITH: That too.BRIAN SOZZI: It's not Friday. Had to let it out.JULIE HYMAN: Did you know that the man who invented that slogan has just died?BRIAN SOZZI: Really? Way to bring my energy--JULIE HYMAN: Yes.BRIAN SOZZI: --down.JULIE HYMAN: I'm so sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I was so excited.JULIE HYMAN: But yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: But now I'm not.JULIE HYMAN: But it's an amazing achievement, so.BRIAN SOZZI: Great, just ruin my whole--JULIE HYMAN: Sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: --thing right here. My whole buzz.JULIE HYMAN: Sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I'll try to bring us--JULIE HYMAN: Sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: --back. So interesting note bye Guggenheim--JULIE HYMAN: [LAUGHS] Sorry.BRIAN SOZZI: I love-- I'm a big fan of Robert [? Durbel's ?] work, he actually notes at the top of this report that he's been covering the company for about 20 years. It feels like I've been following him for 20 years.But he does note that, while profits are under pressure, he does still like Nike's brand equity. It likes its grand-- its scale around the world, likes its structural advantage in terms of its supply chain. And he goes on to say, again, some pretty cool charts, that-- yes, Brad, you wear Nike's?BRAD SMITH: Not today.BRIAN SOZZI: And I know I'm--JULIE HYMAN: I was just checking [INAUDIBLE].BRAD SMITH: I'm wearing a brand that's--BRIAN SOZZI: I saw the eyes. I saw the eyes move down. They're Nike.BRAD SMITH: Yes.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: But [? Durbel ?] also notes that, ""We would note that Nike has a history of quick operating margin recovery from steep macro driven drops."" And we might be looking-- I think investors might be looking for that to happen very, very soon.BRAD SMITH: I'm wearing a brand today that was formerly owned by Nike. They divested from Cole Haan.JULIE HYMAN: Oh--BRIAN SOZZI: Cole Haan.JULIE HYMAN: --yes.BRIAN SOZZI: I like Cole Haan.BRAD SMITH: Not before making them really revolutionary, at least with the different soles that Cole Haan would use, in the Lunar Line from Nike. But again, I mean, this is really just kind of leaning into that brand equity that Nike has.And we were actually tossing around some of the stats that Julie was pulling earlier, before the show. 22 out of the past 25 years, Nike has beat the S&amp;P 500 performance here. And so you continue to think about what the brand has done over that time, whether it's some of the different acquisitions, making strategic decisions to get out of certain sports or at least equipment-making in some sports, that's really led to the company being able to financially put those dollars, that capital, to work elsewhere. And the cultural partnerships that they've been able to make over time as well that keep them in the spotlight.JULIE HYMAN: I just bought a new pair of sneakers.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, which ones?JULIE HYMAN: I did not buy Nikes.BRAD SMITH: Really?JULIE HYMAN: I bought Sauconys. I tried on a pair of Nikes.BRAD SMITH: They're good, though.JULIE HYMAN: I tried on a pair of Sauconys.BRAD SMITH: Good running shoe.JULIE HYMAN: It's not for running. It's just for [? caj, ?] for comfortable shoe.BRIAN SOZZI: What happened to your retro Reeboks? No go? You didn't pull the trigger?JULIE HYMAN: I didn't. Not yet. Not yet.

(NKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-trending-stock-130001648.html,1665061201,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -16% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.5% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has lost 12.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share, indicating a change of -19.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.15 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16%. This estimate has changed -17.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.97 indicates a change of +26.2% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -13.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $48.97 billion and $53.33 billion estimates indicate +4.9% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NKE) By 26%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-nike-inc-nyse-120043127.html,1665057643,STORY,['NKE'],"[How far off is NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for NIKE What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.71bUS$5.76bUS$6.81bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.05%Est @ 6.92%Est @ 5.43%Est @ 4.38%Est @ 3.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$4.4kUS$5.1kUS$5.6kUS$5.8kUS$6.2kUS$6.4kUS$6.4kUS$6.3kUS$6.2kUS$6.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$58bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.5%– 1.9%) = US$254bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$254b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$135bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$194b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$91.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.072. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 2022. The performance of cyclical stocks is largely tied to economic recovery. Amid global inflation, threats of recession, and rampant rate hikes, these equities might be trading at a significant discount as investors ignore the potential for global economic rebound.In late July, Courtney Garcia, Payne Capital Market senior wealth advisor, told CNBC that investors should monitor the stock market for the next 6 to 12 months, rather than worry about what happens the next day or week. She believes that inflation will eventually ease, be it at the end of 2022 or next year, and she advised investors to maintain positions in cyclical stocks, in addition to inflation hedges like energy and commodities for a balanced portfolio. As of mid-September, analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that the US might be able to achieve a soft landing, as latest data indicates rebounding growth and bolstered consumer confidence. Markets can rally on the back of government capital stimulus in China and energy transition plans in Europe. Investors in the United States believe that inflation may have peaked, and they look forward to a stock market recovery. This is a positive catalyst for cyclical stocks, as risk appetite in the market will also increase.  Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy in 2022 include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Our Methodology We carried out a detailed assessment of cyclical industries, including restaurants, hotels, home improvement, high-end fashion retailers, and automobile manufacturers. We selected the following stocks based on positive analyst coverage, solid demand, and strong hedge fund sentiment. We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2022 database of about 900 elite hedge funds. Story continues10 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 2022Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 202210. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was founded in 2002 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company owns and operates integrated resorts, with casinos, private gaming salons, luxury hotel towers, health clubs, spas, and pools. The stock has climbed over 20% in the last month as of October 4, and this is primarily attributable to positive news related to relaxation of border restrictions in China. On September 26, Jefferies analyst David Katz upgraded Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $75, up from $62, in light of the Macau government announcing the resumption of visitation access from Mainland China through tours and e-visas by the end of October to early November, calling it ""the moment we've been waiting for."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, 26 hedge funds were long Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 32 funds in the last quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is a notable position holder in the company, with 360,232 shares worth $20.5 million. Like Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is one of the best cyclical stocks to buy in 2022. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.” 9. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a Colorado-based company engaged in the design, marketing, and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear, and related products in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) distributed a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend on September 30. The company delivers a dividend yield of 6.29% as of October 4. Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone on September 30 maintained a Buy rating on V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) but lowered the price target on the shares to $43 from $56. While the analyst is encouraged by V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)’s long-term outlook and commitment to deliver resilient shareholder returns, she is cautious around short-term patterns, especially at the Vans brand. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 29 hedge funds held stakes worth $316.30 million in V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), compared to 28 funds in the earlier quarter worth $330.35 million. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.90 million shares valued at approximately $305 million. Here is what Diamond Hill All Cap Select Fund Concentrated Fund has to say about V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Apparel and footwear company V.F. Corporation underperformed due to the longer-than-expected recovery for its Vans brand, elevated freight costs dampening gross margin, and its modest exposure to the slowdown in China. The company’s remaining brands are performing well. Although consolidated results have been choppy, we believe management is making the right strategic decisions for future profitable growth.”8. Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) owns and operates full-service restaurants in the United States and Canada.

Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) delivers a dividend yield of 3.69% as of October 4. It is one of the best cyclical stocks for 2022. Truist analyst Jake Bartlett on September 23 raised the price target on Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) to $142 from $136 and kept a Buy rating on the shares after its FQ1 results. The earnings and the latest ""strong improvement"" in trends show that restaurant demand is resilient despite macro pressures, the analyst told investors.

(NYSE:DRI) observed softer demand from lower income consumers, it was ""not severe"", and the management also assured about solid demand from other income levels.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 32 hedge funds were long Darden Restaurants, Inc.

(NYSE:CMG) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a California-based company that owns and operates Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. The company has more than 3,000 restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe. On September 27, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) announced some new tech initiatives it is employing to improve its employee and customer experience. These include AI and machine learning to monitor ingredient levels in real time, autonomous cooking assistants, and advanced location-based tech to enhance app functionality. On September 22, Stephens analyst Joshua Long initiated coverage of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) with an Overweight rating and a $1,900 price target. The analyst views Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) as a ""best-in-class operator"" within the fast casual dining segment that is positioned advantageously to benefit from consumer demand for its brand experience. The company's growth story is ""anchored by the compelling unit economics and continued growth of its digitally-enabled store base,"" the analyst told investors in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 39 funds were long Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 38 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with 1.10 million shares valued at $1.4 billion. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings specifically said about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

Selling at an average price of US$44.44, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$42.24. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Wells Fargo better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Wells Fargo Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$118m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Wells Fargo insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Wells Fargo.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

192,7cc4eaaf-7a51-308a-b1ed-ca5999de1004,WFC,2022-10-07,Wells Fargo (WFC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-expected-beat-140002488.html,1665064802,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Wells Fargo (WFC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6%.Revenues are expected to be $18.69 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Wells Fargo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of -3.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wells Fargo appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Pfizer with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Pfizer How Fast Is Pfizer Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Pfizer has grown EPS by 33% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Pfizer shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 27% to 38%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Pfizer.Story continuesAre Pfizer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Pfizer has a market capitalisation of US$242b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$88m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Should You Add Pfizer To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Pfizer's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

The Value Investor Podcast first launched in July 2016. It's been over 6 years of episodes and we've finally reached the magical 300th episode. Thanks to everyone for listing through the ups and downs of the last few years.And thanks to the new listeners who have found the Value Investor Podcast in 2022 because value stocks are back in vogue.It's a good time to be a value investor.Buffett's Investing Advice in 2008However, 2022 has been rough for investors, whether in value or growth stocks. That's why it always pays to consult with the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, for advice on what to do during a big stock market sell-off.And what was a bigger sell-off than the stock market in 2008 during the financial crisis?Buffett took pen to paper on Oct 16, 2008 and published an op-ed in the New York Times called: Buy American. I am. You can read it here.He said about 2008, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""Buffett also warned that earnings could take a hit as businesses suffered through tough economic times but that he believed most companies would be setting new profit records 5, 10 or 20 years down the line.Story continuesSound familiar?Stay the CourseBuffett also advised that there will be dark times and that's when investors should be buying. He said that in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was while inflation raged and the economy was in the tank.The stock market has a habit of rebounding well before a recession ends. Wall Street tends to ""price in"" all the bad news months ahead of time.That's why it's so difficult to try and time the bottom. Buffett said in 2008 he wasn't going to try and time it for the short-term, as he had a long-term investing horizon.That's good advice.5 Cheap Stocks That Pay Dividends1.       ExxonMobil XOMYou don't have to reinvent the wheel. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been buying Chevron this year but ExxonMobil is also cheap.Shares of ExxonMobil are up big in 2022 thanks to rising oil and natural gas prices. It's jumped 62% year-to-date.But ExxonMobil has a forward P/E of just 7.4 and a PEG ratio of just 0.3.

It now trades with a forward P/E of just 6.8.Pfizer also pays a juicy dividend, yielding 3.6%.Are you waiting to see if Pfizer will get even cheaper?3.       Union Pacific UNPUnion Pacific has been around since the 1860s.

It trades with a forward P/E of just 11.8.In the 1990s, Cisco didn't pay a dividend, but it does now, and it's yielding a juicy 3.6%.Should Cisco be the tech company on your short list?5.       PNC Financial PNCPNC Financial is a large regional bank headquartered in Pittsburgh.

Victoria previously said it signed a deal for Moderna to build an mRNA manufacturing facility in Monash University.Financial terms of neither deals were disclosed.

MSFT posted quarterly free cash flow of a steep $17.8 billion in its latest quarter, reflecting Y/Y growth of nearly 10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn top of tech exposure, MSFT pays out an annual dividend that yields 1%, nicely above its Zacks Computer and Technology Sector average of 0.9%.Impressively, Microsoft has upped its dividend payout six times over the last five years, carrying a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough a hawkish Federal Reserve has played spoilsport for many tech stocks in 2022, MSFT is still forecasted to grow at a solid pace; earnings are forecasted to climb 9.2% in FY23 and a further double-digit 16% in FY24.The earnings increase comes on top of projected revenue growth of 11% and 13.4% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile selecting stocks is always challenging, a good filter would be focusing on companies with healthy free cash flow.A solid free cash flow speaks volumes about a company’s financial state, telling us if it has sufficient funds to wipe out debt, pay dividends, or buy back stock.For those looking to target stocks with free cash flow strength - Exxon Mobil XOM, Microsoft MSFT, and Pfizer PFE – would all be great places to start.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is up from the 7.6 million people who received the shot as of Sept. 28.The 11.5-million figure represents only 5.3% of the 215.5 million people in the United States aged 12 or older who are eligible to receive the shots because they have completed their primary vaccination series.The shots are being administered at a slower pace than last year, when the United States initially authorized COVID boosters just for older and immunocompromised people. Around 20 million people received their third shot in the first five weeks of that vaccination campaign.A recent survey conducted by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly two-thirds of adults in the United States do not plan to get updated COVID-19 booster shots soon.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer and Moderna's Omicron-tailored shots in August in preparation for the country's ongoing fall revaccination campaign.The CDC tally includes booster shots from both Pfizer /BioNtech and Moderna.While the Pfizer/BioNTech updated COVID-19 booster is approved for those aged 12 and above, Moderna's shot is approved for individuals aged 18 and above.These Omicron-tailored shots aim to tackle the BA.5 subvariants, which makes up a significant majority of the currently circulating variants in the United States, according to government data.

Their responses were compared to a group of six people who had COVID but did not experience a rebound. All volunteers had been vaccinated and boosted and all were infected with some version of the Omicron variant of the virus.Story continuesBlood from study volunteers underwent intensive investigation to assess their immune response during the acute infection phase and the rebound phase.All of the rebound patients had experienced significant improvement in their symptoms before their rebound. Of those who had a rebound after Paxlovid, four had milder symptoms than during their initial infection, one had the same level of severity and one reported worse symptoms.None of the rebound patients required additional treatment or hospitalization.Rebound symptoms may be partially driven by a robust immune response to residual virus in the respiratory tract, the study authors suggested. They concluded that the drug does not impede the immune response in some individuals, as some had feared.Larger and more detailed studies are needed to further understand COVID symptom rebound, the research team said, adding that the current data supports the need for isolation of such patients.The researchers also suggested that there is still a need to evaluate longer courses of Paxlovid in immunocompromised individuals where the immune response may be ineffective.

The Value Investor Podcast first launched in July 2016. It’s been over 6 years of episodes and we’ve finally reached the magical 300th episode. Thanks to everyone for listing through the ups and downs of the last few years.And thanks to the new listeners who have found the Value Investor Podcast in 2022 because value stocks are back in vogue.It’s a good time to be a value investor.Buffett’s Investing Advice in 2008However, 2022 has been rough for investors, whether in value or growth stocks. That’s why it always pays to consult with the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, for advice on what to do during a big stock market sell-off.And what was a bigger sell-off than the stock market in 2008 during the financial crisis?Buffett took pen to paper on Oct 16, 2008 and published an op-ed in the New York Times called: Buy American. I am. You can read it here.He said about 2008, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.”Buffett also warned that earnings could take a hit as businesses suffered through tough economic times but that he believed most companies would be setting new profit records 5, 10 or 20 years down the line.Sound familiar?Stay the CourseBuffett also advised that there will be dark times and that’s when investors should be buying. He said that in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was while inflation raged and the economy was in the tank.The stock market has a habit of rebounding well before a recession ends. Wall Street tends to “price in” all the bad news months ahead of time.Story continuesThat’s why it’s so difficult to try and time the bottom. Buffett said in 2008 he wasn’t going to try and time it for the short-term, as he had a long-term investing horizon.That’s good advice.5 Cheap Stocks That Pay Dividends1.       ExxonMobil XOMYou don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

Here's how to spot increasingly common scams,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zelle-heres-spot-increasingly-common-110044289.html,1665140444,STORY,"['USB', 'BAC', 'PYPL']","[Zelle is jointly run by seven major banks. Here, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), on a screen in the background, questions bank executives about the payment service during a Senate Banking Committee oversight hearing Sept. 22. (Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press)Credit cards and digital payment apps such as PayPal offer some distinct advantages over cash, including the ability to recover money paid to scammers.But Zelle, a digital payment network owned by seven major banks, isn't so protective of its users.If you use Zelle to pay someone who proves to be a con artist, you have only a slim chance of recovering the money from your bank. The same is true if you send money to the wrong person. If you hit Send, the money is probably gone — just as if you'd lost a $20 bill on the street.On its page for reporting scams, Zelle says: ""While we are unable to assist with getting your money back, it is important to us that users have the ability to report this experience. We will report the information you provide to the recipient’s bank or credit union to help prevent anyone else from having the same experience.""Some critics argue that Zelle and its banking partners are misinterpreting the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 and the regulation implementing it, which shield consumers from much of the liability for ""unauthorized"" transfers. Under the law, an unauthorized transfer is when someone else initiates a transfer from your account without your approval.According to Zelle and its partners, if you knowingly send cash to someone who's taking your money under false pretenses, that's an authorized transfer under the law. But under a class-action lawsuit filed in Orange County, the plaintiff — a college student who says she was conned out of $2,150 — argues that when someone induces you to send them money as part of a scam, that person is initiating a transfer without your authorization.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could try to settle this dispute, but it hasn't done so — yet. “Reports and consumer complaints of payments scams have risen sharply, and financial fraud can be devastating for victims,"" a CFPB spokesman said in response to an inquiry from The Times. ""The CFPB is working to prevent further harm, including by ensuring that financial institutions are living up to their investigation and error-resolution obligations.”Story continuesKevin Roundy, senior technical director of the internet security company NortonLifeLock in Culver City, said other payment systems see more scammers than Zelle: ""There are 30 times as many PayPal scams as Zelle scams,"" he said.""But I think [Zelle is] growing in popularity with scammers because it has some significant advantages from their perspective.""The main one, he said, is that the money transfer is almost instantaneous. ""It doesn’t give you the opportunity to hang up the phone, think about it for a few minutes, and go 'Oh, no.'""What is Zelle?Zelle is a peer-to-peer payment system operated by Early Warning Services, an Arizona tech company owned by Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank, Capital One and Truist. Last month it marked its fifth anniversary by announcing that it had handled more than 5 billion transactions involving $1.5 trillion.Consumers enroll in Zelle through one of more than 1,700 participating banks or through the Zelle app, then use it to send money directly from their bank account to another Zelle user's bank account. The transfer takes a few minutes or less to complete, and in most cases, there are no fees paid by either the sender or the recipient. (Zelle leaves the fees up to its banking partners, and most of them don't charge any, said Meghan Fintland, the company's senior director of external communications.)The process is different from using checks, credit cards and digital payment systems such as PayPal in at least two important ways.First, because the transfer goes swiftly from bank account to bank account, there is no entity holding onto the money while the transaction is verified or before it's collected.And second, because no fees are charged, Zelle isn't building up a reserve to cover the fraud losses incurred by consumers on the platform. Credit card companies, by contrast, charge fees on every transaction.Still, Zelle wouldn't have trouble figuring out where any disputed payments went. People can't collect money through Zelle without enrolling their U.S. bank or credit union account into the system.What types of scams are on Zelle?Early Warning Services touted its safety record in a statement this week, saying, ""Tens of millions of consumers use Zelle without incident, with more than 99.9% of payments completed without any report of fraud or scam. Zelle usage has grown significantly since its launch, from 247 million transactions in 2017 to 1.8 billion in 2021, while the proportion of fraud and scams has steadily decreased.""A new report from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), on the other hand, estimates that the number of scam and fraud complaints on Zelle has increased rapidly in recent years. Note that both things could be true — as Zelle usage increases, the number of complaints about scams could rise while the percentage drops. Scam and fraud claims from Zelle users are on pace to increase 183% at four banks her office surveyed, from more than $90 million in 2020 to more than $255 million in 2022.""Increasingly, customers are being defrauded through sophisticated deceptions involving a bad actor’s use of a reputable institution’s name or branding to induce a fraudulent payment — known as 'spoofing' — or a bad actor’s use of a consumer’s own contact information to disguise a payment to the bad actor’s account as a payment to the consumer’s account — known as 'me-to-me,'"" Warren's report says.Sadly, these sorts of scams are growing increasingly familiar to anyone with a smartphone and a bank account, regardless of whether they use Zelle, Venmo, PayPal or another payment system. In a spoofing scam, you'll get an email, a text or a call that appears to come from a person or business you know, urging you to pay them through Zelle — in some cases, ironically, to protect yourself from a purported fraud. In the me-to-me scam, someone pretending to be from your bank tries to persuade you to send money to yourself through Zelle, while in the process hijacking your Zelle account with your help.And even people who reported unauthorized Zelle transfers had trouble getting help from their banks, Warren's report says. Data from Bank of America, U.S. Bank, PNC Bank and Truist indicate that these customers recovered less than half the money they lost in 2021 and the first half of 2022.Adylia Roman of Westwood is one of the Zelle users who tried in vain to recover money from transfers that she insists weren't authorized.She shares a Bank of America savings account with her son, who received an email from the bank in April notifying him of a problem with the account. When her son called, Roman said, the bank told him about three back-to-back transfers from the account on April 18 that totaled $2,700. He knew nothing about the transfers or the recipient, a woman named ""Marie,"" and definitely never authorized them, Roman said. Bank of America said it would investigate.A consumer who reports an unauthorized electronic funds transfer within two days is liable for no more than $50 of the loss, under federal rules. A consumer who waits longer to report the fraud could be liable for up to $500.About a week later, Roman said, Bank of America sent a letter saying the transfers had involved an authorized device and had been validated by an authorized phone number — points that Roman and her son dispute. It said the case was closed, offering no chance to appeal and no help in recovering the money from the scammer.When she contacted Zelle, Roman said, she was told there was nothing the company could do. Her son, meanwhile, feels intimidated and blamed by Bank of America for a problem he didn't cause.Betty Riess, a spokesperson for Bank of America, said customers whose requests for reimbursement are rejected ""can always request an additional review."" And in cases when customers are scammed, she said, ""We do reach out to the recipient bank to see if we can recover the money.""How to use Zelle safelyZelle instructs users in the process of making a payment to be sure to send money only to people they know and trust. It's good advice, and it addresses part of the threat posed by scammers.""If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is,"" Zelle says on its website. ""For example, is a stranger selling online concert tickets at a steep discount and insisting you pay with Zelle? Think twice."" Better yet, just say no.There are other options better suited for purchasing items and services because they have mechanisms for recovering your money when you're scammed. Venmo, for example, offers something it calls purchase protection for transactions involving goods or services. PayPal offers its own version.Zelle also tells users to confirm the recipient's mobile phone number or email address before sending money. Remember, if you make a mistake, Zelle and its banking partners will say that's your problem, not theirs.That leaves the threat of spoofing, in which scammers try to hide behind the names and brands you ""know and trust."" They do so by using fake email addresses and phone numbers, or by timing a phone call to make it appear to be a response from your bank to a suspicious text you just received (that they just sent).How do you guard against these sorts of attacks? Experts offer the following tips:If it's an email, look carefully at the sender's address. Spoofers often create domains that are slightly different from the one they're impersonating — for example, customerservice@wellsfrgo.com — or that use a generic domain — say, wellsfargo_customer_service@hotmail.com. If the sender's domain doesn't match the company's, it's not from the company.Pro tip from the security firm Kaspersky Labs: Look at the entire email header, if your email software lets you do so. Official emails from your U.S.-based bank should not originate overseas.If it's a text warning you about Zelle fraud, do not reply to the text. Call your bank's fraud hotline instead. Brian Krebs, a journalist who specializes in online security issues, described how this Zelle scam works: The scammer sends you a text purportedly from your bank, asking if you'd just tried to make a (fictitious) payment through Zelle. If you respond, that lets the scammer know you have a Zelle account — so the scammer then calls you, pretending to be someone from your bank's anti-fraud unit. Then you are asked to reveal something that will help the scammer take your money. If you do, you've been had.Scammers might also tell you that to stop the suspicious payment from being made, you need to send the amount in question through Zelle to a safe account at the bank, Roundy said. But that's not a safe account — it's the scammer's, and you will be filling it.Similarly, Roundy said, don't use a Zelle address sent in a text to pay a bill. If you get a message that purports to be from a government agency or service provider, and it invites you to pay your bill via a Zelle address provided in the text, it's almost certainly a scam. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time, the legitimate institutions aren’t sending you a request for payment through Zelle,"" he said.More generally, do not reveal anything to an unknown caller, texter or emailer professing to be from your bank, no matter how persuasive their credentials are or how urgent the supposed problem with Zelle is. Instead, call the bank yourself, on the number listed on the back of your ATM card, to see if there is a problem with your account. And never, ever, ever reveal a two-factor-authentication code you receive from your bank, even to a caller who appears to be from your bank.Watch how a me-to-me scam works, as explained by Patrick McKenzie, a software engineer at the payments company Stripe: You get a call from a scammer who claims to be from your bank, saying that someone has made an unauthorized transfer. To stop the fraud, you are told, you need to Zelle money to your own phone number. The scammer says the bank will send you a code via text to confirm, which the scammer will ask you to read aloud. Unbeknownst to you, however, the text from your bank is actually a two-factor-authentication code that will allow the scammer to assign a different phone number — the scammer's — to your Zelle account. So when you send money from your bank via Zelle to yourself, you're actually sending it to the scammer.Roundy said Zelle ""definitely has great use cases,"" particularly when you're sending money to people you know or can validate. But you need to be extremely careful when you send money to a person or business ""where you’re not 100% sure of the provenance of an account.""More safety tipsTaking a safety-first approach to the internet generally will help protect you against scams on Zelle and other payment platforms. This starts with using two-factor authentication wherever it is offered to protect your accounts. And it's more secure to use an authenticator app on your phone instead of text messages as the second factor.If you aren't doing it already, filter out spam calls. Fraudsters do their work at scale, spamming scores of potential victims in search of a few gullible ones. The more times you answer a robocall (or respond to a spam email), the more you'll invite the attention of other scammers.Many smartphones running Apple or Android operating systems have built-in filters for unknown callers. There are also numerous apps offered by mobile phone networks and third-party developers; the Federal Communications Commission offers a partial list on its website.Or you could do what my wife does, and send every call from someone not in her contact list straight to voicemail. Legitimate callers will leave a message.Don't click on attachments in unsolicited emails. That's one of the main ways online criminals distribute malware.While you're at it, don't click on links in emails from unknown senders. And even if you think you know the sender, make sure you know where the link would take you before you click on it. On a computer, you can right-click on the link with your mouse to copy it, then paste it into a text app to check the web address. Or you can hover over the link with your mouse, which should cause the URL to be displayed in a pop-up window. On a smartphone, pressing and holding a link should display the URL. If the address starts with ""http:"" instead of ""https:"", that's a big red flag.Never, ever click on a link in a text to reset your password. That's ""highly likely"" to be a scam, Kaspersky Labs warns. The company also says that financial institutions won't ask for personal information via text, so that's another tipoff when you're dealing with a scammer.What to do if you are defraudedAs noted above, Zelle will field your complaints about scammers on its website, but you won't get your money back that way. Nevertheless, if you've been conned into sending someone money under false pretenses, you are the victim of a crime. So you should report it to law enforcement, including the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.If money has been siphoned out of your bank account through a truly unauthorized transfer, Zelle's policy calls for your bank to cover 100% of your loss, Fintland said. You should report the transfer(s) to your bank or, if you signed up through the Zelle app, report it to Zelle at (844) 428-8542.However, banks will first investigate to determine whether the claim is valid, Fintland said.That's where some fraud victims say they are running into roadblocks.Numerous media outlets have told of Zelle users who were defrauded but unable to recover their funds from their bank. And Warren's office flatly states in its report, ""Banks are not repaying customers who contest 'unauthorized' Zelle payments — potentially violating federal law and CFPB rules.""Frank Hirsch, a lawyer of counsel with Kaufman &amp; Canoles, noted that there are several class-action suits pending from Zelle users victimized by scammers. The plaintiffs argue that there should be no difference between a fraudster who hacks into your Zelle account to siphon off money and a fraudster who cons you into sending the money. ""In both cases,"" Hirsch said, ""you're defrauded.""But the Electronic Fund Transfer Act was passed long before the commercial internet existed. Hirsch predicted that the question of whether banks have to reimburse Zelle users for fraudulently induced transfers is ""likely to persist in the courts for a while until somebody says the Electronic Fund Transfer Act does not apply or does apply.""""There’s many kind of circumstances where we’re trying to define where the line is drawn,"" he said. ""It’s difficult — particularly when you’re talking about new technologies"" that entered the marketplace after the law was passed.""But honestly, that is in part why we have a CFPB, and why we have an FTC [Federal Trade Commission], and why we have these regulators who are supposed to try to suss out and explain to the actors whether they have to comply with certain rules.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

If you want to read about some more financial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now.Unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the past few years have helped finance stocks demonstrate their ability to be resilient during times of crisis, boosting investor confidence and resulting in a flurry of new activity in the sector. However, per research firm Deloitte, the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of regional or global recession in 2023 still loom as near-term challenges for the industry, as more regulation and requirements around transparency also become marketplace realities. Some of the best finance stocks to monitor in this macro environment include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). As rising interest rates increase the earnings of banks overnight, recession fears continue to make investors think twice about investments in the sector. In this context, banks are leaning on the lessons learned from the uncertainty of the past few years to focus on smart strategy and execution that relies on talent, technology, risk, and purpose to drive growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the financial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Best Financial Stocks To Buy NowInvestments, FinanceBest Financial Stocks To Buy Now14. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29   Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The company recently said it resolved technical issues that had prevented US bank account users from making payments or withdrawals for most of the day. The firm has been on a downward spiral in the last few weeks on the back of worsening crypto futures even as analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto technology. Story continuesOn September 14, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained a Neutral rating on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock and raised the price target to $78 from $64, highlighting that Coinbase has a substantial revenue opportunity that originates from higher interest rates.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $2.3 billion. Just like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US. It is one of the top financial stocks to invest in. Reports indicate that a recent phishing campaign has targeted the bank's new partnership with verification service Authentify. In the campaign, thousands of scam emails were sent to the bank's customers to try and trick them into uploading images of their identification cards. On September 26. Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker maintained a Neutral rating on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $125, noting that the rapid rise in Fed funds combined with outsized loan growth has led to a significant increase in funding costs for digitally-based depositories. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), with 7.85 million shares worth more than $818 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a financial holding company that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals. It is one of the premier financial stocks to invest in. In August 2022, the company filed with the SEC to launch six ESG ETFs, the first foray into the US ETF space since the pioneering WEBS products were introduced in the 1990s. The proposed ETFs are likely to be listed in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in early 2023.On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stock and lowered the price target to $92 from $105. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with 13.98 million shares worth more than $1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is one of the world’s leading investment banks and wealth management firms. As the company has grown its wealth management business its earnings have become more predictable and valuable. The management team is very shareholder-friendly, allocating funds not needed to grow the business to repurchase shares and raise their dividend. In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide.

(NYSE:FIS), compared to 68 in the preceding quarter worth $3.95 billion. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a financial institution that provides a range of financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It is one of the most prominent financial stocks to invest in. The bank recently announced that it was expanding Transaction Banking to the European Union.

(NYSE:GS), compared to 71 the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement.

(NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view.

The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83    Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. Mike Santomassimo, the CFO of the firm, recently said that lending growth is moderating from strong levels seen during the second quarter as the US economy slows.

(NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

(NASDAQ:PYPL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 73% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PayPal Holdings. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PayPal Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PayPal Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PayPal Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. PayPal Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.6% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PayPal HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that PayPal Holdings, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$133m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in PayPal Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with PayPal Holdings , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

""The supply chain is going to start here and end here, in the United States.""Government funding is essential to boost manufacturing and ensure U.S. national security by producing critical goods now made abroad, Biden said. His administration and fellow Democrats have directed billions in federal funding to encourage private- sector spending and create jobs.IBM's announcement is the latest in a string of investments unveiled since Biden signed the Chips and Science bill in August which funded $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor chips manufacturing and research.""America invented these chips,"" Biden said.Hefty subsidies for private businesses are necessary because China and the European Union had been awarding billions in incentives to chip companies, the White House says.Biden has sought to capitalize on the investment announcements ahead of next month's midterm congressional elections. Last month, he traveled to Ohio to speak at the site of Intel Corp's planned $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility.The Hudson Valley, home of IBM's Poughkeepsie site, was an economic powerhouse during America's Industrial Revolution, but regional jobs dried up during the second half of the last century, as companies fled to lower-cost locations.Story continuesIBM, which laid off thousands of people in the region in the 1990s when it moved chip and other manufacturing, said it now plans to make the site ""a global hub of the company's quantum computing development, just as it is today for mainframes.""IBM did not provide a detailed breakdown of its $20 billion investment plans.The White House said it was sparked by Biden's economic policies.""The industrial strategy is really helping to drive a renaissance in American manufacturing, and domestic investment ... that we haven’t seen in generations,"" White House National Economic Director Brian Deese told reporters en route to the IBM site.On Tuesday, Micron Technology said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a semiconductor fabrication facility in New York that is expected to create nearly 50,000 jobs, with the first phase investment of $20 billion planned this decade.Biden was joined by IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna.

212,a66e318f-e5d4-349c-a8a9-0c57321dda20,TAP,2022-10-07,How liquor brands are shrugging off the family-run ethos to better diversify their workforces,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liquor-brands-shrugging-off-family-180000898.html,1665079200,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[Studies have frequently shown that ethnic and gender diversity on executive teams results in financial outperformance for the companies that are more inclusive.That data makes the business case for strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) an easy sell at alcohol producer Constellation Brands, where top leaders say the need is even more pronounced for consumer-driven brands. People want to see themselves in the brands they buy, Constellation contends, and thus diversity of thought internally will be well received externally.“We see diversity as something that is absolutely critical to the future success of our business,” says Mike McGrew, chief communications, CSR (corporate social responsibility), and diversity officer at Constellation.The purveyor of Corona beer, Kim Crawford wine, and Svedka vodka has vowed to boost diverse representation by 50% across the company’s U.S. workforce over the next five years. The company’s current workforce is very white at 80%—far above the 60% representation for that group across the entire U.S. population. The commitment Constellation Brands has made to become more ethnically inclusive would mean that in half a decade, 30% of the company’s workforce would self-identify as Black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, Asian, or another Person of Color.Constellation Brands also wants to boost gender representation to parity. Women make up close to 40% of the company’s U.S. employee base today.There’s also been a boost in diverse representation at Constellation’s board and executive levels over the past few years, changes to the team that have been a passion project for Bill Newlands, the company’s CEO.The inclusivity commitments are part of a broader push at the company to develop diversity of representation across every level of the organization. Constellation believes that by having more diverse thoughts, they can stay ahead of Americans’ ever-evolving shifting drinking patterns.Story continuesMcGrew explains there are three areas that Constellation Brands is particularly keen to address: enhancing diverse representation across the business, educating teams to ensure an inclusive culture thrives as the composition of the company changes, and encouraging broader social impact in the alcohol industry and within the communities Constellation Brands operates.The latter commitment explains why Constellation Brands has outlined plans to invest $100 million in women-led startups by 2028, and $100 million, separately, in Black, Latinx, and minority-owned businesses by 2030. Already, Constellation has acquired stakes in La Fête du Rosé, Archer Roose, and Sapere Aude Sparking Wine; and fully acquired female-founded Austin Cocktails earlier this year.“We are actively investing in high potential founders and big disruptive ideas,” says Mallika Monteiro, chief growth, strategy, and digital officer at Constellation. “That’s good for our business, good for them, and certainly good for the industry.”Making leadership at major alcohol brands is likely to be a long, ongoing process. Take a look at the various family-run businesses across major categories like Scotch whisky, American bourbon, or the champagne houses in France. All overwhelmingly white. And when many of these brands are sold to major alcohol conglomerates, there’s a strong preference to maintain the family-run feel of these brands—meaning that many leaders, master distillers, and the marketing faces behind those brands remain exclusionary to one racial group.Constellation Brands believes that for recruitment, it wants to look outside the industry and reach out to audiences that haven’t always been included in the past. A fairly new, entry level sales recruitment program in Texas and other states in the South are courting talent from historically Black colleges and universities.“We coach and train people managers and hiring managers to think about what skill sets they need, rather than just look at the historical company experience,” says Kris Carey, chief human resources officer at Constellation.DEI and creating a more inclusive culture is also a priority at Molson Coors, the parent company of Coors Light and Miller Lite. The company hosts a monthly DEI town hall and each October celebrates an annual “Month of Inclusion,” which includes keynote speakers and interactive sessions to inspire candid conversations related to inclusion. The company’s pubs—at corporate offices located in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Denver—are tapped to host various events held by employee resource groups that support Black employees, women, LGBTQ+, veterans, and more.“We are on a journey here and there’s been a lot of really good work that’s been done around DEI over the last couple years,” says Harmony Lussier, senior manager of talent acquisition at Molson Coors.Molson Coors has committed to invest $100 million by 2025 in initiatives that “aspire to improve livelihoods, champion diversity, foster empowerment and build resilient communities.”More broadly in addressing the workplace for all, Molson Coors has implemented a hybrid schedule in which all employees come to the office three days a week, on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. The dress code at Molson Coors has evolved from “business casual” to merely “casual.”“We think the schedule here at Molson Coors works, as we try to rebuild a real sense of community,” says Lussier. “People value being with their teams, it increases energy levels, the pace in which you can get work done is much quicker, and it lends itself to a more productive environment.”Even the office bar has evolved. Molson Coors’ pubs have reopened after closure during the height of the pandemic. Brands like Keystone Light or Topo Chico Hard Seltzer are back to hosting events to celebrate campaigns. Executives take turns behind the bar to pour drinks for their colleagues. And working parents have asked to get more involved in the festivities. The pubs now open one hour early, one day a week, to allow parents an opportunity to socialize before going home to their families.As a result, Molson Coors’ pubs are always packed on Thursdays.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com.]"

If a customer had a pre-order but no delivery date, the customer would be subject to new pricing.Back when Ford debuted the F-150 Lightning and said the base pro model would come in under a $40,000 MSRP, it was a shot across the bow to the EV competition that Ford would use its engineering know-how, manufacturing efficiencies, and deep supplier relationships to win on pricing.Now it seems reality is getting in the way of Ford's pricing strategy.Ford CEO Jim Farley speaks during the official launch of the all-new Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S. April 26, 2022. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook“Being able to launch the model with a $40,000 price tag makes a big splash with the media, but that price was obviously not sustainable with today’s rate of inflation, especially when it comes to battery materials,” Sam Fiorani, VP of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Yahoo Finance. “Supply chain issues and global inflation is causing all manufacturers to reevaluate their prices. Combine this with a high-profile model that was launched with established pre-inflation prices, and Ford had no choice but to make adjustments.”As for whether Ford miscalculated its pricing strategy versus its competition, such as GM (GM) and Tesla (TSLA), Fiorani believes no automaker could have handled it better.Story continues“The pricing pressures are industry wide. Tesla raised its prices recently, GM has backed off saying the Equinox would be under $30,000, [and] now they are saying it will be ‘around $30,000',” he said. “From the time Ford announced pricing for the Lightning, inflation has hit the industry quite hard; it was just inopportune timing that they released the Lightning at this time.”That being said, Fiorani believes the Lightning is the “perfect vehicle for Ford to absorb some of these added costs” because demand from early adopters is high, inventories of the vehicle are light, and factory space needed to make more of the Lightnings is limited.It's not all bad news for Ford, however. Fiorani says these higher prices will help Ford further fund its EV transition, perhaps in time help the company develop cheaper EVs down the road.—Pras Subramanian is a senior autos reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at McCormick (NYSE:MKC) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McCormick:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$990m ÷ (US$13b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).Therefore, McCormick has an ROCE of 10%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.8%. Check out our latest analysis for McCormick roceIn the above chart we have measured McCormick's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of McCormick's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 22% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.On a related note, McCormick has decreased its current liabilities to 24% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From McCormick's ROCEIn summary, McCormick is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Since the stock has gained an impressive 58% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing McCormick, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.While McCormick isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

This compares to earnings of $0.80 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this spices and seasonings company would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of -26.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.McCormick , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $1.6 billion for the quarter ended August 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.55 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.McCormick shares have lost about 24.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.6%.What's Next for McCormick?While McCormick has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for McCormick: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.93 on $1.78 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.65 on $6.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the bottom 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.MGP (MGPI), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This producer of distillery and ingredients products used by the packaged goods industry is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.1%.

UAL is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. Recovery in business travel demand has also picked up pace. With this, the company expects to be profitable in the third quarter, like the second quarter of 2022.On the back of this robust demand environment, UAL provides bullish revenue guidance for third-quarter 2022. For the third quarter, United Airlines anticipates total operating revenues to grow almost 12% from the September quarter of 2019, higher than the prior expected growth rate of about 11% (provided during the company’s second-quarter 2022 earnings release on Jul 20).The company expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase by around 25% in the third quarter from the comparable period’s number in 2019 (previous view: up in the 24-26% band). Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is anticipated to increase roughly 16% in the September quarter from the corresponding quarter of 2019 (previous view: 16-17%). The adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 10.5% in the September quarter, higher than the prior guidance of 10%.The positivity surrounding the stock is evident from the northward movement of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings, which has improved 21.9% over the past 90 days.On the flip side, rising fuel costs pose a threat to United Airlines’ bottom line. Oil price is moving north primarily because Russia invaded Ukraine. The carrier reported an average aircraft fuel price per gallon of $4.18 in the second quarter, up 93.5% year over year. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.83 in the third quarter, much higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2021.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesSome better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector are ZTO Express ZTO, Air Lease Corporation AL and Teekay Tankers Ltd.

Unfortunately, that all-time high was just 23 companies - or less than 5% -- of the 500 included on the annual list.While workplace representation is just one metric, that statistic is a stark reminder of the ponderous pace at which the world is moving toward gender financial equality. According to the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Report, it will take 257 years to close the economic gender gap.To highlight both the gap and the time required to close it, PNC is recognizing Project 257® Day on September 14, the 257th day of this year. Like the initiative it's named for, Project 257 Day serves as a reminder that - while we still have a long way to go - we are making progress, particularly in relation to two of PNC's key areas of focus in the past year: access to credit for women and representation in the workplace.I'm proud to share some of the accomplishments we've achieved in the year since we launched Project 257: Accelerating Women's Financial Equality initiative:PNC's partnership with Coralus generated 30% of the venture applications for Coralus Ventures last year. Formerly known as SheEO, Coralus is a global nonprofit organization that provides zero-interest loans to select women- and nonbinary-led ventures who are working on the World's To-Do List - the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. More than 50 PNC employees received ""Activations"" as part of the initial partnership. They are supporting the Coralus ecosystem by offering guidance and making connections to help ventures grow and thrive. They're also spreading the word about Coralus across the country, with a goal of helping the organization identify even more Activators because for every 100 new Activators, Coralus can grant another six-figure no-interest loan to a venture. To celebrate our one-year anniversary as a Coralus partner, PNC is expanding the relationship. Back in 2021, we committed $1.257 million to Coralus over a 3-year period. In August 2022, we announced the additional gift of Coralus Activations to 200 businesses through 2024. We've seen the positive impact that Coralus has had on the entrepreneurs who participate, and our hope is to not only gift this exposure to more entrepreneurs, but also increase the organization's perpetual loan pool so that more businesses can be funded.PNC established an enterprise-wide Project 257 Task Force to identify and catalog the work that's been done, the work we have planned and the synergistic opportunities to continue our efforts to close the financial gender gap. With dozens of business lines and teams, and 54 regional markets across the nation, we know that the whole of our activities aimed to support women financial decision makers is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, the task force is uncovering the myriad relationships PNC's Community Development Banking group has with Community Development Financial Institutions across the country that, like Coralus, are helping to increase access to capital to underrepresented entrepreneurs.We continue to look for opportunities to create space for women to be represented in the workforce through external programs, too, including:New this year, our Women in Motorsports partnership with Chip Ganassi Racing added an internship program to engage a select group of women college students in on-site learning and career-development experiences during the 2022 NTT INDYCAR SERIES season. The women worked as mechanics and engineers and in other roles traditionally held by men. Applications for the 2023 intern class are open now through September 30, 2022.Another new partnership is with Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit organization working to close the gender gap in technology and to change the image of what a programmer looks like and does. TechConnect, an affinity group of PNC women in technology roles, is collaborating with Girls Who Code to inspire young women to choose a career in technology and create opportunities for the organization's alums within PNC.We continued our Women in eSports program in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Knights, championing women in the esports industry who are leading the charge as well as fostering lasting change.Story continuesThe wheels of progress are definitely in motion, but if the work was easy, we wouldn't be facing a 257-year gap. We remain committed to our efforts to identify and celebrate successes, while we flag and address our shortfalls and identify the opportunities that still lie ahead.Project 257 Day serves as a celebration of the work we've done, a reminder of the potential we have yet to realize and, hopefully, a source of inspiration for others to join us on this journey.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719327/257-Years-Is-Too-Long-To-Wait]"

That's because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses - and with people generally living longer, the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.25 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.26%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.39% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.63% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.77% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 3.77%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.62% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new substation is expected to provide 240 megawatts (MW) of power in its initial phase and will eventually accommodate up to 1,000 MW in the future.In addition, Potomac Edison plans to reenergize a 230-kV transmission line, which previously served the property for supporting the campus. As part of the project, two transformers will be installed to reduce the high-voltage electricity coming from the substation and convert it into low-voltage power, allowing it to be effectively delivered to Quantum Frederick buildings.Need for Infrastructure UpgradeElectricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities maintained by utilities have the possibility of an equipment breakdown or failure due to the aging infrastructure. This requires the construction of new cutting-edge technology and equipment.As the demand for electricity rises in Frederick due to continued growth, this new substation will increase the capacity of the distribution system and help lessen the frequency and length of power outages for thousands of customers.FirstEnergy plans to invest $3.3 billion in 2022 and $17 billion in the 2021-2025 period to strengthen the grid and lead a clean energy transition. On Jul 15, 2022, FirstEnergy filed the new four-year Grid Mod II program with the Ohio commission, proposing a $626-million capital investment to expand the deployment of Grid Mod technologies and help reduce the frequency of power outages.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, FirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

236,1adb6473-3e9d-30b9-ba20-c10fd6db14cd,PNW,2022-10-07,The 7 Best Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-mid-cap-stocks-233041336.html,1664815541,STORY,"['PNW', 'HESM']","[Although a certain appeal exists in a decisive positional directive, in some cases, a balanced approach is ideal, thus amplifying the relevance of the best mid-cap stocks to buy. Neither too hot nor too cold, these middle-lane enterprises deliver a mix of upside growth opportunities and proven stability. Given the wild circumstances of the wider economy, these names will almost certainly command attention among concerned investors.Here’s the deal. With the Federal Reserve committed to attacking soaring inflation by raising the benchmark interest rate, recession risks have risen. That’s because the latest hotter-than-expected jobs report indicates that the central bank still has much work left. With higher borrowing costs seemingly a given at this point, the best mid-cap stocks to buy offer significant intrigue.Under a tightened money supply environment, purely growth-centric names (the small-capitalization firms) present too much risk. However, the blue-chip stalwarts may offer performances too boring for upside-seeking investors. Ultimately, then, the best mid-cap stocks to buy take the best of both worlds. Below are enticing ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy: West Fraser Timber (WFG)A stack of timber in a forest representing timber and logging company stocksSource: shutterstock.com/VictorNHeadquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, West Fraser Timber (NYSE:WFG) is a Canadian forestry company that produces lumber and other specialized wood-based products such as pulp and plywood. Currently, West Fraser commands a market cap of 7.86 billion CAD (translating to roughly $5.81 billion). On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, WFG has dipped nearly 24%.Fundamentally, what justifies the inclusion of WFG among the best mid-cap stocks to buy centers on its overall financial resilience. For instance, the company enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 2.65 times, beating out over 80% of sector players. Additionally, its Altman Z-Score is 4.53, reflecting low bankruptcy risk.Story continuesOn the income front, West Fraser features a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%, above 87% of the industry. As well, the company benefits from excellent profit margins across the board. In particular, its gross margin of almost 50% implies potentially robust economies of scale, thus facilitating flexibility.Finally, analysts rate WFG as a consensus moderate buy based on four buys and two holds. Presently, the average price target is $98.96, reflecting nearly 38% upside (from the time-of-writing price).IPG Photonics (IPGP)A photo of a purple and green laser going through an objectSource: science photo / ShutterStock.comAn American manufacturer of fiber lasers, IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP) specializes in technologies that are used in a variety of applications including materials processing, medical applications and telecommunications. At the moment, IPG Photonics commands a market cap of $4.52 billion. Admittedly, the narrative presents significant risks for market participants. Since the start of the year, shares have fallen almost 47%.Nevertheless, IPGP makes an intriguing case for the best mid-cap stocks to buy now. For one thing, the volatility in the back half of the year died down substantially. In the trailing month, shares actually gained a bit over 4%, reflecting a possible early-stage recovery.On the financials, IPG enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet, particularly with its cash-to-debt ratio of 57.1 times. While its growth metrics could use improvement, the company makes up for it with solid profit margins.Finally, analysts rate IPGP as a consensus moderate buy with a price target of $118.75. That’s about a 28% upside from the time-of-writing price. As well, hedge funds have been building up a position in IPGP since the first quarter of 2021.Best Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy: Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) is an American building materials manufacturer. As such, the company offers a contrarian take on the housing market. If you believe in a future building boom, LPX could be your ticket to riches. Presently, Louisiana-Pacific carries a market cap of $4.32 billion. Shares are down nearly 23% YTD.To be sure, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is down 20% for the year, meaning that LPX represents an obvious underperformer. Still, shares did gain almost 18% in the trailing six months. Financially, LPX belongs on this list of best mid-cap stocks to buy for its lack of any glaring vulnerabilities. Per GuruFocus, the company features only two yellow flags and no red flags.Of course, this leaves plenty of positives for investors to mull over. For instance, the company features a solid balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of nearly eight. In addition, Louisiana-Pacific enjoys excellent revenue and profit margins. As well, the market prices LPX at four times trailing-12-month earnings, which is extremely undervalued.Finally, analysts rate LPX as a consensus moderate buy. Wall Street experts anticipate an average price target of $73, reflecting 21% upside.Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO)SIMO stock: Silicon Motion Technology logo on the side of its headquartersSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockBased out of Taiwan, Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) focuses on developing NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. At the moment, Silicon Motion features a market cap of $2.1 billion. Since the beginning of the year, SIMO has dropped 33%. However, in the trailing month, shares gained slightly over 4%.To be sure, Silicon suffered from at least a double whammy (if not more). First, the semiconductor industry suffered from the global supply chain disruption. Second, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China cloud SIMO’s overall narrative. Still, Beijing’s move to relax its border restrictions reflects a focus on economic recovery initiatives. And in the long run, this framework should spark normalization trends in the semiconductor space.Financially, SIMO more than justifies its inclusion as one of the best mid-cap stocks to buy. Primarily, the company features zero debt, affording it incredible flexibility. Also, it features solid revenue growth and strong profit margins. Finally, the market prices SIMO at less than 10 times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16.9 times.Best Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy: ArcBest (ARCB)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockOperating out of Arkansas, ArcBest (NASDAQ:ARCB) is an American holding company for truckload and less-than-truckload freight, freight brokerage, household goods moving, and transportation management companies. Presently, ArcBest commands a market cap of $1.73 billion. Since the beginning of this year, ARCB dropped over 37% of its equity value.Fundamentally, the contrarian case for ARCB as one of the best mid-cap stocks to buy centers on hopeful economic normalization. Better yet, investors seem to be recognizing this hypothesis as a non-zero probability. In the trailing half-year period, ARCB is up 1%. Also, it’s worth pointing out that according to TipRanks, ARCB features a strong buy consensus rating.Notably, no analyst currently has a sell rating. As well, the average price target stands at $114.80. That’s a staggering 62.19% upside from the time-of-writing price.Adding to the enticing profile, GuruFocus labels ArcBest as modestly undervalued. Currently, the market prices ARCB at 7.5 times forward earnings. In contrast, the median for the transportation industry is nearly 12 times.B2Gold (BTG)b2gold (BTG) logo on a web browser enlarged by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comA Canadian mining firm, B2Gold (NYSEMKT:BTG) owns and operates gold mines in Mali, Namibia and the Philippines. Currently, the company carries a market cap of 5.19 billion CAD (or approximately $3.84 billion). Interestingly, BTG has lost less than 4% of its equity value since its January opener. Even better, in the trailing month, shares gained slightly more than 10%.Fundamentally, this narrative appears to contrast with the Fed’s hawkish policy. Effectively, tightening the money supply translates to the integration of deflationary forces. And deflation usually bodes very poorly for commodities such as precious metals.However, another overriding factor appears to bolster BTG and its ilk: fear. With many investors concerned about economic stability, they may seek the shelter of assets with intrinsic value. Since most arguably don’t want to carry around bulky bullion, gold miners represent a convenient alternative. Thus, BTG makes for a contrarian case among the best mid-cap stocks to buy.Also, analysts rate B2Gold as a consensus strong buy. Adding more confidence to the above thesis, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment toward BTG is very positive.Best Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy: Grand Canyon Education (LOPE)Black college graduation cap laying on a pile of $100 and $20 dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/zimmytwsAn interesting but risky case among the best mid-cap stocks to buy, Grand Canyon Education (NASDAQ:LOPE) represents a Christian university. Ideologically, demand may rise for (relatively) affordable private higher education undergirded by strong ethical values. Presently, Grand Canyon carries a market cap of $3.33 billion. Since the start of the year, LOPE gained 22%, largely based on a strong Q3 earnings performance.At the same time, some concerns exist about buying into positive momentum, especially under these circumstances. Still, the New York Times posted an interesting article that could explain LOPE’s outstanding performance. As a private institution, Grand Canyon can keep its curriculum focused on core subjects.I’m not making a case for such issues one way or the other. However, people are voting, and they’re voting to keep politics out of academics. That’s a potential catalyst for LOPE.And while it’s only among three covering analysts, Grand Canyon enjoys a strong buy consensus view. Sure enough, after a big drought, hedge funds are slowly starting to LOPE’s upside proposition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Hockey.JULIE HYMAN: That I know. That much I know. That much I know. And so it looks like we've got a lower open here in New York--- Let's go Rangers!JULIE HYMAN: --City, despite the enthusiasm there.[CLAPPING]Oh, ""Let's go Rangers.""BRIAN SOZZI: Is that Mark Messier on there?- Let's go Rangers!BRIAN SOZZI: I can't tell. What's the bald guy?JULIE HYMAN: They got a chant going. All right, all right, let's talk about the markets, folks. You're Rangers, great.- Let's go Rangers!JULIE HYMAN: I know how much all of our producers love sports, but let's take a look at what's going on with the markets because we've got a pause in the rally that we've been seeing as of late. And now, we've got all three major averages opening in the red.The Dow actually leading the way downward here today. And I know Brad is taking a look at some of the groups that are on the move.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, we are pretty much red across the board, except for one bright spot, which I want to zero in on a hot second there. And that is XLY, consumer discretionary. But we've got 11 out of-- or 10 out of 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors right now in negative territory to start off the day.I mentioned that zero in on consumer discretionary. As of right now, holding on to slight gains, by the hair of chinny-chin-chin of about 1/10 of percent. And here's why I want to go further into that. You've had a lot of news come out in the retail landscape here today.And diving into the retail heat map, as we kick off today's trading session. I'm just gonna make this equal, give us a good look at a lot of the names as they're trending here on the day. And you still do have a lot of positive momentum.Story continuesKeep a close eye on Target, TGT, that is a company that's kicking off some of its Deal Days today, October 6 through 8. And that really comes as we're seeing some of the holiday sales get pulled earlier in the year. We've seen that from Target. We've seen that from Walmart as well.Not to be confused with Target's Deal Days, Walmart's Deals for Days. That's gonna go live next Monday, October 10, and that's gonna run through the 13. And then after that-- or within it, rather, you've got Amazon's Prime Early Access Sale, October 11 through 12.So I'm keeping a close eye on Target here on the day. That's holding on to some gains at the open. You've also had some deal-making as well take place. Walmart buying Alert Innovation. And so we'll continue to see exactly where Walmart moves from here. You're seeing those shares hold on to slight gains, fractional gains, by about 4/10 of percent.And since I mentioned Walmart and Target, also got to mention Amazon as well here, as I'll just make this a market weight-- we call them out real quick. They're down by about 2/10 of a percent right now.And we mentioned some of the hiring that's been taking place. Of course, we knew Target was going to hire up to 100,000 holiday workers. We know that Walmart was going to hire 40,000. Now, Amazon announcing today that they're going to hire 150,000 workers for the holiday season, along with a pay of about $19 an hour.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Target The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TargetOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Harrison, for US$453k worth of shares, at about US$218 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$156. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Target insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Target better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Target Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Target. Specifically, Chief Accounting Officer Matthew Liegel ditched US$213k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Target Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$170m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Target Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Target.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Target Corp. TGT, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Walmart Inc. WMT and Macy's, Inc. MHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Can Retailers Bounce Back on Holiday Season Shopping Spree?Soaring commodity prices have made people spend cautiously, which has been impacting the retail sector. Sales have been slowing and that is worrying retailers. However, even then, they are banking heavily on the upcoming holiday season, which like every year, is expected to boost retail sales.Retailers are thus leaving no stone unturned to make the most of the holiday season. Although the sector is faced with several challenges, including soaring commodity prices, retailers are trying their best to ramp up sales during this period. Several retailers this year plan to launch early holiday deals, while others are on a hiring spree to meet the surge in demand during that period.Aggressive HiringThe retail sector has been struggling with sales slowing month over month for quite some time. However, a modest but 0.4% jump in retail sales in August ahead of the holiday season is a good sign for the worried retailers. Although rising prices have been impacting retail sales over the past few months, the sector has still managed to fight back as higher demand for goods has been driving sales.Besides, the industry is facing several other challenges. Supply-chain crisis and higher freight charges are also hindering smooth sales. However, retailers are hopeful for a great holiday season.Holiday season sales account for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers and are one of the most important sales windows. And this holiday season might not be as bad for the retail sector as was initially anticipated. The annual holiday retail estimate from Deloitte predicts a 4-6% increase in retail sales.Story continuesSpending will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion between November and January. Sales during the holiday season last year totaled $1.49 trillion, a 15.1% increase from 2020. Given that everyone is wary about spending this year, the prediction is quite low, but the good thing is that even then, sales are expected to rise quite significantly.This has made retailers optimistic, and they are once again going on a hiring spree. Retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. and Target Corp. will be launching early holiday deals, which will begin in October.Target Corporation plans to hire 10,000 seasonal workers ahead of the holiday season to meet customers' demands during that period. TGT is also back with its 'Target Deals Day' with the aim of luring more customers to buy essentials and must-have products. This time, Target Corporation will start the 'Target Deals Day' on Oct 6, which will continue till Oct 8.Moreover, for those who look for the best deals, TGT is coming up with ""Holiday Price Match Guarantee."" The offer will start on Oct 6 and continue through Dec 24. Target Corporation carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. too is aggressively hiring workers for the upcoming holiday season. DKS plans to hire at least 9,000 heads ahead of the holiday season. DICK's Sporting Goods has been doing well despite the sector facing several challenges because of its both strong online and offline presence. Given that a lot of people plan to travel this year, DKS expects sales of its athletic wear to grow during the holiday season.Walmart Inc. has always been a major player during the holiday season. This time it's going to be no different. WMT will be hiring 40,000 workers ahead of the holiday season. Walmart intends to fill in a wide range of positions, from temporary store clerks to full-time, permanent truck drivers. For the holiday season, Walmart will offer more hours to its existing employees.Walmart also unveiled updated return policies and windows, including a return pickup from home option for Walmart+ members for the holiday season.Macy's, Inc. is also keeping pace with other major retailers and is planning to hire thousands of workers for the holiday season. Last week, M said that it was looking to hire more than 41,000 seasonal full- and part-time employees for its Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury stores, as well as call centers and supply-chain locations.Macy said that it will start its pay at $15 per hour, with flexible scheduling options that may include voluntary overtime. Employees will receive discounts, and some programs may allow them to make extra money. M also said that most job offers are made within 48 hours and provide information on online and in-person hiring events, bloomingdalesJOBS.com, and bluemercury.com.

PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc. price | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteThe approval for a single-port robotic surgical system will enable Japanese surgeons for a minimally invasive experience for complex procedures.

The Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, to which Analog Devices belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Analog Devices is expected to post earnings of $2.58 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.42 points to a change of +45.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.52 indicates a change of +1% from what Analog Devices is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Analog Devices is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Analog Devices, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +35.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.93 billion and $12.31 billion estimates indicate +63% and +3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAnalog Devices reported revenues of $3.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.8%. EPS of $2.52 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.71%. The EPS surprise was +3.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Analog Devices is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Analog Devices. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.03%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.Heading into today, shares of the global payments processor had lost 6.36% over the past month, lagging the Business Services sector's loss of 5.4% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.51% in that time.Visa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $1.87 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 15.43%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.57 billion, up 15.48% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.2% lower within the past month. Visa is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Visa is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.43. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.65, so we one might conclude that Visa is trading at a premium comparatively.Meanwhile, V's PEG ratio is currently 1.35. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial Transaction Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.05 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector.

250,aaa257bf-dea1-3df7-a0d6-3ecc7fc2230b,V,2022-10-07,New Visa Reports Underscore Importance of Cybersecurity Amid Shifting Threats,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-reports-underscore-importance-cybersecurity-153400942.html,1665070440,STORY,"['V', 'TGT']","[Whether in-person or online, cybercriminals target payments touchpoints with sophisticated fraud techniquesSAN FRANCISCO, October 06, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the world leader in digital payments, today shared an updated look at how fraud has evolved since the height of the pandemic, with criminals simultaneously targeting online and offline vulnerabilities as our daily lives return to a blend of in-person and e-commerce experiences.""As in-person commerce returns to pre-pandemic levels, crooks are back to exploiting the physical points of vulnerability in stores, while continuing to capitalize on e-commerce through malware, ransomware and phishing attacks, among others,"" said Paul D. Fabara, Chief Risk Officer at Visa. ""In fact, we are continuing to see high rates of skimming, growing over the already elevated levels of the winter of 2021, where fraudsters are jumping on the rise of in-person activity.""Two new pieces of research – the latest Visa Biannual Threats Report and an MIT Technology Review Insights study ""Moving Money in a Digital World,"" released today in partnership with Visa – highlight new and returning threats to the post-pandemic economy.While fraud early on during the COVID-19 pandemic was concentrated on online scams, in-person attacks are now trending higher as criminals widen their scope to once again capture physical targets. The past year experienced an increase in card-present threats such as physical skimming on ATM and point-of-sale terminals – a trend that will likely persist. For instance, from June – November 2021, Visa saw a 176% increase in physical skimming devices over the previous 12-month period1.Digital commerce, crypto users are rich targets for innovative fraudstersStill, the digital commerce environment – vastly accelerated by the pandemic – remains the richest target for cybercriminals.Nearly three-fourths of fraud and data breach cases investigated by Visa’s Global Risk team involved e-commerce merchants – often social engineering and ransomware attacks. Digital skimming attacks targeting e-commerce platforms and third-party code integrations are common.Story continuesThese attacks shine a light on the need for stringent security controls on merchant websites and checkout pages, ensuring external code is not enabled in sensitive cardholder environments. In fact, 42% of respondents in the MIT Technology Review Insights report say security measures are important for their customers, with 59% acknowledging that cybersecurity threats are the biggest challenge to expanding digital payments. Many are prioritizing advanced security capabilities like digital tokens (32%), artificial intelligence and enhanced authorization (43%).Beyond attacks on traditional currency, threat actors are employing new tactics to defraud cryptocurrency users, including new malware focused on browser extension wallets for crypto users as well as innovation in phishing and social engineering schemes. Crypto bridge services are also a target. From January through February 2022, three sizeable thefts exploiting vulnerabilities in various bridge services netted cyber thieves over $400 million.2Protection Is Visa’s promiseWhile cybercrime persists, Visa has increased its efforts to mitigate fraud. Over the past five years, Visa has invested more than $9 billion on network security. Visa employs more than a thousand dedicated specialists protecting Visa’s network from malware, zero-day attacks and insider threats 24x7x365. Visa also deploys AI-enabled capabilities and always-on experts to protect its ecosystem, proactively detecting and preventing billions of dollars of attempted fraud. In fact, Visa’s real-time monitoring with AI blocked over $4.2 billion in fraudulent payments volume in the last 12 months, preventing many from ever knowing they were at risk of a potential fraudulent transaction.To read more of the Payment Fraud Disruption report, visit Biannual Threats Report (visa.com).

Inflation remains high, interest rates keep climbing, as does the risk of a recession. Yet while overall market sentiment remains deeply negative, there is opportunity to seize, with cheap large-cap stocks to buy.Not only has it been speculative and growth-focused stocks that have hit lower prices following the latest rounds of market volatility. Even more defensive names, as well as stocks benefiting from current trends (commodities stocks) have been been bid down to lower prices.This has created the ability to scoop up many high-quality large-cap stocks at very favorable valuations. Made cheaper by external factors, once these issues clear up, these undervalued but fundamentally superior stocks are well-positioned to make a rapid recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s the story here, with these seven large-cap stocks to buy. Earning either an A or B in Portfolio Grader, consider now a great time to enter/add to a position.AMXAmerica Movil SAB de CV$16.86CNQCanadian Natural Resources$49.63MOSMosaic Company$49.20MROMarathon Oil$24.61PBRPetroleo Brasileiro S.A.$13.76SUSuncor Energy$30.34TSTenaris S.A.$27.82America Movil SAB de CV (AMX)A digital illustration of the telecom industry.Source: ShutterstockMexico-based America Movil SAB de CV (NYSE:AMX) is the dominant telecom firm in its home market. It has a 70% and 62% share of the Mexican mobile internet and mobile phone markets, respectively. America Movil also has a substantial presence in Europe, Latin America and the U.S.Holding steady compared to the overall market earlier this year, AMX stock has pulled back in recent months. The aforementioned macro concerns have led investors to shun America Movil shares. However, instead of going with the crowd, you may want to instead take the contrarian view on this stock, which earns a B in Portfolio Grader.Story continuesAs Citi analyst Andres Cardona argued when he upgraded the stock in August, the company’s strong free cash flow points to increased dividends and buybacks. These could help move the AMX stock back higher. A spinoff of its mobile towers business is another potential catalyst.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWith energy prices currently moving lower, the sell-off among oil and gas stocks such as Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) may seem justified. Yet while crude oil prices have fallen back to levels last seen just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (which caused a fossil fuel supply shock), that doesn’t mean the opportunity here with CNQ has come and gone.First, it’s not a given that fossil fuel prices will continue to pull back. In fact, some commodities analysts, including the chief economist of oil trading giant Trafigura, believe that another spike lies ahead next year, due to new supply shocks created by industry underinvestment.Second, as demand could continue to outstrip supply, this energy company is likely to continue using the high profits resulting from high oil and gas prices to pay down debt, buy back stock and issue special dividends.CNQ stock earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Mosaic Company (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith investors declaring the Russia/Ukraine-driven spike in fertilizer prices as temporary, Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) shares have fallen considerably in the past few months.The market currently is pricing this provider of fertilizer ingredients like phosphates and potash as if its recent windfall earnings are going to reverse.But taking a look at the details, so far fertilizer prices have stayed high. While something that would have worsened the supply crisis (destruction of a key fertilizer facility by Hurricane Ian) fortunately did not happen, the key factor keeping supplies tight (sanctions against Russia) continues. This points to prices remaining high, which of course is good news for Mosaic.MOS stock (which earns a B in Portfolio Grader) currently trades for 3.6 times earnings. If the company continues to report similar results, the stock could get out of its current slump, and resume an upwards trajectory.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another situation where the market is overestimating how much the latest energy price trends will affect future results and underappreciating the company’s ability to deliver strong returns to its shareholders.MRO stock trades for only 4.8 times 2022 estimated earnings. Even if Marathon’s earnings per share (or EPS) falls from $4.93 to $4.33 next year (per sell-side forecasts), Marathon still trades at a low valuation (5.4 times earnings).Beyond just the potential for shares to rise on multiple expansion, what could really move the needle for Marathon Oil stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) is management’s decision to return a majority of its cash flow back to investors.Since last October, Marathon has bought back over $2.3 billion worth of shares. While its current dividend (1.36% forward yield) is modest, there’s substantial room for dividend growth.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR)the Petroleo Brasileiro logo on a building during daylightSource: A.PAES / Shutterstock.comBetter known as Petrobras, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE:PBR) is Brazil’s biggest oil company. Recently, this large-cap energy stock has been under pressure and not just because of the pullback in crude oil prices.Brazil’s 2022 Presidential election has also weighed on PBR stock. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who won a plurality of votes in the first round on Oct. 2, has a strong chance of winning the Oct. 30 run-off election. The left-wing candidate’s plans for Petrobras could come at the expense of PBR’s minority shareholders.However, as one sell-side analyst (J.P. Morgan’s Rodolfo Angele) has argued, it’s possible that the prospect of a da Silva victory is already priced-in. I agree with this view, given PBR stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) trades for only 3 times 2022 earnings. If uncertainties about Petrobras’ future resolve, shares could experience an outsized rebound.Suncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy (NYSE:SU) is another of the cheap large-cap stocks to buy in the energy sector. As with the two other energy stocks listed above, Suncor has been pushed to an extremely-discounted valuation.SU stock currently trades for just four times 2022 estimated earnings. Besides the potential for a re-rating, if oil prices remain high, there’s another catalyst in motion. Back in July, Suncor added three directors to its board backed by activist fund Elliott Investment Management.Furthermore, Suncor said it was open to Elliott’s idea of selling its retail gas station chain, Petro-Canada. A sale of Petro-Canada, along with other ideas Elliott has suggested (like enhanced capital return) could enable this stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) to move towards prices more reflective of Suncor’s underlying value. Along with two catalysts to move it higher, SU stock also sports a 5% forward dividend yield.Tenaris S.A. (TS)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockTenaris S.A. (NYSE:TS) is a producer of steel products for the oil and gas industry with operations throughout the world. Tenaris rallied earlier this year, alongside other energy-related stocks on the heels of Russia’s Ukraine invasion.Since then, TS stock has given back these gains, as Russia-related tailwinds have become outweighed by concerns about a global recession. However, the current bearish sentiment for shares works to your advantage.Trading at a low valuation (7.7 times earnings), and sporting a 4.33% forward yield, TS stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) could deliver strong returns for investors buying it today.As Tenaris argued in its Sept. 30. investor presentation,  as demand for fossil fuels will keep rising, even with the shift towards renewable energy, long-term trends remain on the company’s side. This points to continued growth for Tenaris, and a continued move higher for TS stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in CNQ, MRO, PBR, SU and TS.

Both phones take full advantage of 5G Ultra Wideband so you can download and stream movies and TV shows in minutes, video conference and collaborate remotely in near real-time and take advantage of new immersive experiences8. This is yet another example of Verizon’s focus to accelerate 5G mobility growth with cutting-edge new smartphones. Here are the coolest Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro features.Performance that adapts to you: At A Glance lets you see important information and shortcuts right on your home screen to save you time based on context — like when your next business appointment is. Pixel searches your commonly used apps, like Gmail, to find hotel reservations, food delivery ETA and video doorbell notifications from Nest and Ring.Speech recognition is also getting a big boost in the new Pixel phones. Now you have access to additional languages in Live Translate, and instant voice replies from your lock screen with Assistant Voice Typing.Even the battery adjusts to your needs. Pixel's Adaptive Battery can last over 24 hours by prioritizing power to the apps you use the most9.Photography that unleashes true self-expression: Pixel continues to prove that a great camera is more than just hardware and megapixels. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro include new features that turn your snapshots into art with zero learning curve.Want to get rid of that telephone line in the background of a portrait or that exit sign from your wedding photos? Magic Eraser in Google Photos makes distractions disappear, or you can use it to camouflage objects to put the focus on your subject.Zoom to your heart's desire and get crisp photos. Pixel 7 Pro has the highest quality zoom on a Pixel, ever. Pixel 7 Pro’s Super Res Zoom camera provides image quality comparable to a 10x optical zoom — so you can see the subject at its sharpest — as if you were right up close. On Pixel 7, Super Res Zoom now provides up to 2x optical zoom equivalent results without the need of any extra Telephoto lens10. For video fans, Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are now able to create high-quality videos with a beautiful out-of-focus background and colors — called Cinematic Blur — that draw attention to the subject of interest. And with 10-bit HDR, you can record videos with vibrant contrast so you can document epic landscapes and cinematic moments with hyper-realistic quality.Security, privacy and peace of mind: Keep your business and personal information safe with the new Pixel 7 series thanks to multiple layers of hardware security. Under the hood, Tensor G2 has the Google Security Anchor built in, and it works with the certified, next-gen Titan M2 security chip, which makes Pixel even more resilient to attacks11.Security risks are constantly evolving. To protect you and your sensitive data against these threats, Pixel comes with at least five years of security updates. With these updates, your Pixel gets even more secure over time.Whether you run IT for an Enterprise or manage a small business, the Pixel 7 series gives you the peace of mind, battery life and Google innovations you need for powerful, all-day productivity. And later this year, Pixel 7 will offer a free built-in VPN, enabled by Google One, so you have extra protection wherever you’re connected and no matter what app or browser you’re using.Google Pixel Watch — Help by Google.

""The advantages of these products are being recognized by younger generations and we remain committed to providing these best-in-class products that benefit our environment.""While a sizeable portion of Americans still use all gas-powered equipment or a combination of both gas and electric, the appeal of improved battery life, the lower cost of switching to electric, and increased performance resonate the most to homeowners, according to the survey.Leading the ChargeBy leveraging battery technology from its iconic tools business, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is leading the charge in electrification.

Finance Live"" this morning, everyone. We're taking a look at the US major averages. We are mixed right now with the Dow just barely in negative territory here. And so we did open the day lower. Now, we're seeing a little green on the screen there. For more, let's get on over to Yahoo! Finance's own Jared Blikre. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, let's take a look at the four-day price action here. Dow just passed into the green yet again. This is a one day. And so let's take a look at Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, right up against the upper end of this range that we've been looking at. Good for 6%. Very impressive start to the quarter. A day ago, it was the best start to a quarter since 1938. Have to retabulate that at the end of today. So far so good.A lot of seasonality studies out there. This is a midterm election year. And a lot of times we do see a rise in October. I've spoken to a number of commentators, analysts, strategists, and they do expect largely a big bounce sometime between now and mid-November. But the debate centers around, is it going to be reflecting the low or is that just going to lead to yet another low? Jury's open on that one.So we have energy, tech, communication services, and consumer discretionary all in the green outperforming. So that means the mega caps, plus energy, are feeling the love right now.And let's take a look at the NASDAQ 100. You can see mainly green here. Nvidia up over 2 and 1/2 percent. Alphabet up over 1%. Not a lot of outliers that I'm seeing. Looks like software and also semiconductors is feeling some love. AMD up about 3% there.Let's take a look at the Dow. And we can see more of a mixed board. We can see pharmaceuticals taking a little bit of a backseat here. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck off by about 2/3 of percent. And just taking a look at our leaders for today. We can see a lot of love for ARKK, as well as Korean stocks, chip makers, IPOs, retail.Story continuesLet me just show you what's happened so far this week. This is gonna be the four-day price action. And we can see a ton of outperformance by stocks. Those are the chip stocks, once again.Meme stocks, and let's take a look at that as well. We can see the four-day price action on this. Very indicative of a risk on, let's-buy-everything mood. And we know these don't necessarily last, but that's what we're seeing right now. So a little bit of enthusiasm as we still approach this liftoff from those lows.BRIAN SOZZI: Gosh, love that heat-map analysis. Jared Blikre, thanks so much. Appreciate it.]"

272,18fa1ed7-3c35-32de-b75a-11a978f33cc9,MCK,2022-10-07,Here's Why You Should Retain Chemed (CHE) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-chemed-che-164904328.html,1665074944,STORY,"['CHE', '^GSPC', 'AMN', 'SWAV', 'MCK']","[Chemed Corporation CHE is gaining from continued strength in the Roto-Rooter segment. The company’s earnings for the second quarter of 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The improvement in assisted living facility admissions buoys optimism. A favorable solvency position is encouraging too. However, the continued sales decline in the VITAS arm and pandemic-led disruptions do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 4.3% against a 29.7% fall of the industry and a 14.2% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned hospice care provider has a market capitalization of $6.66 billion. Its earnings surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.3%.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 24.5% compared with the industry’s 13.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4% increase. The company projects 7.1% growth for the next five years compared with the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s projected growth rate of 11.4% and 11.4%, respectively.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayImpressive Q2 Results: Chemed ended the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings. The year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share appears promising. Robust performance by the Roto-Rooter segment drove the top line. Chemed’s nursing home admissions in the second quarter rose 5.3%. Assisted living facility admissions increased 5.6% and home-based pre-admit admissions moved up 0.2% on a year-over-year basis. The expansion of gross and operating margins adds to the upsides.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoto-Rooter Continues to Expand: We are encouraged by Chemed’s Roto-Rooter segment, which delivered revenue growth of 6% year over year in the second quarter. The business witnessed continued demand for plumbing, drain cleaning services and water restoration services in the quarter under review. Total Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenues rose 7.5%. Total Roto-Rooter branch residential revenues registered growth of 5% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesManagement at Chemed anticipates the continued expansion of Roto-Rooter’s market share, banking on the company’s core competitive advantages in terms of brand awareness, customer response time, and 24/7 call centers and Internet presence.Strong Solvency: Chemed exited the second quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 million. Long-term debt at the end of the second quarter was $111.8 million, much higher than the current-cash level. While exiting the quarter, the company reported short-term payable debt of $5 million. This is good news regarding Chemed’s solvency position, as the company holds sufficient cash for short-term debt repayment during the economic downturn.DownsidesVITAS Results Discouraging: Chemed’s VITAS revenues registered a 4.5% year-over-year decline in the second quarter. The segment continued to be challenged by pandemic-related issues, including health care labor shortages, disruption in senior housing occupancy and related hospice referrals. VITAS admissions were down 12.5% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter under review.Pandemic-Related Challenges: The pandemic continues to impact senior housing occupancy, leading to a corresponding reduction in VITAS nursing home admissions. Evidently, nursing home patients accounted for 16.4% of VITAS’ second-quarter patient census compared to 18% of the total census just prior to the pandemic. Further, pandemic-led staffing challenges continue to impact the Roto-Rooter arm.Tough Competitive Landscape: The market for sewer, drain and pipe cleaning and plumbing repair businesses is highly competitive, with the presence of several local and regional firms. Besides, as the hospice care industry is highly fragmented, VITAS competes with a large number of organizations on the basis of its ability to deliver quality, responsive services.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chemed’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $19.46, indicating an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.14 billion, suggesting a 0.3% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK. While ShockWave Medical and AMN Healthcare Services sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), McKesson carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Estimates for ShockWave Medical’s earnings per share rose from $2.02 to $2.57 for 2022 and from $2.95 to $3.42 for 2023 in the past 60 days. SWAV has gained 53.4% so far this year.ShockWave Medical delivered an earnings surprise of 180.14%, on average, in the last four quarters.Estimates for AMN Healthcare Services have improved from earnings of $10.41 to $11.26 for 2022 and $7.94 to $8.30 for 2023 in the past 60 days. AMN stock has declined 13.5% so far this year.AMN Healthcare Services delivered an earnings surprise of 15.66%, on average, in the last four quarters.McKesson’s earnings per share estimates increased from $23.27 to $24.42 for fiscal 2023 and $25.41 to $26.04 for fiscal 2024 in the past 60 days.

This, in turn, has enabled NARI to quickly innovate and improve its products while informing its clinical and educational programs.Inari Medical completed enrollment in its CLOUT deep vein thrombosis (DVT) registry earlier this year. Both safety and efficacy results were excellent in the earlier data cuts and the company anticipates seeing similar encouraging results when the full patient cohort of CLOUT is presented later in 2022. The company is also conducting a PEERLESS randomized controlled trial in pulmonary embolism (PE) patients. Last month, the company announced favorable outcomes of the fully enrolled 800-patient FLASH registry in PE. The primary endpoint of the registry was successfully met by FlowTriever for the treatment of PE.Story continuesInari Medical stated that a significant percentage of DVT and PE patients are treated with conservative medical management that involves anticoagulants alone, which do not break down or remove an existing clot. Consequently, the company believes that there is a huge untapped demand for safe and effective treatment and removal of the existing clot in patients with these diseases.The company received FDA clearance for Artix in March. This product is a peripheral thrombectomy device developed to cater to unmet needs in a new patient population. It is the first component of a broader toolbox that the company is in the process of developing. Last year, the company completed its limited market release on ClotTriever Bold and moved to full-market release. Bold is a more aggressive version of the company’s original ClotTriever device.What’s Weighing on the Company?Most of Inari Medical’s product sales and revenues come from a limited number of hospitals. The company’s growth and profitability mainly depend on its ability to boost physician and patient awareness of its products and how keen physicians and hospitals are to adopt its products and perform catheter-based thrombectomy procedures for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE).The company’s inability to show the benefits of its products and catheter-based thrombectomy procedures will lead to limited adoption of the same. It might not happen as quickly as expected, negatively impacting its business and financial condition.Estimates TrendFor 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $368 million, indicating an improvement of 32.9% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The same for the bottom line stands at a loss of 67 cents per share. It had reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 18 cents in the year-ago quarter.Inari Medical, Inc. PriceInari Medical, Inc.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the past year, shares of SmileDirectClub have underperformed the broader industry. The stock has declined 84.4% compared with the industry’s 13.6% fall. SmileDirectClub exited the second quarter of 2022 with lower-than-expected earnings. The company registered a year-over-year decline in revenues in the quarter due to lower unique aligner shipments. The company also witnessed a drop in both net and financing revenues on a year-over-year basis.Throughout the second quarter, the macroeconomic challenges continued to impact SmileDirectClub’s core demographic and business spending. According to the company, challenges to consumer spending accelerated faster than anticipated during the quarter. These, combined with reduced stimulus, sustained high inflation and a shift in discretionary spending toward services, will result in less predictable demand curves and lower overall expected demand in the balance of the year. Accordingly, SmileDirectClub reduced its 2022 guidance.The contraction of gross margin does not bode well. Escalating operating costs are building pressure on the bottom line. SmileDirectClub’s second-quarter marketing and selling expenses contracted 25.7%. General and administrative expenses were down 14.9% year over year. The company incurred an adjusted operating loss of $51.8 million in the quarter, marginally narrower than the year-ago adjusted operating loss of $52.7 million.SmileDirectClub, Inc. PriceSmileDirectClub, Inc. PriceSmileDirectClub, Inc. price | SmileDirectClub, Inc. QuoteA huge debt balance as well as a tough competitive landscape remains an overhang.On a positive note, SmileDirectClub’s second-quarter average aligner gross sales price (ASP) was 1917, marking an increase of $27 from the first quarter. This was primarily driven by a price increase implemented in the United States in May and in the United Kingdom in late June. According to the company, additional geographies are targeted for increases during the second half of 2022.Story continuesImplicit price concessions, as a percentage of gross aligner revenues, are expected to trend back toward the company’s historical levels between 9% and 10%. Meanwhile, SmileDirectClub plans to hold its Investor Day at its manufacturing facility in Nashville at the end of the year or the first quarter of 2023.SmileDirectClub is currently focused on developing products to further differentiate its offerings in the oral care industry. In May 2022, the company announced the expansion of its best-in-class oral care product offerings with its new Wireless Premium Teeth Whitening Kit. In February 2022, it expanded its award-winning oral care product offerings with the new Stain Barrier. The latest whitening innovation from SmileDirectClub, Stain Barrier, protects teeth with an invisible shield against common staining beverages, including coffee, tea, red wine and soda.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK.

The Japanese regulatory authority has cleared the da Vinci SP surgical system for use in different surgeries like general surgeries, thoracic surgeries (excluding cardiac procedures and intercostal approaches), urologic surgeries, gynecological surgeries, and transoral head and neck surgeries.Intuitive Surgical is planning to launch the new single-port robotic surgical system in Japan soon. The company stated that da Vinci SP can also be used in Korea for urologic surgery, general laparoscopic surgery, gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, general thoracoscopic surgery, and otolaryngologic surgery performed via an oral approach.The da Vinci SP system is already approved and available in the United States for urology and transoral otolaryngology procedures.Intuitive Surgical’s robotic surgical system is already available in Japan for more than a decade.

The robotic surgery system enables flexible port placement and excellent internal and external range of motion through the single SP arm. Surgeons control the fully articulating instruments and the camera on the da Vinci SP system from a surgeon console.The da Vinci SP is part of Intuitive’s fourth generation of products, which also includes the da Vinci X and Xi multiport systems, offering more options to its customers.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces risks associated with open surgery.

MCK and Humana HUM.3 Top-Ranked Healthcare Stocks Thriving in 2022With volatility rocking the market back and forth in 2022, it goes without saying that investors could benefit from injecting an additional layer of defense into their portfolios.After all, defense wins ballgames.When thinking of stocks with a defensive nature, healthcare comes to the front of many minds.But why?Healthcare companies can generate revenue in the face of any economic environment thanks to their services being in constant demand.For those looking to level up their portfolio's defense, three top-ranked healthcare stocks – Molina Healthcare, McKesson Corp. and Humana – should all be considered.The chart below illustrates the share performance of all three companies year-to-date with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.As we can see, all three have widely outperformed the general market in 2022, telling us that market participants have defended them all year long. Let's take a closer look at each one.McKesson Corp. McKesson Corp. is a healthcare services and information technology company operating through two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions.MCK's near-term earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months, pushing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Further, McKesson looks to continue its growth trajectory; for its current fiscal year (FY23), earnings are forecasted to climb by 3%.And in FY24, bottom line estimates call for an additional 6.6% of growth.MCK's top line is also in exceptional health – revenue estimates suggest Y/Y growth of 5% and 4.3% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.McKesson shares could also be seen as undervalued, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value. The company's 14.5X forward earnings multiple is above its five-year median but represents a sizable 31% discount relative to its Zacks Medical Sector.Story continuesMolina HealthcareMolina Healthcare is a multi-state managed care organization participating exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. MOH sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Analysts have raised their bottom-line outlook across nearly all timeframes over the last several months.Molina Healthcare's growth trajectory is impossible to ignore – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $17.65 for its current fiscal year (FY22) pencils in a stellar double-digit 31% Y/Y uptick. For FY23, estimates are calling for an additional 13.5% of growth.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue increases of 12.5% and 6.3% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Further, Molina Healthcare has an impressive earnings track record, exceeding revenue and earnings estimates in each of its last four quarters. Just in its latest print, the company registered a 4.8% EPS beat paired with a 6.2% revenue beat.Humana Humana is a health care plan provider in the United States, providing health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization, Private Fee-For-Service, and Preferred Provider Organization plans. HUM sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Over the last few months, analysts have had a bullish stance on the company's bottom line outlook while also being in full agreement.HUM shares trade at a 20.2X forward earnings multiple, just a tick above their 19.7X five-year median and representing a slight 5% discount relative to their Zacks Medical Sector average.Humana boasts a Style Score of an A for Value.Like MOH and MCK, Humana carries a rock-solid growth profile; earnings are forecasted to grow by 21% in FY22 and a further double-digit 12% in FY23.Humana's top line estimates are also inspiring – the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $93 billion for FY22 suggests revenue growth of nearly 12% compared to FY21 sales of $83.1 billion. In FY23, estimates call for a further 9% of revenue growth.Bottom LineWhile price action in 2022 has been overwhelmingly negative, some areas, such as healthcare stocks, are putting their defensive nature on full display.Consumers have a never-ending need for the services these companies provide, helping explain why these stocks are generally seen as a safer place to park cash. All three stocks above operate in the healthcare realm, have betas of less than 1.0, and have inspiring growth profiles.To put the cherry on top, all three carry a favorable Zacks Rank.All three deserve a watchlist spot for those looking to deploy a heavier defensive approach.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The commercial operation of this facility is targeted to begin in 2026-2027.In support of this Air Products' project, in July 2022, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) board approved 94 MW of low-cost St. Lawrence hydroelectric power to Air Products for its significant investment and the creation of 90 jobs in New York State. This project supports New York State's goal of becoming a Regional Clean Energy Hydrogen Hub, as announced by Governor Kathy Hochul in March 2022. New York's hydrogen hub ambitions directly support the goals of the State's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.Air Products has determined that the market demand warrants the investment in the project, assuming the receipt of certain local and state incentives, as well as any benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and which are anticipated in the current project budget.Further to this proposed facility announcement, Air Products is also investigating the feasibility of establishing a hydrogen fueling station network in the United States' northeast region, including the ability to serve Air Products' truck fleet. Air Products has announced plans to convert its global fleet of approximately 2,000 trucks to hydrogen fuel cell zero-emission vehicles.""We are very pleased to announce this proposed project as this shows our commitment to work closely with New York State to support its energy transition program by making real investments and creating highly paid jobs with our Massena green hydrogen project. This project is another demonstration of our leadership role in the low-carbon hydrogen and the hydrogen for mobility markets, and New York State's and IRA incentives will continue to encourage hydrogen's key role and our investment in the energy transition,"" said Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Seifi Ghasemi.Story continuesNYPA Interim President and CEO, Justin E. Driscoll, said, ""In supporting Air Products' expansion in Massena, NYPA is furthering New York's aggressive climate goals and helping to advance the state's vision of becoming a regional hydrogen hub. The St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project is a critical economic development catalyst in the region — and around the state — and we are pleased to leverage its clean hydropower to strengthen the North Country's economy.""The low-carbon intensity liquid hydrogen product from the facility is expected to be sold to the mobility market in New York State as well as other potential northeast industrial markets.  If all the hydrogen is used for the heavy-duty truck market, future climate benefits over the project's lifetime would include avoiding more than six million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is equivalent to the emissions from over 600 million gallons of diesel used in heavy-duty trucks.  Demand for green hydrogen for mobility and industrial applications is expected to grow significantly in the northeast as a result of the New York-led multi-state agreement to develop a proposal to become one of the regional clean hydrogen hubs designated through the federal Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program, and New York State's adoption of a new Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) rule. New York State's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act targets include: 40 percent greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions below 1990 levels by 2030, a carbon free electricity system by 2040, and an 85 percent reduction in GHGs below 1990 levels by 2050.About Air Products  Air Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years. Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, the Company provides essential industrial gases, related equipment and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemical, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage.

Robinson CHRW, Ford Motor Co. F and DISH Network Corp. DISH.5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Watch Despite Market MayhemMounting inflation in the United States is a key concern, implying that market volatility is still rampant. To tame the red-hot inflation, the Fed has hiked interest rates 300 basis points so far this year.  The central bank further vowed to raise interest rates to drag down inflation to its 2% target at best by 2025. Soaring interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will persistently affect consumer spending. In fact, the Fed also warned of economic hardship going forward.Rising energy and food prices apart, supply-chain disruptions and the resultant supply-demand imbalance are aggravating the stock market volatility. This uncertainty caused the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — to shed 8.8%, 9.3% and 10.5% of their value, respectively, in September.However, this gloomy scenario does not mean that investors should dodge stocks. In fact, broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines, CVR Energy, C.H. Robinson, Ford Motor Co. and DISH Network Corp. are worth keeping on one's radar for healthy returns despite this market bloodbath.Why Broker Advice is the Need of the HourBrokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), embark on thorough research of the stocks under their coverage. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers indulge in extensive research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise.Therefore, the brokers' opinion can be a valuable guide for investors. Thus, adhering to brokers' well-researched information is of paramount importance, particularly in uncertain times such as the present scenario. This is because it is next to impossible for individual investors to keep track of the market nuances amid such economic upheavals and design a winning basket of stocks.Story continuesOne of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns, irrespective of the market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and raise estimates. Naturally, adding such stocks to one's portfolio amid an unpredictable situation might prove to be a winning strategy.To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving broker recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Do Not Ignore the Top LineHowever, designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to lead to a winning approach. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL.

Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, operates as an asset-light logistics player.

Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock.C.H. Robinson has an encouraging earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). CHRW has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 2.09% upward over the past 60 days.Ford's vehicle line-up, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport and Edge is impressive.

To address top-line concerns, we included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75(This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10(This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter).We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10(The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio).Price greater than 5(as a stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors).Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days(Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded).Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000(This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization).Com/ADR/Canadian= Com(This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks).Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX.

PLANET 2050 also includes the aspiration to power customer success exclusively with carbon neutral technologies by the year 2050.Destination Zero, developed in 2021, is the company's approach to decarbonizing Cummins' products and achieving that aspiration. It calls for advancing no-carbon technologies such as battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cells for customers who are ready, while reducing the carbon produced by Cummins' core platforms such as internal combustion engines.The company, for example, is bringing to market internal combustion engines fueled by hydrogen, as well as fuel agnostic engines offering the benefits of a common-base architecture that can be optimized for a particular low- or no-carbon fuel.Story continuesRumsey, who was named CEO in July, described PLANET 2050 as the umbrella covering not only Destination Zero but a third initiative - Cummins Water Works, the company's global strategic program to strengthen communities through sustainable water and addressing the global water crisis.Launched in July 2021, the initiative partners with leading water experts to develop and invest in sustainable, large scale, high-impact water projects. Cummins Water Works aims to bring fresh water to 20 million people who would otherwise not have it. The effort already has projects underway in six countries - Brazil, Chile, India, Mexico, South Africa and the United States.The challenging goals and aspirations in PLANET 2050 cannot be achieved without strong support and engagement from Cummins employees, Rumsey said. She urged employees to join the PLANET 2050 Influencer Program, an effort to create employee advocates for PLANET 2050.""All of us are part of shaping this,"" Rumsey said of the company's environmental strategy. ""…Our success comes from all of you, your innovative ideas, your creativity, your problem solving.

More than 14,000 people have completed one of the company’s workforce development and job training programs since 2019.CHICAGO, October 06, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelon (Nasdaq: EXC) has signed the White House Talent Pipeline Challenge. The challenge is a nationwide call to action for employers, education and training providers, state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments and philanthropic organizations to make tangible commitments that support equitable workforce development in the critical infrastructure sectors of broadband, construction and electrification.The pledge is the latest effort by Exelon to build on its industry-leading workforce development programs. These programs have for many years contributed to economic growth in underserved communities and launched rewarding careers for people who face systemic barriers that keep opportunity out of reach. This year, Exelon is on track to invest nearly $14 million to support more than 75 different workforce development programs across the company’s six utilities, reaching more than 5,000 participants.Exelon’s workforce development program strategy is built on four pillars: STEM awareness and education, barrier reduction/elimination, opportunity creation and partnerships, and thought leadership.""As the largest energy utility company in the United States, Exelon has a responsibility to be a leading driver of family-sustaining career opportunities that are accessible to people in underserved and under-resourced communities,"" said Robert Matthews, Exelon chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion officer. ""Bringing our resources to bear in this effort is both a business and moral imperative for Exelon. We commend the Biden-Harris administration for challenging us to do more, and for signaling a national commitment to leveraging the power of partnerships in proven strategies for sustainable, equitable economic growth.""Story continuesCommitments by Exelon and other Talent Pipeline Challenge organizations will complement the Federal government’s investment in workforce development. In addition, challenge commitments will help ensure there are trained workers who are ready to meet the demands of implementing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These workers will play a vital role in the country’s transition from ""a historic economic recovery to stable and steady growth that works for working people,"" White House officials said in their challenge announcement.A stronger talent pipeline starts with stronger partnerships. The challenge encourages employers to partner with and hire skilled workers from at least one training provider in each region in which the employer has operations. The White House said training partnerships will build on pathways to quality jobs for women, people of color and underserved workers—including those from rural and Tribal communities and communities with persistent poverty.""Exelon is a leader in workforce development and an invaluable thought partner to Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) as we work to encourage more organizations to think equitably about building the energy workforce of the future,"" said Missy Henriksen, executive director of CEWD. ""We’re grateful to see them continue to demonstrate their commitment to ensuring a diverse energy workforce by signing on to this important challenge.""Last year, CEWD honored Exelon with the Chairman's Award, which recognizes a company for excellence in workforce development leadership. The organization also honored two Exelon companies with a Community Partner Award: Delmarva Power, for partnerships established as part of its Path to Success Program; and ComEd, for its community partnerships with Chicago Builds and CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy.More than 14,000 people have completed one of Exelon’s workforce development and job training programs since 2019, and nearly 1,300 people have been hired in family-sustaining careers. The majority of those who were offered jobs internally or externally were work-ready adult graduates of one of Exelon's infrastructure academies.Middle school, high school and college students also benefit from workforce development programs offered by Exelon and the Exelon Foundation. The company’s flagship educational program, the Exelon Foundation STEM Leadership Academy, gives young women in high school hands-on experience in STEM, energy and sustainability, with a goal of introducing the next generation of women to energy careers. More than 800 students have participated since the program launched in 2018 and 16 participants have received four-year full-ride college scholarships from the Exelon Foundation.Exelon is in the early stages of discussions with the Biden-Harris administration to determine how commitments under the Talent Pipeline Challenge could augment our programs.More information about Exelon’s workforce development programs is available at exeloncorp.com.About ExelonExelon (Nasdaq: EXC) is a Fortune 200 company and the nation’s largest utility company, serving more than 10 million customers through six fully regulated transmission and distribution utilities — Atlantic City Electric (ACE), Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), Delmarva Power &amp; Light (DPL), PECO Energy Company (PECO), and Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco).

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ComcastIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, sold US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$30.05. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Comcast Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$1.2b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Comcast Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Comcast insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Comcast.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This company, which is in the Zacks Cable Television industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This cable provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.24%.For the last reported quarter, Comcast came out with earnings of $1.01 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91 per share, representing a surprise of 10.99%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.80 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.86 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.50%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Comcast lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Comcast has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 27, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The new lift zones, which provide free, robust Wi-Fi services powered by Comcast Business solutions, will enable thousands of veterans, family members and the local community to take full advantage of everything the Internet has to offer.Comcast has started working on making a network transition to DOCSIS 4.0 technology that will help it to expand much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors in the broadband space.However, Comcast’s second-quarter 2022 results reflected a slowing broadband user-base addition.

URI as the Bull of the Day and FedEx FDX as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, TotalEnergiesSE TTE and Equinor ASA EQNR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous Industry is currently ranked in the top 21% of all Zacks Industries (52 out of 251).According to studies, 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its group, making it clear why it’s critical for investors to target stocks in a thriving industry.A stock in the realm, United Rentals, Inc. sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) paired with an overall VGM Score of an A.United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of rental locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe.URI’s customer base includes construction and industrial companies, utilities, municipalities, government agencies, independent contractors and homeowners, and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.Analysts have been bullish across the board over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Let’s take a closer look.Share PerformanceYear-to-date, URI shares have been notably defensive, down roughly 11% and widely outperforming the general market. In fact, URI shares have even outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a much longer five-year timeframe, up a triple-digit 106% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 66% return. Posting market-beating returns across several timeframes indicates that buyers have consistently been present. ValuationURI shares are more than reasonably priced, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value.The company carries a 9.3X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath its 10.8X five-year median and reflecting a rock-solid 20% discount relative to its Zacks Industry.Story continuesGrowth EstimatesURI’s growth profile is inspiring; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $31.73 for FY22 reflects a sizable 43% Y/Y uptick in earnings.Further, the company’s bottom line is projected to tack on an additional 11% of growth in FY23.And look out for URI’s upcoming quarterly print – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.88 suggests earnings growth of 35% from the year-ago quarter.Quarterly PerformanceTo top it off, United Rentals has consistently exceeded quarterly estimates, penciling in eight EPS beats over its last ten quarters. Just in its latest release, URI registered a sizable 20% bottom line beat.Revenue results paint the same positive story; URI has beat top line estimates in nine of its last ten quarterly prints. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Bottom LineOne of the best ways investors can find expected winners is by utilizing the Zacks Rank – one of the most potent market tools out there that gives investors a massive advantage.A portfolio consisting of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of 24%.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.United Rentals, Inc. would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:In an announcement that shook the market in September, FedEx withdrew its FY23 earnings forecast due to a volatile operating environment.It was a major shock, as the original guidance was given just a few months back in June, the same month that long-time CEO Fred Smith vacated his post.Following a multi-year uphill battle with the integration of its TNT Express acquisition, the news further pushed sentiment down.Analysts have taken note of the new guidance, slashing their bottom-line outlook across all timeframes with a 100% revision agreement and pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let’s take a quick look under the hood.Share PerformanceYear-to-date, FDX shares have undergone adverse price action, down nearly 40% and widely underperforming the general market. Upon viewing a longer five-year timeframe, the share performance paints a similar story; down nearly 24%, FDX shares have widely lagged behind the S&amp;P 500’s 66% gain over the last five years. As briefly mentioned earlier, a so-far unfavorable acquisition of TNT Express in 2016 has weighed heavily on the stock, with the acquisition ending up costing millions more than previously expected.Quarterly ResultsFDX has struggled to exceed bottom line estimates as of late, falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in five of its last six quarterly reports. Just in its latest print, FDX missed on the bottom line by nearly 7%.While bottom line results have left much to be desired, the company’s top line appears to be in much better shape – FDX has penciled in nine revenue beats over its last ten quarters.Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Growth EstimatesFedEx’s earnings are forecasted to take a sizable hit in its current fiscal year (FY23), with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $15.20 reflecting a steep 26% Y/Y decrease.Still, things look to kick back into the green for FY24, with estimates calling for 25% Y/Y earnings growth.Focusing more on the near-term, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $3.12 for its upcoming earnings report suggests a 35% drop off in quarterly earnings from year-ago quarterly EPS of $4.83.Bottom LineDisheartening bottom line results and recently slashed guidance paint a grim picture for the company in the short term.FedEx is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), telling us it has a weak near-term earnings outlook.Instead, investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks have a much stronger earnings outlook and potential to deliver explosive gains in the short-term.Additional content:3 Energy Companies Set to Win the Race to Net-Zero EmissionsAlthough fossil fuels are the prime sources of global energy, economies across the world are steadily transitioning to clean energy. Oil and gas companies continue to progress toward a low-carbon future, as there has been constant pressure to curb climate change.Several companies are readily modifying businesses to incorporate renewables in their operations. This year has been a game-changer as major oil producers convinced investors with their proposals to lower carbon emissions. Although renewable energy can satisfy the global energy demand, it will not eliminate oil and natural gas demand. Hydrocarbon demand will increase at a slower rate.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable consumption will grow through 2050 at an accelerating pace. Over the same period, the demand for oil and natural gas will grow, but at a slower pace. Renewables are expected to account for  95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026.As the focus on energy transition accelerates, let's look at some of the energy companies outlining net-zero commitments by 2050. Three integrated energy companies are Exxon Mobil Corporation, TotalEnergiesSE and Equinor ASA.ExxonMobil is making efforts to create more-efficient fuels while reducing emissions. XOM plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-50% by 2030 from its upstream business. The aggressive plan will be followed by the reduction in methane intensity and flaring intensity by 70-80% and 60-70%, respectively.ExxonMobil plans to invest more than $15 billion over the next six years on projects associated with reducing emissions. XOM is committed to helping customers reduce emissions by investing in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels.TotalEnergies aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and is taking the necessary measures to attain the same. TTE plans to expand the clean energy business to reach 35 gigawatts (GW) and 100 GW of gross production capacity from renewable sources by 2025 and 2030, respectively.TotalEnergies is building a portfolio of low-carbon businesses, which could account for 15-20% of sales by 2040. In the near term, TTE plans to have more than 16 GW of renewable gross capacity in operation by the end of 2022.Equinor's key strategy is to capitalize on the renewable energy space and align operations with the Paris Climate Agreement. To capitalize on the rising clean energy demand, EQNR is actively investing in renewable energy projects, comprising power generation from solar and wind energy.Equinor expects to boost production capacities from renewables to 4-6 GW by 2026. By 2035, it plans to boost the capacity to 12-16 GW. In 2021, Equinor recorded capital gains of $1.4 billion from renewables.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Analysts estimated NT$603 billion on average.Rising revenue at Apple Inc.’s most important chipmaker signals that the largest players in the $550 billion semiconductor industry may avoid the severe downturn investors have feared, helped by resilient demand for some electronics products in the face of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. Morgan Stanley this week projected a return to growth for the chip industry by the second half of 2023.Other chipmakers warned in recent weeks that they are facing a tougher market as inventories build up and orders are being cut by data center as well as consumer tech clients. Micron Technology Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. are cutting output to try and rebalance supply and avert a price crash.Earlier on Friday, Samsung Electronics Co. reported its first profit drop since 2019. Shortly before Samsung’s results, US processor and graphics chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also missed estimates with its third-quarter sales figures, which came in $1 billion shy of its own forecast.Shares of TSMC fell 2.9% in Taipei on Friday and have lost 29% this year.TSMC, the world’s most advanced maker of silicon chips, has benefited from Apple launching new types of chips to boost the performance of its devices. Still, Bloomberg reported in September the Californian company is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones, raising questions about underlying electronics demand.Story continuesWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“For now, overseas capacity expansion will be front and center, especially in the US and Japan, as TSMC pushes to meet customers’ diversification requests and rises to the challenge of growing competition from Samsung and Intel. Rapidly rising depreciation and material costs, coupled with increasing uncertainty in smartphone demand, are putting a cap on its gross margin.”--Charles Shum, Bloomberg IntelligenceClick here for the researchTo diversify beyond chips for electronics, TSMC is also seeking growth in areas such as next-generation vehicles.

Micron Technology Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. are cutting output to try and rebalance supply and avert a price crash.Shortly before Samsung’s results, US processor and graphics chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also missed estimates with its third-quarter sales figures, which came in $1 billion shy of its own forecast. “Macroeconomic conditions drove lower than expected PC demand and a significant inventory correction,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said.Samsung shares fell by as much as 2% in Seoul on Friday after the news.“This downcycle is not merely driven by typical supply and demand dynamics, it’s different from the past cycles due to geopolitical risks,” said Heo Pil-Seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management in Seoul. “The US government’s exports controls would further limit IT companies’ sales in China and a large chunk of demand for chips will be weakened. If AMD, Nvidia can’t sell their chips in China, memory makers’ earnings will deteriorate further.”Story continuesSouth Korea, home to the world’s two largest memory chipmakers, reported a decline in chip output in August for the first time in more than four years, according to Statistics Korea data. Samsung compatriot SK Hynix Inc. said during its last earnings call that a significant adjustment to its capital expenditure next year was “inevitable.”The sudden memory market crash comes after a series of macroeconomic shocks ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to soaring inflation and gas prices along with US Fed rate hikes. Consumer sentiment has rapidly deteriorated and memory buyers like PC manufacturers have reduced orders and are using their existing stockpiles.While electronics demand has crumbled this year, Morgan Stanley upgraded the semiconductor sector at the start of this week, which pushed Samsung and Hynix’s share prices up on the expectation of a market rebound in the latter half of 2023.TSMC, Chipmakers Rally After Morgan Stanley Calls a RecoveryStill, Samsung’s chip business head Kyung Kyehyun has said the memory market’s unlikely to find momentum for a recovery throughout next year. Kyung told employees at an internal event that Samsung cut its guidance for chip sales in the second half of this year by 32% compared to its forecast in April, according to the Korea Economic Daily.“Due to the extremely sluggish demand, customers began to reduce inventory from the end of 2Q22,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment &amp; Securities, noting that DRAM and NAND prices fell by 15% in the third quarter. “With the exception of some big tech companies, clients are slashing their chip orders despite sharp price cuts.”Samsung Warns Chip Industry Is Headed for Tough Close to 2022(Updates with share price and AMD earnings)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Twitter Deal Has Pierced Elon Musk’s Reality Distortion FieldHedge Fund Managers Paid for Stockpicking Genius Aren’t Showing Much of ItThe Great Post-Covid Online Shopping Bet Was a Costly DelusionA New Silicon Valley Emerges at the Arctic CircleTwitter Faces Only Bad Outcomes If the $44 Billion Musk Deal Closes©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NASDAQ:MU) as a highly attractive investment with its 7x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so limited.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Micron Technology has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology peKeen to find out how analysts think Micron Technology's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the market for P/E ratios like Micron Technology's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 50%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 39% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 4.6% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.6% per annum.In light of this, it's understandable that Micron Technology's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Micron Technology's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Micron Technology that you should be aware of.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

With an initial investment of around $20 billion, the memory chip maker plans to begin site preparation work next year and construction in 2024. The production is expected to begin in the latter half of this decade and gradually increase per the industry’s demand scenario.Does Such a Large Investment Make Sense?With the latest multi-decade investment commitment, Micron is likely to take advantage of the recently passed CHIPS and Science Act, under which the U.S. government is providing $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor research and development. MU projects to gain $5.5 billion in incentives from the state of New York over the course of the project apart from anticipated federal grants and tax credits from the CHIPS and Science Act.Moreover, Micron’s latest investment plans will help the company raise its memory chip output in the United States. The company has a long-term strategic target of bringing American-made DRAM chip production to 40% of its total global output over the next decade.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteIncreased domestic production output will facilitate a more resilient and secure supply chain of Micron’s leading-edge memory chips to the United States and global customers. The majority of the world’s semiconductor need is fulfilled by fabrication facilities in Taiwan. However, China’s hostile actions toward Taiwan have made the United States and other countries concerned about a smooth supply of semiconductors in the future.Memory chips have become one of the most important components of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing as well as the integration of AI and machine learning are fueling the demand for memory chips.Story continuesThe accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth. Apart from this, the Internet of things, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality/virtual reality and wearables are other growth prospects.Therefore, Micron’s latest move will reduce the company’s as well as the United States' dependency on foreign-made chips and ensure a more resilient and secured supply of crucial semiconductors.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Shares of MU have decreased 41.4% year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Computer and Technology sector are ASGN Incorporated ASGN, CDW Corporation CDW and MaxLinear MXL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE:FIS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-fidelity-120209928.html,1665144129,STORY,['FIS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$104 and falling to the lows of US$75.57. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Fidelity National Information Services' current trading price of US$77.65 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Fidelity National Information Services’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services Is Fidelity National Information Services Still Cheap?Fidelity National Information Services is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Fidelity National Information Services’s ratio of 55.8x is above its peer average of 26.37x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the IT industry. Furthermore, Fidelity National Information Services’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach levels around its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Fidelity National Information Services look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Fidelity National Information Services. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? FIS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe FIS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FIS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for FIS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Fidelity National Information Services at this point in time.

(NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US.

Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12.

In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

(NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9.

(NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view.

(NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

They will share their journey and experiences that led them to where they are today. Read Blanca's story below.Yum! Brands, Thursday, October 6, 2022, Press release pictureWhen faced with a life-changing crossroad, would you choose the safe and comfortable path or the unfamiliar road to unknown opportunities? Blanca V. is a reminder that most times the way to success is that road less traveled.Blanca is an Operations Consultant and is loving her role supporting Taco Bell franchisees. She is also a wife and new mother to a seven-month-old baby boy. They live in sunny Southern California and enjoy walking to the park, trying new foods and traveling. It's the All-American Dream yet her journey to this reality was no walk in the park.Born in Mexico and along with her parents and two brothers, she immigrated to the United States when she was two years old. At the age of 17, after her family went back to Mexico, she was faced with a major decision. Blanca made the choice to stay and continue her education here in the states. ""I made the difficult decision to stay and continue my senior year in high school with aspirations to go to college."" She did just that, graduating as her high school Valedictorian and later supporting herself through community college by working at other food service companies to get her foot in the door and be ready to seize her next big opportunity.Where does this incredible drive and determination come from? Well, it was a promise that she made to herself. She made it her mission to not let her circumstances affect her education and even graduated college with honors.She went on to complete her Master's of Business Administration degree while continuing to climb the work force, supporting Franchisees and Operators across the country and internationally. It was a couple of years later that an opening with Taco Bell became available. ""It was too good to pass up and I've been here ever since."" She has always been a Taco Bell fan and continues, ""Now I get to do what I love which is support and help franchisees for an amazing brand!""Story continuesWe know that life's challenges never cease to exist. Blanca admits that she frequently battles with Imposter Syndrome at work. ""I continuously remind myself that I'm meant to be here and I'm great at what I do."" She also credits her amazing coaches along the way, saying that they have helped her see the potential in herself and push her to be even better.On top of her academic and work-related accomplishments, let's circle back to the fact that Blanca is also a new mom and that it's the biggest challenge that she has faced thus far. ""The difficult newborn stage and sleep deprivation was something I was not expecting. Through all the challenges and sleepless nights, I learned that it gets better day by day. Most of all, I learned to appreciate the small wins because it helped get me through another tough day and night.""Through all her challenges, Blanca's mom has been a constant motivation. ""I work hard to make her proud and prove to her that the sacrifices she made to give me and my siblings a better life were well worth it."" Any accomplishments that she has achieved, her mom is the first person she wants to tell and celebrate with.And in the end, with every crossroads she has faced, she wants everyone to know that even if the road is unknown and maybe even a little scary, take the opportunity - you never know where it will lead you. ""I was open to the possibilities, willing to take chances, learn, and I'm so glad that I did. I could never have imagined I would be where I'm at in my career.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum! Brands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Yum!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cyclical Stocks To Buy in 2022. The performance of cyclical stocks is largely tied to economic recovery. Amid global inflation, threats of recession, and rampant rate hikes, these equities might be trading at a significant discount as investors ignore the potential for global economic rebound.In late July, Courtney Garcia, Payne Capital Market senior wealth advisor, told CNBC that investors should monitor the stock market for the next 6 to 12 months, rather than worry about what happens the next day or week. She believes that inflation will eventually ease, be it at the end of 2022 or next year, and she advised investors to maintain positions in cyclical stocks, in addition to inflation hedges like energy and commodities for a balanced portfolio. As of mid-September, analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that the US might be able to achieve a soft landing, as latest data indicates rebounding growth and bolstered consumer confidence. Markets can rally on the back of government capital stimulus in China and energy transition plans in Europe. Investors in the United States believe that inflation may have peaked, and they look forward to a stock market recovery. This is a positive catalyst for cyclical stocks, as risk appetite in the market will also increase.  Some of the best cyclical stocks to buy in 2022 include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Our Methodology We carried out a detailed assessment of cyclical industries, including restaurants, hotels, home improvement, high-end fashion retailers, and automobile manufacturers.

(NYSE:CMG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales, price increases to cover cost inflation, and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter, Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants, with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis. On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines, while digital sales declined only 3%, continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction, permitting, and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs, management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings, marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost, and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers, some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact, with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter, up 0.8% year-over-year, and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S., insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies. …” (Click here to read the full text)6.

324,5d5921a2-b0bd-31a8-813e-f7e38cb516ab,NWL,2022-10-07,Should You Investigate Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) At US$14.38?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-newell-brands-inc-nasdaq-104942320.html,1665139782,STORY,['NWL'],"[While Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$21.42 and falling to the lows of US$13.89. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Newell Brands' current trading price of US$14.38 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Newell Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Newell Brands What Is Newell Brands Worth?Great news for investors – Newell Brands is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $22.43, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Newell Brands’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Newell Brands generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Newell Brands, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -6.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although NWL is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to NWL, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWL for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Newell Brands at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Newell Brands (of which 2 don't sit too well with us!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Newell Brands, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

325,8acefafa-de16-3601-8be0-04a72b5d2a02,UPS,2022-10-07,"United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (NYSE:UPS) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 62% Above Its Share Price",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-110045228.html,1665140445,STORY,['UPS'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Is United Parcel Service Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.44bUS$9.23bUS$9.70bUS$10.2bUS$10.4bUS$10.7bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bUS$11.4bUS$11.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.15%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$8.9kUS$8.2kUS$8.1kUS$8.0kUS$7.8kUS$7.5kUS$7.2kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$76bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.1%– 1.9%) = US$283bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$283b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$156bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$232b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$166, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.988. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The new substation is expected to provide 240 megawatts (MW) of power in its initial phase and will eventually accommodate up to 1,000 MW in the future.In addition, Potomac Edison plans to reenergize a 230-kV transmission line, which previously served the property for supporting the campus. As part of the project, two transformers will be installed to reduce the high-voltage electricity coming from the substation and convert it into low-voltage power, allowing it to be effectively delivered to Quantum Frederick buildings.Need for Infrastructure UpgradeElectricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities maintained by utilities have the possibility of an equipment breakdown or failure due to the aging infrastructure. This requires the construction of new cutting-edge technology and equipment.As the demand for electricity rises in Frederick due to continued growth, this new substation will increase the capacity of the distribution system and help lessen the frequency and length of power outages for thousands of customers.FirstEnergy plans to invest $3.3 billion in 2022 and $17 billion in the 2021-2025 period to strengthen the grid and lead a clean energy transition.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 4.7% gain over the past four weeks.The recent surge in oil prices, as OPEC and its allies have agreed for steep oil production cuts, primarily drove the stock. Higher oil price will continue to drive exploration and production activities. This in turn will increase demand for oilfield services of Schlumberger.This world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +50%. Revenues are expected to be $7.1 billion, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Schlumberger, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — was up 2.2% last week. Over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 6.5%.What’s Next in the Energy World?Following last week’s mixed fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the OPEC+ decision on output cuts will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Competition from alternate sources of energy and compilation costs in a stringent regulatory environment are headwinds.TailwindsIDACORP’s regulated electric operations in Idaho generate a relatively stable and growing income stream. An expanding customer base, improvement in the economic conditions of its service territories and rising demand for clean energy are contributing to its stable performance.IDACORP projects capital expenditure of $2.8 billion for the 2022-2026 period.

The systematic investment aims to provide 100% clean energy to Idaho Power’s customers by 2045.

This compares to loss of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -166.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this agricultural and food packaging products company would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.01, delivering a surprise of 50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Landec , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $43.36 million for the quarter ended August 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $128.79 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Landec shares have lost about 21.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.6%.What's Next for Landec?While Landec has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Landec: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

If you want to read about some more financial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now.Unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the past few years have helped finance stocks demonstrate their ability to be resilient during times of crisis, boosting investor confidence and resulting in a flurry of new activity in the sector. However, per research firm Deloitte, the war in Ukraine, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of regional or global recession in 2023 still loom as near-term challenges for the industry, as more regulation and requirements around transparency also become marketplace realities. Some of the best finance stocks to monitor in this macro environment include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). As rising interest rates increase the earnings of banks overnight, recession fears continue to make investors think twice about investments in the sector. In this context, banks are leaning on the lessons learned from the uncertainty of the past few years to focus on smart strategy and execution that relies on talent, technology, risk, and purpose to drive growth. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the financial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Best Financial Stocks To Buy NowInvestments, FinanceBest Financial Stocks To Buy Now14. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29   Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The company recently said it resolved technical issues that had prevented US bank account users from making payments or withdrawals for most of the day. The firm has been on a downward spiral in the last few weeks on the back of worsening crypto futures even as analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of crypto technology. Story continuesOn September 14, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington maintained a Neutral rating on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock and raised the price target to $78 from $64, highlighting that Coinbase has a substantial revenue opportunity that originates from higher interest rates.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), compared to 46 in the preceding quarter worth $2.3 billion. Just like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Coinbase Global Inc. Ordinary Shares (NASDAQ:COIN) fell during the quarter as the crypto markets continued to suffer. While the company reported disappointing results, it committed to capping EBITDA losses at $500M even in the event of “a prolonged market downturn”. COIN’s ample liquidity ($6b in cash on hand) should enable them to survive a prolonged “crypto winter” and invest to strengthen the business in the downturn. While the crypto market is early in its adoption, Coinbase is focused on building the platform for crypto not only supporting trading, and cold storage, but moving into NFTs, staking, and crypto derivatives. We see tremendous upside potential for COIN over the next decade if they are able to successfully execute on their platform strategy.”13. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50   Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) operates as the financial services holding company for several financial institutions in the US. It is one of the top financial stocks to invest in. Reports indicate that a recent phishing campaign has targeted the bank's new partnership with verification service Authentify. In the campaign, thousands of scam emails were sent to the bank's customers to try and trick them into uploading images of their identification cards. On September 26. Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker maintained a Neutral rating on Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $125, noting that the rapid rise in Fed funds combined with outsized loan growth has led to a significant increase in funding costs for digitally-based depositories. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), with 7.85 million shares worth more than $818 million. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).”12. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a financial holding company that provides various financial products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals. It is one of the premier financial stocks to invest in. In August 2022, the company filed with the SEC to launch six ESG ETFs, the first foray into the US ETF space since the pioneering WEBS products were introduced in the 1990s. The proposed ETFs are likely to be listed in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in early 2023.On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stock and lowered the price target to $92 from $105. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Eagle Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with 13.98 million shares worth more than $1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Matrix Asset Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is one of the world’s leading investment banks and wealth management firms. As the company has grown its wealth management business its earnings have become more predictable and valuable. The management team is very shareholder-friendly, allocating funds not needed to grow the business to repurchase shares and raise their dividend. In late June, the company announced an 11% increase in its dividend and a $20 billion multi-year share repurchase program. The company’s annual dividend of $3.10 per share provides a current dividend of 3.7% at the June 30 closing price.”11. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms worldwide. It is one of the elite financial stocks to invest in. On August 4, the firm posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $1.90, beating estimates by $0.29. The revenue over the period was $2.63 billion. The firm said it was pleased with its adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $529 million and adjusted pre-tax title margin of 18.9% during the second quarter. On September 23, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane maintained a Hold rating on Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

(NYSE:FIS), compared to 68 in the preceding quarter worth $3.95 billion. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other fiscal-year detractors included Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS has been our most disappointing investment in the Covid era. Unlike Meta, the stock trades well below our average cost. The business itself has been relatively durable, but the stock certainly has not. While the core elements of our bullish thesis remain firmly intact, hindsight tells us that we could have waited for a better entry point. From today’s stock price, which is what matters now, we think the risk/reward balance is favorable.”10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a financial institution that provides a range of financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals worldwide. It is one of the most prominent financial stocks to invest in. The bank recently announced that it was expanding Transaction Banking to the European Union. Originally launched in the US in 2020 and expanded to the UK in 2021, this growth aims to deepen the relationships with existing clients who have banking needs in the EU. On September 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) stock and lowered the price target to $370 from $430. Analyst Matt O'Connor issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.6 billion in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), compared to 71 the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other activity in the period included eliminating our holding in PG&amp;E and adding a few new holdings – the luxury furniture and lifestyle company RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). A few important developments changed at PG&amp;E including higher future capex plans and changes in long-term guidance, and so we changed our mind and sold. Purchases were made on a handful of occasions in 2020 and mid-2021 at an approximate average price of $9.20 and fully sold during February 2022 at an approximate average price of $11.42, earning approximately 24%. We have for some time admired what RH’s unique leader Gary Friedman and his team have built at RH and what we think the future holds. After the shares declined more than 30% from the early December 2021 high, we established a position and have increased our holdings more recently. Referring to RH as a furniture company is technically accurate, but a very incomplete description of where the company is headed. Gary has a unique blend of management skills and we look forward to writing about this holding and potentially materially increasing the position opportunistically, cognizant that the coming housing market slowdown will likely negatively impact results at RH as well. We also initiated a position in Goldman Sachs at an inexpensive valuation and are attracted by the potential durability of the company’s ability to generate high returns on equity driven in part by the growth in their existing and new franchises.”9. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72   Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) creates tools that enable sellers to accept card payments and provides reporting and analytics, and next-day settlement. It is one of the best financial stocks to invest in. The firm recently announced that it had begun integrating the Square merchant ecosystem with Afterpay in Canada. The integration aims to provide Buy Now, Pay Later functionality to sellers using the e-commerce products of Block.On August 8, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev maintained a Buy rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stock and lowered the price target to $125 from $135, noting that the company's Q2 results were fine, but lacked the pop of quarters past.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), with 9.1 million shares worth more than $799 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund includes Wells Fargo.”8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82     Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions. The company has recently snatched another senior dealmaker from Credit Suisse. The beleaguered Swiss lender is preparing for a major restructuring of its investment bank after a series of scandals.  On September 12, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O'Connor maintained a Hold rating on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock and lowered the price target to $52 from $55, highlighting that the banks have underperformed this year largely driven by recession fears.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 82 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 88 in the previous quarter worth $8.1 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Captital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”7. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83    Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a diversified financial services company that provides banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. Mike Santomassimo, the CFO of the firm, recently said that lending growth is moderating from strong levels seen during the second quarter as the US economy slows. During the second quarter, the loans for the firm grew to $926.6 billion from $898.0 billion in Q1, and deposits of $1.45 trillion during the time slid from $1.46 trillion in Q1.On October 5, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden upgraded Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $48, up from $46, noting that the company given its ""best-in-class"" revenue upside and efficiency improvement from interest rates. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.2 billion in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), compared to 93 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year’s cash earnings without dipping into capital.

S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84  S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) provides credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. The firm recently announced that it had partnered with Tradeweb Markets, a global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets to introduce electronic connectivity between primary and secondary markets.On August 29, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau maintained an Outperform rating on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) stock and raised the price target to $419 from $404, noting that the large stabilization in capital markets injects confidence that the shares can regain their footing. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, investment firm TCI Fund Management is a leading shareholder in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), with 8.8 million shares worth more than $2.96 billion.Along with Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:Analysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks25 Largest ETFs by AUM in the World10 Largest Desalination Plants in the US Disclosure.

341,d75b6b8d-836c-3c07-b1d6-00958b49e14c,ULTA,2022-10-07,7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-recession-proof-stocks-buy-110452738.html,1664881492,STORY,"['JNJ', 'SNPS', 'KMB', 'ULTA', 'NAPA', 'MCD']","[Let me start by addressing the objection that’s likely being posed by many readers. Are there truly any recession-proof stocks? Well, recessions do pull almost every stock lower, so it’s very difficult to find completely recession-proof stocks. But there are stocks that perform fairly well during economic downturns. And investors should be looking to buy those stocks now. Because depending on one’s outlook, we are either quickly headed toward a recession or we’re already in one. The Fed ratcheted its benchmark interest rate target 75 basis points higher on Sept. 21. That hike was the third consecutive 75 basis point hike by the central bank, and the benchmark rate will likely rise above 4.25%. The Fed’s previous attempts to reduce inflation have drawn mixed results,  prompting it to raise interest rates further. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, the move could trigger additional, sharp declines by the stock market and a deep recession. As a result, investors should look to buy nearly recession-proof stocks in October. NAPADuckhorn Portfolio$14.11ORLYO’Reilly Automotive$718.20MCDMcDonald’s$235.35KMBKimberly-Clark$114.10JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$163.20SNPSSynopsys$317ULTAUlta Beauty$404.75Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA)I’ve never written about Duckhorn Portfolio (NYSE:NAPA) before. However, I think it’s interesting for a few reasons. First, data suggests that alcohol consumption increases in recessionary periods. One study shows that, in the 2008-2009 recession, total alcohol consumption increased even as rates of abstinence from alcohol increased. In other words, precedent suggests that those who drink tend to drink much more in a recession. Further, wine is emerging as an interesting alternative investment alongside other luxury items such as fine art. The idea behind investing in luxury goods during recessions is that the demand for them does not drop much during economic downturns. Duckhorn Portfolio offers wines that cost between  $50 and $200 per bottle. Its wines aren’t tremendously expensive, but they are definitely luxuries. Story continuesDuckhorn Portfolio’s most recent results indicate that the company is relatively mature, as its sales increased only 1.3% year-over-year to $91.6 million. That increase isn’t especially exciting for investors. However, it is a safe company with a firm business. For that reason, along with its status as a seller of a luxury product, I’d consider investing in NAPA stock. O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)It’s fairly obvious why O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), which sells auto parts, should do well in a recession. That’s because, during the current economic downturn,  Americans are keeping their vehicles for longer than they ever have. Back in May, it was reported that the average age of vehicles in the U.S. had reached 12.2 years. That was a new record. The older a vehicle becomes, the more repairs it requires. So O’Reilly Automotive should benefit from strong demand dynamics. Additionally, Americans are increasingly seeing their ability to save dwindle as inflation continues to pinch consumers. That increases the chances of them hanging on to older vehicles longer, raising the demand for O’Reilly Automotive’s products. In late July, O’Reilly Automotive provided guidance for a 3% to 5%  increase in its 2022 comparable store sales   Fortunately for investors, analysts’ average price  target still indicates that ORLY stock can rise much further. McDonald’s (MCD)Let’s begin with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) fundamentals. McDonald’s is growing at an impressive rate, especially for a company of its size. In its most recent reported quarter, the company’s global comparable sales increased 9.7%  year-over-year while its U.S. comparable sales climbed 3.7% during the same period. Those fundamentals suggest McDonald’s remains on firm footing. That’s a positive for investors. But investors must also consider McDonald’s trajectory in a recession. Fortunately, it is one of the better-known defensive stocks. MCD stock held its value during the 2008-2009 recession trading around $58 for the duration. And over the last ten years, it has performed very well, providing 14% average annual returns for investors, not including its dividend. That dividend is extremely safe, having last been reduced in 1977. Consider MCD stock for its performance, its inexpensive menu offerings that should perform well as purse strings tighten, and its dividend that is just about guaranteed. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Investors should seriously consider Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock to appease some of their recession concerns. Let’s begin with a simple argument that relies on price precedents for Kimberly-Clark. Over the past three years, Kimberly-Clark stock has traded in a range around the $130 level. It has gone higher, but for the most part, investors can expect that it will remain at or above that $130 range. In fact,  analysts’ average price target for the shares sits at $131.44. The issue for Kimberly-Clark is one common to most businesses currently: higher costs. In fact, the firm reported that its costs increased by $405 million in the most recent reported quarter. That has some investors worried and is evidenced by the average rating on KMB stock which is a “hold.” But at the same time, Kimberly-Clark beat analysts’ average EPS estimates in the quarter as well. Apparently, the firm is handling those higher costs in an effective manner. I’d buy KMB stock on that notion and because it includes a quarterly dividend of $1.16. It’s a well-known defensive stock within a consumer staples sector that historically enjoys inelastic demand. For those reasons, KMB’s shares are worth considering. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)The reasons to invest in Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are simple. In this case, as in others, simple is best. The healthcare sector is noted for its recessionary strengths. Healthcare, as a whole, has tended to outperform during recessions of the past. That will very likely be true this time around as well. In fact, there’s already a lot of evidence supporting this notion. Just look at JNJ stock’s price in 2022. It has barely slipped, falling a minuscule 4.6% thus far. Analysts, on average, believe it can climb roughly $20 above its current price. Like any of the so-called dividend kings – companies that have raised their dividend for 50 or more years – also consider JNJ stock for the income that it provides. Finally, consider JNJ stock because the company, like all successful firms,  invests prudently. That truth is evidenced by its return on invested capital of 17.38%. That ROIC far exceeds the firm’s weighted average cost of capital of 5.83%. When ROIC exceeds WACC, value is created for shareholders. That’s why JNJ remains steady in unsteady times and how JNJ has provided investors with a growing dividend since 1963. Synopsys (SNPS)Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock is a semiconductor firm that is heavily invested in the evolution towards the internet of things. It markets itself as a provider of high-tech chips that power everything from self-driving vehicles to machine learning, to the internet of things, and more. Investors should be interested in SNPS stock because of its fundamentals. In its most recent, reported quarter, the company posted revenue of $1.248 billion, up from $1.057 billion during the same period a year earlier. Synopsys also provided guidance for similar revenue in current quarter. It expects sales of between $5.06 and $5.09 billion for the full year. Semiconductor stocks haven’t performed well in 2022. The PHLX Semiconductor Index has declined nearly  40% in2022. Synopsys looks like an outlier within the sector. because its revenues and net income increased in the first half of 2022 and in Q2. As a result, its shares have only declined by 14% this year. It is riskier than the stocks in other sectors, but SNPS stock has the potential to be a chip stock that performs well in a recession. Wall Street analysts, on aver age, have a “buy” rating on the shares.   That alone is a strong signal as tech and semiconductor industries have been roiled by the swift changes in  monetary policy. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)The case for investing in Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) stock relies upon the notion that demand for its products is relatively inelastic. Past recessions have yielded data suggesting that the demand for cosmetics remains relatively strong during recessions. More specifically, data shows that, during recessions,  women will indulge in discretionary purchases that aren’t too extravagant. Among these purchases are lipstick and other cosmetics. this phenomenon has been referred to as the ‘Lipstick Effect’.That notion seems to have been illustrated by Ulta Beauty’s recent earnings report. If you’re like me and believe that we’re currently in recession, then the fact that Ulta’s sales increased to $2.3 billion from $2 billion bodes well. That suggests that its beauty products are indeed performing well even as consumers continue to become increasingly stretched. Additionally, Ulta Beauty’s revenues have grown very in the past few years. For roughly the firsts even months of 2020, the firm recorded $2.4 billion of  sales. During the same period two years later the company reported $4.64 billion of sales. It’s clear that consumers appreciate its product offerings. And data suggests that cosmetics benefit from inelastic demand, so buying ULTA stock is a wise choice. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

352,3cc47dd1-f100-3805-98c2-b59411cc2fc0,WM,2022-10-07,"Why Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-waste-management-inc-nyse-110010834.html,1665140410,STORY,['WM'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Waste Management How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:30% = US$2.1b ÷ US$7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.Does Waste Management Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Waste Management has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Waste Management's Debt And Its 30% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Waste Management, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.88. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy.

353,d7e5689f-9244-3d31-a8ce-f205ee638ad5,INTU,2022-10-07,7 Nasdaq Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-nasdaq-sleeper-stocks-buy-205231416.html,1664830351,STORY,"['NFLX', 'NVDA', 'DLTR', 'FIVE', 'KDP', 'UPWK', 'INTU']","[The search for Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy remains one many aggressive investors are on. However, at first glance, this search is one that seems incredibly risky. After all, compared to the other major equity indices, the technology-centric Nasdaq has suffered disproportionately. Much of this is due to an increasingly hawkish Federal reserve, with a monetary framework that doesn’t necessarily bode well for risk-taking.Recently, the Federal Reserve decided to take on an interest rate hiking cycle, effectively restricting the money supply. Theoretically, such an action should mitigate inflation by reducing demand, thereby promoting deflationary forces. With deflation causing the dollar’s purchasing power to rise, investors have an incentive merely to sit on cash. That’s not great for Nasdaq sleeper stocks (or any other equities).Still, the mad rush for the exits leaves many opportunities open for bold contrarian investors. Of course, one would have to be audacious to consider the below ideas. But if that happens to suit your style, these Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy could positively light up your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUPWKUpwork$14.06DLTRDollar Tree$141.65FIVEFive Below$141.25INTUIntuit$396.80KDPKeurig Dr. Pepper$36.87NFLXNetflix$239.04NVDANvidia$125.12Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as Elance-oDesk, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) represents a freelancing platform. The company helps bring independent contractors all over the world to connect with organizations with specific business needs. Bidding on available projects, Upwork unlocks value through introducing businesses to previously unidentified independent talent. From there, the sky’s the limit.Upwork launched its initial public offering in October 2018. As of this writing, Upwork features a market capitalization of $1.84 billion. Since the start of this year, UPWK hemorrhaged 59% of equity value, making it a very underappreciated opportunity. Still, it might be an ideal candidate for Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy.Story continuesFundamentally, Upwork benefits strongly from trajectories bolstering the gig economy. Experts in the field project that this economic subsegment will command gross volume of $455.2 billion by 2023. Further, with companies recalling their employees back to the office, Upwork could see increased demand from disgruntled former cubicle warriors.Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissDollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is simply a dollar discount store. Historically, the company got its name because everything in its stores was priced at a buck or less. Last year, though, Dollar Tree cheated up, offering products at $1.25. On paper, this action enabled the company to provide a wider range of merchandise.Dollar Tree has been trading as a public entity since 1995. At time of writing, the dollar store features a market cap of $31.72 billion. Despite relevancies associated with economic challenges, DLTR has not performed outstandingly this year, up just 1%.With the Fed imposing a deflationary ecosystem, the main risk centers on a rough landing – as in, a recession. Should this worst fear materialize, job losses could mount. Cynically, this narrative implies that Dollar Tree could experience rising demand. Thus, the red ink might only be temporary.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAlong the same vein as Dollar Tree above, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) presents a compelling storyline. A chain of specialty discount stores, Five Below mostly sells products priced less than $5; hence the name. However, it also provides an assortment of products priced between $6 and $25. Primarily, the company targets tweens and teens.FIVE stock began trading in the public equities sphere back in 2012. Presently, the company features a market cap of $7.8 billion. While the backdrop of Five Below (rough economic headwinds) should boost shares, FIVE fell over 31% on a year-to-date basis. However, this dynamic also implies that it could be one of the best Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy.The last sentence assumes that the discount retailer can attract customers through its doors. With the Fed possibly en route to spark a rough landing, that wouldn’t be a surprising outcome.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com labels Five Below significantly undervalued. The retailer commands excellent longer-term growth and profitability metrics.Intuit (INTU)An image of Intuit Turbotax booksSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.comI’m going to break form a bit here and let the fundamentals speak for tax software firm Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). Succinctly speaking, Intuit is one of the Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy because it plays into the aforementioned gig economy. Here’s what Politico.com had to say on the matter.“The IRS already knows from the W-2 filed by your employer how much you make in wages, and it already knows from forms filed by your financial service providers how much you earn in interest, dividends and capital gains—as well as how much you contribute to your individual retirement account.”Thus, for several millions of taxpayers “who claim the standard deduction and have no other income sources or writeoffs, that information is all they need to calculate their taxes accurately.” Exactly. However, independent contractors or gig workers must file 1099 forms. Speaking from personal experience, that can get very complicated.Fortunately, we have companies like Intuit that can help first-time gig workers navigate this tax minefield. Long term, INTU is a buy, irrespective of its status as one of the Nasdaq sleeper stocks.Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP)Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a buildingSource: ShutterstockAn American beverage and coffeemaker conglomerate, Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) may be one of the safer market ideas right now. While tech-driven names predominantly occupy the Nasdaq exchange, many (if not most) of these businesses feature discretionary profiles. In contrast, beverages tie in with biological needs, thus supporting Keurig Dr. Pepper.Prior to the merger between Keurig Green Mountain and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, the predecessor entity began trading in 2008. Currently, Keurig Dr. Pepper features a market cap of $52 billion. Since the January opener this year, KDP stock only lost about 2%, reflecting the resilience of its underlying industry. However, it lost about 5% of market value over the trailing week, meaning that some stakeholders are abandoning ship.That might be a mistake. Cynically, should tough circumstances materialize in the economy, KDP provides two pick-me-up commodities: caffeine via Keurig and sugar via Dr. Pepper and other beverage brands. Gurufocus.com labels KDP a fairly valued enterprise, noting its solid profitability metrics.Netflix (NFLX)The Netflix logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.comStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) once dominated the entertainment sector during the initial onset of Covid-19. With nothing to do and with live sports shut down, many turned to in-home entertainment. Naturally, streaming services along with video games benefitted from a hostage audience.Today, though, circumstances shifted, in part due to phenomena such as revenge travel. No longer satisfied with digital entertainment, consumers opted for the real thing. That left little room for streaming. Sure enough, Netflix suffered uncharacteristic losses in subscriber count. As a result, NFLX hemorrhaged over 62% of market value. Still, it could be one of the Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy.Fundamentally, Netflix is better positioned to serve the entertainment market in the current population growth paradigm. On an extremely long-term basis, the streaming audience will be geared more heavily toward adults, which benefits Netflix’s grittier content.Also, Netflix doesn’t really own decades-old fan-favorite entertainment franchises. Therefore, the constant pressure to live up to a prior heritage is simply non-existent.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockSemiconductor firm and tech innovator Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) presents a sort of rags-to-riches-to-rags narrative. Following the spring doldrums of 2020, NVDA skyrocketed as in-home entertainment platforms took off. This backdrop suited Nvidia just fine since the company specializes in graphics processing units. Then, those same GPUs helped undergird the cryptocurrency rally of 2021.Today, the storyline for NVDA looks incredibly dour. Since the start of this year, the security dropped nearly 59%. Even in the near term, the bearish sentiment hasn’t let up. In the trailing month, NVDA slipped over 8%. Nevertheless, the currently poor results make for an argument that NVDA is one of the Nasdaq sleeper stocks to buy.For one thing, video games will likely always be popular. According to data cited by the World Economic Forum, the global gaming industry could be worth $321 billion by 2026. Second, cryptos will almost surely make another comeback after they’re done going through their current bearish cycle.Therefore, if you’re willing to patiently ride some volatility, NVDA may be one of the better Nasdaq sleeper stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

358,84486875-96e2-372d-b516-a00170e426ab,SRE,2022-10-07,Why Sempra (SRE) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-sempra-sre-great-dividend-154503619.html,1665071103,STORY,['SRE'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Sempra in FocusHeadquartered in San Diego, Sempra (SRE) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 16.06% so far this year. The natural gas and electricity provider is paying out a dividend of $2.28 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.98% compared to the Utility - Gas Distribution industry's yield of 3.13% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.58 is up 4.1% from last year. Sempra has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.77%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Sempra's current payout ratio is 52%, meaning it paid out 52% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SRE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.65 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 2.61%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SRE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

359,f1706f1a-cfab-317c-97aa-e5da6ae7e869,VMC,2022-10-07,7 Stocks to Sell Amid a Commodity Crash,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-sell-amid-commodity-173801333.html,1664818681,STORY,"['X', 'KW=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F', 'LB=F', 'O=F', 'SI=F', 'VMC', 'NUE', 'MP', 'ALB', 'OXY', 'NEM']","[Headline inflation numbers continue to run near their highest levels in 40 years. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 more basis points in September. Analysts are rightly nervous about how long this rising-price period will persist.However, one key sector of the economy is already signaling that the worst of the inflation has already passed. That indicator is commodities. Numerous commodities spiked in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this spring. Agricultural products were particularly impacted.Since then, however, wheat, corn, soybeans and oats, among others, have given back most or all of their post-invasion gains. The price of lumber has slumped by more half from its prior 2022 high. The price of copper, a key metal for electronics and construction, has dove this summer. Precious metals have reversed their prior rally. Oil has fallen back below $100 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLong story short, the surge in commodities is now turning into a crash.It’s unlikely that prices will return all the way to pre-pandemic levels. However, the commodity boom we saw in March 2022 also appears to have gotten significantly out of hand. That being the case, investors should be prepared to lock in gains on commodity stock positions. Here are seven commodity-related stocks to sell before the end of 2022.NUENucor$114.61MPMP Materials$28.85XU.S. Steel$19.58ALBAlbemarle$271.58NEMNewmont$43.86VMCVulcan Materials$160.32OXYOccidental Petroleum$64.34Nucor (NUE)Nucor logo close-up on website page. NUE stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockSteelmaker Nucor (NYSE:NUE) sent shockwaves through its industry earlier in September. The company updated its guidance for Q3 of this year, with the revised figure coming in well below the market’s prior expectations. Now, Nucor envisions earning roughly $6.35 per share in the current quarter. That’s a massive drop from the $9.67 per share it earned last quarter.Story continuesNucor pointed to falling profit margins and reduced shipping volumes for product compared to past periods. This gets back to the bigger issue with steel. It’s a massively boom-bust industry, with players going from record profits to outright losses over and over.Investors tend to fixate on the high profit numbers. NUE stock is trading at roughly five times this year’s estimated earnings, which might sound like a steal. But analysts expect profits to drop by nearly two-thirds over the next two years. The falling demand for housing, autos and other big-ticket items after a record 2021 will hit cyclical players such as steel producers hard.Nucor will be a buy again once the economy stabilizes, but for now, it’s wise to avoid the stock until earnings stop sliding.MP Materials (MP)Best rare earth stocks: a pile of rare earth metalsSource: Joaquin Corbalan P / ShutterstockMP Materials (NYSE:MP) is a mining company focused on rare earth materials such as neodymium. You may remember the company as Molycorp. That predecessor firm had a stock that went up tenfold at one point but ultimately went bankrupt in 2015 when the commodity cycle turned south.MP Materials grabbed Molycorp’s mine out of bankruptcy and is now publicly traded following a SPAC deal. Once again, traders have gravitated to MP stock, thanks to geopolitical uncertainty with China. Rare earth materials are in (relatively) short supply, and having a U.S.-based mine could be a strategic asset.However, price plays a key role. MP stock is still trading at three times its initial SPAC offering price. That’s a rather lofty valuation compared to almost all other SPACs as of late. Meanwhile, the price of neodymium has fallen by nearly half since its February peak. Combine a weakening profit outlook with the fading momentum for mining stocks and MP shares could give back much of their gains.United States Steel (X)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor is far from the only steel stock vulnerable to a downturn in pricing and demand. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stands out as another industry player that traders should sell now.Historically, U.S. Steel has been even more of a boom-bust entity than Nucor since it has a higher cost profile. U.S. Steel has had various years where it lost money during down cycles. Analysts expect big problems for the company once again. Current analyst forecasts suggest the firm’s profits will drop 26% this year, plunge 70% next year, and fall another 39% in 2024. All told, that would take the company’s earnings from more than $15 per share on a trailing basis to less than $2 per share by 2024.A lot of traders see X stock going for less than two times trailing earnings and think the stock must be the deal of the century. But those earnings were exceptionally temporary in nature. With the economy turning south, energy prices rising and demand from China looking sluggish, look for U.S. Steel’s recent prosperity to come to an abrupt end.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comUnlike most of the other stocks on the list, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is still enjoying peak enthusiasm. In fact, ALB stock hit new 52-week highs in September.On the face of it, everything seems to be going right for the gigantic lithium producer. Lithium demand is surging thanks to electric vehicles and other renewable power applications which require batteries. The recent Inflation Reduction Act should provide further subsidies to drive adoption. And the nation of Chile, where Albemarle has extensive operations, just rejected a proposed anti-business constitutional reform process.So what’s not to like?For one thing, shares have already run up 15% this year. 15 times earnings doesn’t seem excessive, but earnings may come under pressure as additional supplies of lithium come online. Additionally, the current electricity squeeze we’re seeing in various markets such as Europe and California may slow down the momentum for electric vehicles a bit. Albemarle is a good company. But shares are prone to a technical correction here, especially as commodity stocks in general are in a broad selloff.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is one of the world’s largest precious metals mining companies. To that point, it has more than 92 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.Unfortunately for investors, the bull case around gold has failed to play out as expected. With the surge in inflation, gold and silver were supposed to soar to new heights. Instead, they rallied modestly and then sputtered out. If gold can’t work as an inflation hedge now, amid unprecedented rising prices, when is it going to pan out?Meanwhile, even after the sharp decline in the price of NEM stock, shares still aren’t cheap. Newmont is currently going for around 18 times this year’s estimated earnings. And analysts see earnings dropping in both 2o22 and 2023. Bulls can point to the company’s 5% dividend yield as a saving grace. But with earnings forecast to come in around $2.50 per share this year, there’s little margin of error for Newmont’s current dividend. With precious metals falling, profits stagnant, and a possible dividend cut on the horizon, Newmont is a sell today.Vulcan Materials (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) is a leading producer of aggregates that are used in construction. Building materials have been a great place to be over the past year. Vulcan sells into the housing market, which was scorching hot until a few months ago. It’s also big in providing materials used in road construction; this area gained investor enthusiasm thanks to the passage of the federal infrastructure package.Vulcan is a better business than it might seem like due to geographical advantages. Namely, aggregates are exceptionally heavy and thus it’s not cost-effective to ship them far. As a result, Vulcan often tends to have monopolies on local markets and get good pricing power when it sells products.However, there are limits to how much this sort of business is worth. And VMC stock is currently testing said limits. At 30x this year’s estimated earnings, Vulcan stock is going at a hefty premium for a company that sells concrete, asphalt and other such basic goods. Throw in a slowing housing market, and Vulcan shares seem set to deflate a bit from their currently lofty perch.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlmost all of the major oil and gas stocks look cheap based on their current earnings outlooks. Despite big gains in their share prices over the past 18 months, oil stocks still seem like reasonable bets to close out 2022.But not all oil companies are created equal. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is infamous for its questionable capital allocation decisions. Specifically, its move to overpay when acquiring Anadarko in 2019 led the company to a liquidity crunch. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stepped in with financing for Occidental at the time and has made a small fortune off that prescient move.Fast forward to today and Berkshire continues adding to its stake in Occidental. This may make sense from Buffett’s position as a large shareholder that can influence the business.For minority shareholders, however, Occidental remains a company with an unimpressive track record and a fairly middling collection of oil assets. With oil prices now backing off their recent peak, this is a great time to rotate out of a riskier oil stock like Occidental and into more trustworthy ones with greater operational stability.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BRK-B stock.

Prosecutors said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a ""bug bounty,"" rather than a data breach.Sullivan's legal team said that after the hackers signed nondisclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. But Sullivan now faces a five year prison sentence for obstruction and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalanick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye.Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring. The company laying off workers at its offshore wind unit, as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays, according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind units' US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers. Wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business. But the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand.And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. It's the second time in the last couple of months. The cheapest version now retails for just under $52,000. That's roughly a 30% increase from the original starting price of about $40,000 when it first went on sale in May. Ford said in a statement, ""The increases are the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors.""]"

However, the purchase is proving to be an expensive wager as insiders are yet to get ahead of their losses which currently stand at US$598k since the time of purchase.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp for US$4.8m worth of shares, at about US$75.26 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$67.44 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 75.54k shares for US$5.7m. But they sold 1.44k shares for US$107k. Overall, General Electric insiders were net buyers during the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$180m.

367,9a80872c-b207-3190-b549-d075cb65fbcc,PGR,2022-10-07,Progressive (PGR) to Report Q3 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-pgr-report-q3-results-140002613.html,1665064802,STORY,['PGR'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Progressive (PGR) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +964.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.15 billion, up 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Progressive?For Progressive, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Progressive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Progressive would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Progressive appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

370,5a167541-b62c-30a0-9b3d-e09584acc0b8,VLO,2022-10-07,10 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-ethanol-stocks-buy-130635438.html,1665061595,STORY,"['NG=F', 'KW=F', 'REX', 'AMTX', 'MEOH', 'ANDE', 'ADM', 'VLO']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best ethanol stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more ethanol stocks, go directly to 5 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now.The increasing emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly products has resulted in a rise in demand for ethanol over the past few years. Ethanol, mainly derived from crops such as sugar, wheat, and corn, can be added to crude products in order to reduce their overall carbon emissions, thus reducing pollution. The price for ethanol is rising as countries shift focus towards the energy transition in the wake of global warming policy initiatives. In the short-term, a poor start to the new corn marketing year and high prices are weighing on the ethanol sector. According to a recent study, the global ethanol market will rise at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5% over the next five years to reach $129 billion in value by 2027. Some of the best ethanol stocks expected to benefit from this boom include Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM). The US remains the largest producer of ethanol because of the ease of availability of raw materials that are required for production.Besides the US, the market in South America is expected to witness considerable growth in the coming years, driven by the presence of several large scale producers of ethanol in the region. The ethanol market is broadly divided into two important ethanol products, synthetic ethanol and bioethanol. The raw materials required for production include kernels and starchy crops biomass, lignocellulosic biomass, Algal biomass, and industrial waste carbon dioxide, in addition to petroleum derived chemicals. Ethanol Industry Outlook for 2022-2023Some of the major industries that make use of ethanol include transportation, energy, and the chemical sectors. Corn-based ethanol production in the US has fallen to unusually low levels in the past few weeks, per data released by the Department of Energy in the country. In the short-term energy outlook, the Energy Information Administration reduced the 2022-23 ethanol outlook to 5.325 billion bushels, slightly below the 5.33 billion estimated for 2021-22. This accounts for 37% of total 2022-23 US corn use, the highest share in four years.Story continuesAccording to the government, US ethanol production will average just a little over 1.01 million barrels per day in 2022, down from the August forecast of 1.02 million barrels per day. Presently, the agency forecasts that ethanol production will average 1 million barrels per day in 2023. For context, ethanol production averaged 980,000 barrels per day in 2021. On a quarterly basis, ethanol production is expected to average 1.01 million barrels per day during the third quarter of 2022, increasing to 1.02 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. In 2023, ethanol production is expected to average 1 million barrels per day in the first and second quarters, falling to 990,000 in the third quarter, and expanding to 1.02 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Fuel ethanol blending is expected to average 910,000 barrels per day in 2022, expanding to 920,000 barrels per day in 2023. Recent traffic trends suggest that fuel demand may be improving, but a subpar US corn crop could disrupt the ethanol industry, especially if harvest results are worse than expected, per news agency Reuters. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the ethanol sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.10 Best Ethanol Stocks To Buy NowT photography / Shutterstock.comBest Ethanol Stocks To Buy Now10.

375,4bab764a-7d6a-37c7-9605-8d42e3bc587b,LKQ,2022-10-07,7 Auto Stocks to Watch Going Into Q4,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-auto-stocks-watch-going-182859805.html,1664821739,STORY,"['TSLA', 'LKQ', 'TTM', 'GT', 'F']","[This should be an interesting end to the year for auto stocks.First, you’ve got the White House shifting into high gear on President Joe Biden’s push into electric vehicles. Biden announced approval of the first $900 million that will be spent in the U.S. to build EV charging stations throughout 35 states. The effort is all part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that was approved late last year.Then you have the lingering shortage of semiconductors, which are critical for building both EVs and gasoline-powered vehicles. Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) projects that the shortage will continue through the middle of next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThrow in record inflation in the U.S., rising interest rates and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and you’ve got an incredibly dynamic set of factors that will weigh on auto stocks in the fourth quarter.How do you cut through the mess? Here’s a start, as we look at seven top auto stocks that you should be paying attention to as we head into the final months of 2022.GTGoodyear Tire &amp; Rubber$10.70FFord$11.55TSLATesla$242.74TTMTata Motors$24.40LKQLKQ Corporation$48.90XPELXpel$64.72LCIDLucid Motors$13.84The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (GT)Interesting Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (GT) Put and Call OptionsSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comUntil The Jetsons comes to life or until we finally get those cool hoverboards promised to us in Back to the Future, it appears that vehicles will continue to need tires for a long time – no matter how the engines are powered.The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) traces its history more than 100 years. Its footprint includes manufacturing facilities in 23 countries, and it makes tires under the Sava, Dunlop, Goodyear, Cooper Tires, Fulda, Kelly Tires and Debica brands.Granted, GT stock is down by 50% so far this year. But the company is also consistently beating analysts’ expectations when it’s time to issue an earnings report.Story continuesThe most recent report – Q2 2022 – was no different. Revenue of $5.21 billion was better than the $4.98 billion that analysts expected. Earnings per share of 46 cents was 9 cents per share better than the Street expected.Goodyear could be a company vulnerable to a recession – the American Automobile Association reports drivers are more inclined to put off tire replacements in an economic downturn. But the company’s products will remain in demand – and the buyers will return as the economy improves.GT stock is on sale these days and has a “C” rating in my Portfolio Grader.Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comLegacy American automaker Ford (NYSE:F) is rapidly making the transition to EVs. It boasts a growing lineup of EV models, and it’s committed to selling 600,000 EVs annually by the end of next year.Ford even has an EV version of its famed F-150 pickup, the F-150 Lightning. The company just announced a price hike as it’s reopening orders for the F-150 Lightning, bumping the price between $6,000 and $8,500 higher and raising the minimum price to $47,000.Earnings for the second quarter were sterling. Revenue of $37.91 billion was a 56% increase from a year ago, and beat analysts’ expectations of $35.18 billion. EPS of 68 cents per share was better than the 45 cents that analysts predicted.F stock is down by 45% this year, but it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Tesla (TSLA)A black Tesla (TSLA) Model S is parked between rows of charging stations.Source: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.comYou can’t call Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a legacy automaker. CEO Elon Musk is far too much of a maverick to be a legacy anything – but that seems to have worked out for Tesla. The EV company is the arguable leader in the space, with a market cap of more than $700 billion that leaves all the other companies in the dust.TSLA stock down 30% so far on the year, but as I wrote recently, the company will surely rebound in the near future. As EVs become more commonplace and the U.S. rolls out its network of charging stations, Tesla will be even more popular.Need more convincing? Don’t forget to look at the numbers. Q2 revenue of $16.93 billion matched expectations, and EPS of 76 cents was much better than the 60 cents per share that analysts expected.TSLA stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Tata Motors Limited (TTM)A Tata Motors sign in New Delhi, India. TTM stockSource: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.comIt’s time to diversify your selection of auto stocks. U.S.-based stocks have plenty of headwinds, as discussed. But if you want to look at investing in a group of auto stocks, then India-based Tata Motors (NYSE:TTM) is a tempting target.Tata Motors got its start nearly 80 years ago as a manufacturer of locomotives. But by the 1990s it was a serious player in passenger vehicles.Since then, Tata Motors has grown into a company with a market cap of more than $17 billion. Subsidiaries include Jaguar Land Rover, which makes Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, as well as South Korea’s Tata Daewoo. Tata Motors also has 75% of the EV market in India. Its Nexon EV gets roughly 3,500 orders per month.While earnings have been a disappointment (TTM missed on both top- and bottom-line fiscal Q1 2023 numbers) there’s significant potential here, particularly as some of the headwinds facing EV stocks begins to clear.TTM stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.LKQ Corporation (LKQ)The LKQ Corporation (LKQ) logo is displayed on a smartphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBased in Chicago, LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) is a specialty parts provider for vehicles, specializing in salvage and recycled auto parts. That’s particularly important as people are holding onto the vehicles longer than ever these days.LKQ bills itself as the largest provider of what it calls “alternative vehicle collision replacement products.”While that paints a picture of gasoline-powered combustion engines, LKQ is gearing up for the EV evolution. According to the company, EVs have fewer components than cars powered by a combustion engine, and therefore have lower servicing costs. So, if people are going to invest big bucks in an electric vehicle, they theoretically have a greater opportunity to keep it for longer periods of times because the repairs should be easier.Last year, LKQ bought a North Carolina company, Green Bean Battery, that repurposes EV batteries.LKQ stock is down 19% so far this year, but its earnings over the last 12 months have nearly always beat on both top and bottom lines. The only exception was in the second quarter, in which LKQ missed revenue estimates of $3.39 billion by posting $3.34 billion. But even then, it topped EPS projections by 7 cents per share by posting $1.09.LKQ stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.XPEL (XPEL)Cars on an urban highway driving into the sunsetSource: Anna Kraynova / ShutterstockIf you want to hold on to your car for a long time and want to keep it looking in too shape, then XPEL (NASDAQ:XPEL) may be the answer you’re looking for among auto stocks. The Texas-based company is known for its protective films and coatings, including automotive paints. It also provides products for vehicle wraps, window tinting and ceramic coating. For the interior, its products include antimicrobial film for touch screens, displays and other surfaces.In July, it was reported that BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) the investment managing firm, purchased a 10% stake in XPEL.For the second quarter, XPEL announced revenue of $83.89 million, which beat analysts’ expectations for $78.55 million. Earnings of 43 cents per share also topped expectations of 34 cents per share.Despite an up-and-down 2022, XPEL stock is down by only 5% on the year. And it has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Lucid Group (LCID)The Lucid Motors (LCID) Plant in Arizona.Source: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comIt hasn’t all been roses for Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock. Down a whopping 60% so far this year, Lucid has failed – so far – to mount a serious challenge to Tesla.But, as I wrote recently, there’s plenty of reason to like Lucid stock, particularly given the superior design and positive reviews the EVs are getting.On top of that, Lucid’s batteries seem to be superior to Tesla’s, with R.F. Lafferty analyst Jamie Perez calling it a “key differentiator” between the two companies. Perez set a $19 price target and issued a “buy” rating.But revenues remain minimal for now as the company has slashed production projections as it tries to get off the floor. Revenue for the second quarter was only $97.34 million, or 38% less than the $157.12 million that the Street expected. The company also posted a loss of 33 cents per share, which was worse than the 31-cent loss that analysts projected.Currently LCID stock has a “C” rating in the Portfolio Grader, but it needs more production before it mounts a serious challenge to Tesla.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held a position in F stock.

379,437f21df-5713-3a53-b9f4-2b85c9bb80a3,ADP,2022-10-07,"A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-automatic-data-140057397.html,1665064857,STORY,['ADP'],"[How far off is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.3%– 1.9%) = US$142bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$142b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$78bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$116b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$239, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.017. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

""Not only did I learn about the reality of school budget restrictions on period products, but also the troubling ways students would offset their needs for these products by making makeshift pads and tampons out of items such as socks, towels and toilet paper.

""Since the launch of Always’ #EndPeriodPoverty program in 2018, Always has donated more than 160 million period products to people in need around the world. While donations can help young people stay in school and improve confidence, donations alone cannot resolve period poverty as poverty itself is a systemic issue. To help drive systemic change, we continue to expand our #EndPeriodPoverty efforts this year by supporting the Menstrual Equity for All Act – which would help systemically end period poverty in the U.S. With our allies on the Hill and the grassroot efforts of our 50 Period Heroes, we’re excited about the bigger impact we are making on young people who are experiencing period poverty in this country.""Footnotes:1 1000 U.S. females, 16-24 y.o., Research Now ‘17About Always®Always®, the world's leader in menstrual protection, offers a wide range of pads, wipes and liners designed to fit different body types, period flows and preferences.

Go With the Flow has provided schools in Tucson and Phoenix and neighboring areas with over 40,000 period packs - small bags that contain tampons, sanitary napkins, and panty liners. When a student at a participating school needs menstrual supplies, they can approach various school staff to obtain a period pack. Schools can contact Go With The Flow for additional packs whenever they are running low, helping to ensure a continuous supply of menstrual hygiene products for students at no cost to the school.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221005005876/en/ContactsLouie MoranteProcter &amp; Gamblemorante.l@pg.comTalya LefkowitzMSL Grouptalya.lefkowitz@mslgroup.com]"

After Scott explained what he'd said to her, she, and April Cecilia, IT Senior Vice President, had the idea to sponsor a professional 10-month American Sign Language (ASL) course, which now has more than two dozen P&amp;G employees enrolled - with more to come - as it draws excited interest and inspires employees across the company.Collectively, the world's approximately 72 million D/deaf* persons use over 300 different sign languages (World Federation of the Deaf). This International Day of Sign Languages and every day, we honor P&amp;G's D/deaf community and hard of hearing consumers by taking action to ensure we create an inclusive environment that enables us to uniquely see the people we serve and to uniquely serve the people we see-and develop the superior products our consumers rely upon in their daily lives.Our company values are best expressed through our employees. It's vital to us that they are supported and feel free to show up as 100% their authentic selves. This means creating an environment of diversity and inclusion - one where we build on our unique differences to strengthen our company and widen its positive impact in the world.Creating Inclusive Spaces for Everyone to WorkP&amp;G's Iowa City plant has become an incredible model of inclusivity in action. Currently, the plant has four Deaf employees, including Hannah Meyer who is driving a culture of inclusivity with other D/deaf employees by making great progress to ensure manufacturing is safer and more inclusive for deaf employees - and thereby - more efficient, safer and smarter for all employees.Instead of only alarms sounding to alert teams as would happen in a typical plant, in Iowa City, adaptations have been made that include smart watches that buzz employees and television screens that display messages to alert employees of potential hazards and provide important updates. In the Practice Team Rooms, Iowa City also has ASL signage to teach other employees at the plant. They've also brought on a contract sign language interpreter to facilitate team communication and help colleagues learn to sign.Story continuesHarnessing inclusive leaders and trail blazing talentWe currently also have several D/deaf full-time employees at our Cincinnati headquarters and are intentionally growing this number. With leadership from P&amp;G's deaf community, we're recruiting talented new team members to push the envelope on creative approaches to building a pipeline of new D/eaf and hard of hearing talent. As part of this, we have activated partnerships with universities, including Gallaudet University and Rochester Institute of Technology with National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and for the past two summers, students from each program have worked at P&amp;G. These young trailblazers have brought unique perspectives and have given valuable input into many areas of our business. This includes updates for the P&amp;G STEM website, designing creative logos like the P&amp;G logo in ASL and providing insights into P&amp;G's interview process to ensure D/eaf employee candidates are set up to succeed.Be inspired by a video P&amp;G's interns produced themselves about what they shared and learned this summer.P&amp;G's D/eaf and hard of hearing community demonstrates the many facets of diversity and inclusivity and helps us to live out our commitment to our employees, and our commitment to you - our consumers.

Alongside the couple is a new cameo from actress, producer, philanthropist, and entrepreneur La La Anthony. The ""Men Have Skin Too"" series emphasizes diversity and inclusion as interdependent in the creative process. The new chapter follows another recently released spot starring actor Ross Butler.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221006005628/en/Old Spice launches its latest ""Men Have Skin Too"" TV spot with ""Brunch"" taking the drama from behind closed doors into the public when Deon confronts Gabby and her friends at brunch about ""borrowing"" his GentleMan’s Blend Body Wash with Lavender and Mint. (Photo: Old Spice)Since launching in 2019, ""Men Have Skin Too"" elevates deep insights and relatable drama as Deon confidently protects his Old Spice products. The latest spots show the social awkwardness that ensues when a private disagreement becomes public, especially when the concern is his esteemed grooming products. In the spot, Deon marches through a hotel to confront Gabby and her friends, including La La Anthony, at brunch, who used the last of his GentleMan’s Blend Body Wash with Lavender and Mint. Directing the spot is Dime Davis (A Black Lady Sketch Show, Boomerang), who delivers a unique perspective to bring to life this third chapter of Deon and Gabrielle’s characters.Old Spice also introduced another spot called ""Finer Things"" featuring Ross Butler (13 Reasons Why, Riverdale, To All the Boys Always And Forever, Shazam!). The spot leans into ""Men Have Skin Too"" while depicting a more traditional Asian cultural point of view to resonate with Asian audiences. Research shows that two-thirds of Asians think there is not enough representation on TV. In addition, one-half feel that the portrayal of their identity is inaccurate. To embrace Asian American culture, Old Spice partnered with Plan C Agency, an Asian American marketing and communications agency.Story continuesThe spot depicts an involved mother obsessed with her son enjoying the ""finer"" things in life and marriage. The mother attributes Ross’ impossibly smooth skin to his Gentleman’s Blend with Lavender and Mint body wash, which leads her to try it for herself. Ross confronts his wife, who he thinks used the last of his Gentleman’s Blend Body Wash with Lavender and Mint, only to realize it was his mother. The ""Finer Things"" spot was written and directed by Creative Director and filmmaker Clayton Tony Au. Clayton’s work in narrative films and commercials often showcases the uniqueness of the Asian American experience.Off the screen, Old Spice continues to craft science-backed formulas that delight multicultural consumers with products that look and feel superior. We continue to hear from multicultural men that they crave a body wash that not only cleanses but leaves their skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. This insight led Old Spice to formulate Gentleman’s Blend body washes with premium ingredients like petrolatum, the #1 dermatologist-recommended moisturizing ingredient. These ingredients provide all-day moisture to combat dry skin. In addition, the expert blends of light, gender-neutral scents like lavender and mint paired with a rich, creamy lather from a gentle formula create an elevated in-shower experience.The Skin Health Alliance, a global organization of independent dermatologists and skin scientists that assess the research and development behind various products, endorses Old Spice Gentleman’s Blend. With many options available in the market, the Skin Health Alliance supporting the Gentleman’s Blend lineup as safe and effective helps consumers know what’s good for their skin and confidently make the best choice for their skincare needs.""For as long as I can remember, Old Spice body washes and deodorants have been a staple for the men in my family,"" said La La Anthony. ""I am proud to partner with Old Spice for their’ Men Have Skin Too’ campaign and excited to be included in one of their famously funny commercials.""""Working with companies and brands that put diversity and inclusion at the forefront of all that they do is so important to me,"" Anthony continued. ""I am honored to be a part of this campaign that highlights incredible Black talent and culture.""""Bringing together iconic cultural influences with relatable insights makes this campaign something that consumers want to talk about with friends,"" said Matt Krehbiel, Old Spice vice president at Procter &amp; Gamble. ""We combine that approach with ensuring consumers have the best body care products by crafting skincare-inspired formulas that help elevate their self-care regimen.""Men Have Skin Too - The SequelCreated by Wieden + Kennedy (Portland), the campaign launches with ""Brunch"" featuring La La Anthony debuting on national television and the Old Spice YouTube Channel on October 6. The campaign will continue in 2023 with an additional spot also featuring La La Anthony titled ""Family Reunion"" that showcases another hilarious moment of Gabrielle and others ""borrowing"" Deon’s beloved Old Spice.The ""Men Have Skin Too"" universe gets flipped on its head with a ""Men Have Hair Too"" spot titled ""Cold"" that shows Gabrielle hilariously swiping Deon’s Old Spice Moisturizing 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner mid-shower.Fans can follow the integrated campaign across social media at #MenHaveSkinToo and #MenHaveHairToo.Old Spice GentleMan’s Blend LineupFor far too long, men’s grooming products have provided insufficient ingredients and benefits compared to women's products.

387,1b63744f-7fbb-390d-bba6-db757fa80f4c,SLG,2022-10-07,SL Green Need Not Worry About the Work-From-Home Trend,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sl-green-not-worry-home-163236701.html,1665073956.0,STORY,"['SLG', 'SLG-PI']","[SL Green (NYSE:SLG) is one of the biggest real estate companies in New York City, specializing in office spaces. The company has a strong track record of delivering consistent dividend growth, and its share price has held up relatively well during periods of market volatility. In addition, SL Green's portfolio is diversified across many different property types, which helps to mitigate risk. For these reasons, I believe SL Green is an attractive option for investors looking for a haven in the current market conditions.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SLG. Click here to check it out. SLG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLGPeter Lynch Chart of SLGThe biggest concern bears have for this stock is that it primarily deals in office spaces in a major metropolitan area, meaning it has seen demand drop as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the work-from-home trend. Many tenants closed their businesses or moved out of SL Green's properties, and the company's stock price fell sharply.However, things are now changing, with business coming back to the office. The occupancy level in Manhattan, which was 94.3% before the pandemic came about, has now increased to 92% again after a sharp fall-off in 2020. This is a pretty healthy number and signals that the company is on the right track to reaching pre-pandemic levels.SL Green is well-positioned to weather the current economic downturn, as its properties are largely leased to creditworthy tenants with long-term leases. However, the company is not immune to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting work-from-home movement. Even with its successful recovery so far, investors fear that tenants will continue to leave New York City for cheaper office space, leading to depressed occupancy levels and overcapacity in SL Green's portfolio.Thus, the company's stock has been under pressure in recent years due to concerns about the future of the New York office market. However, that also means SL Green could represent a value opportunity at current levels.Story continuesSL Green Need Not Worry About the Work-From-Home TrendWhy the work-from-home trend will not hurt SL GreenThe work-from-home lifestyle has become increasingly popular in recent years, and the pandemic has only accelerated this trend. A growing number of employees are now taking advantage of the flexibility and freedom that work-from-home arrangements offer. For many people, working from home means no more commuting, saving time and money. In addition, working from home often leads to a better balance between work and personal life. With less time spent traveling to and from work, employees have more time to spend with their families or pursue other interests outside of work. Moreover, for some job positions, working from home leads to higher productivity, not only due to a better work-life balance but also due to eliminating the distractions and unnecessary meetings that can plague office environments.The number of people who work remotely is on the rise, and about half of the U.S. office workforce currently believes they can do their job this way per a Gallup report. However, 38% of fully remote employees prefer hybrid jobs where they can still have in-person office experiences.There are many reasons why working from home will never completely replace the need for office space. First, not everyone can work from home. Many jobs, even office jobs, cannot be done from home, and others may require employees to be close to one another in order to succeed in group projects. Even those who can work from home may not always want to because they may want to meet their co-workers in person. Finally, working from home can be isolating, and for some, it is not easy to stay focused without the structure of an office. Many companies require or prefer their employees to work in the office for these reasons. A new Insight Global survey found that nearly 80% of American employees fear remote workers will be the first to go during a recession, so job stability is also a consideration.The return of tourism is a big boonNew York City is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, and the return of tourism is helping to boost the local economy.International tourism showed strong signs of recovery, with arrivals reaching 57% of pre-pandemic levels in the first seven months of this year. The UNWTO World Travel Barometer reported an increase during this time period, too - it almost tripled.According to SL Green, revenues are beginning to rebound as more people visit the city. With international travel restrictions beginning to ease up, more people will likely visit New York City in the coming months. As tourism increases, so too will the city's economic fortunes. With a presence in the New York Metropolitan Area, SL Green will benefit from this development.SL Green possesses impeccable dividend credentialsReal estate investment trusts like SL Green are always a hot topic among investors, and for a good reason. REITS tend to offer high dividends due to being required to pay out 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, making them an attractive option for income-seekers. And of all the real estate investment trusts out there, SL Green is one of my favorites. This REIT is one of the largest office landlords in New York City, and its portfolio includes some of the most iconic buildings in Manhattan. Moreover, SL Green has a proven record of delivering consistent dividends to shareholders.Historically, SL Green paid a dividend distribution every four months. It changed this distribution to monthly in April 2021. The company increased its annual dividend for 11 consecutive years, and its payout is not in danger at this point. Although the payout ratio of 0.87 might seem high, we need to consider that this is a low payout ratio for a real estate investment trust. The main reason for the REIT's success has been that it manages its business well, which is one reason it has raised dividends for 11 consecutive years.TakeawaySL Green's ability to weather the Covid-19 pandemic is a testament to the strength of its portfolio, the quality of its tenants and the enduring demand for office space in the long-term. While the pandemic has created challenges for the company, SL Green emerged from the crisis mostly intact, and I believe the work-from-home trend won't be big enough in the years to come to severely dent the company's earnings. SL Green has high occupancy rates because its properties are located among the most desired parts of New York City. This usually means its dividend is also quite healthy. Additionally, SL Green's stock is down by almost 50% this year on overblown fears, which could present a value opportunity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

UDR, one of the most favorably-positioned multi-family apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States, is set to benefit from its geographically-diverse portfolio with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban markets. Also, technological advancements and process enhancements, and solid balance-sheet strength bode well for the company.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The estimate revision trend for 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has increased nearly 1% upward over the past two months to $2.32.Shares of UDR have lost 10.0% in the past six months compared with the industry's decline of 7.7%. However, given its robust fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead and hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes UDR a Solid Pick?Solid Industry Fundamentals: The company’s properties are located throughout the United States, which includes a mix of urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations. In addition, UDR has a geographically-diverse portfolio with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban markets.Therefore, portfolio diversification with respect to geographies and price points limits UDR’s exposure to volatility and concentration risks alongside assuring stable cash flows.Moreover, a favorable demographic trend in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent, is likely to fuel the demand for UDR’s properties.Technological Advancements &amp; Process Enhancements: UDR’s technological investments and process enhancements are expected to help control future expenses and aid margin expansion and long-term profitability. The company’s Next Generation Operating Platform supports electronical interaction, provides service to residents and aids its business prospects. These efforts are likely to give the company a competitive edge over its peers.FFO Growth: This residential REIT raised its FFO as adjusted per share guidance for 2022. It expects the same to lie in the range of $2.29-$2.33 compared with $2.25-$2.31 guided earlier.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2022 FFO per share implies a rise of 15.42% for 2022 compared with the industry’s average of 12.60% and is currently pegged at $2.32.Balance Sheet Strength: UDR has a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited second-quarter 2022 with $1.3 billion of liquidity and net debt-to-EBITDAre of 6.2X.With a well-laddered debt maturity schedule and investment grade credit ratings of Baa1/Stable from Moody’s and a BBB+/Stable from S&amp;P Global Ratings, UDR has enough financial flexibility to capitalize on growth opportunities.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. In March 2022, the residential REIT hiked its annualized dividend by 4.7% to $1.52 per share, resulting in a quarterly dividend of 38 cents. It has maintained this payment thereafter.UDR has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.57%. Given its robust balance sheet position and a sustainable cash flow from operations, the dividend payment is likely to be sustainable in forthcoming quarters.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks from the residential REIT sector are AvalonBay Communities AVB, Equity Residential EQR and BRT Apartments BRT.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AvalonBay Communities’ current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward in the past month to $9.84.

It takes courage to buy them at these times, but the rewards can be substantial if appreciation occurs, along with the huge dividend yields locked in for the long term.These three well-known real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been out of favor in 2022, and their dividend yields are now well above their five-year averages.Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT that owns and leases shopping malls, restaurants, outlet centers and entertainment venues.Simon Property Group has been a leading retail REIT for decades. Eleven months ago, Simon Property Group was trading at $160. But 2022 has seen a huge sell-off in quality REIT stocks with inflation, interest rate hikes and fears of a recession so predominant. September was particularly rough as Simon Property Group’s stock fell to a low of $86.02. It has since recovered to trade at $95.87.The annual dividend of $7 per share now yields 7.3%, or 25% above its five-year average of 5.84%. For investors looking for a stable long-term REIT with a huge dividend yield going forward, Simon Property Group could be a winner.Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX) is a Paramus, New Jersey-based retail REIT that leases, manages and develops commercial properties in the New York City metropolitan area.The quarterly dividend of $4.50 was raised from $4.25 in 2018 and has remained stable ever since. There were no cuts nor elimination of the dividend during the COVID-19 pandemic.The 52-week range for Alexander’s is $205 to $299.99, and its most recent price was near $213.50.Like Simon Property Group, September was a down month for Alexander’s stock, pushing up the annual dividend of $18 per share to yield 8.43%. With a five-year average yield of 6%, Alexander’s could be a real income bargain at this level.Story continuesVornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is a New York City-based office REIT that owns and manages nearly 26 million square feet of office buildings in the nation’s largest cities, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.Vornado Realty Trust celebrated its 60th year of trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2022, so it’s clearly a well-established company. Yet spiking interest rates and recessionary fears have brought down its price like so many other REITs this year. The 52-week price range for Vornado Realty Trust is $22.83 to $47.26, and the stock touched its low within the past week.Vornado Realty Trust has beaten the analysts’ estimates over the past two quarters, and its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) numbers have been improving. But the market only seems to care about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s next move or two on interest rates.Although the five-year average dividend yield is 4.96%, the present yield on the $2.12 annual dividend is an incredible 8.8%. The quarterly dividend was cut from 66 cents to 53 cents in August 2020 but has remained stable since that time. Income investors could be getting quite a bargain at this price.Related: This Little-Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsToday's Private Market Insights:QC Capital launched its latest real estate fund with a target annualized return of 15% to 19%.

""Scottsdale Fashion Square is already the region's undisputed luxury leader, and the tremendous success of our luxury wing demonstrates the strong appetite among retailers and shoppers for even more high-end experiences throughout this top-performing property.

Scottsdale Fashion Square will extend its luxury presentation beyond the luxury wing itself, creating a striking arrival point, complete with luxury valet service, at the property's most active entrance. Also planned for this phase are two-story storefronts and exterior-facing retail buildings at the south entrance, and a porte cochere that will incorporate up to five destination restaurants.Echoing the aesthetics of the luxury wing, interior renovation elements for the south wing include upscale new finishes, new natural stone flooring, three spectacular custom light fixtures and recessed LED lighting, elegant furnishings, better sightlines to highlight individual retailers and more. Everything will come together to deliver a more cohesive and holistic luxury experience for guests and retailers throughout the property.By every measure, the luxury wing that debuted at Scottsdale Fashion Square in November 2018 has been a tremendous success, attracting an enviable collection of new-to-market, pure luxury retailers and restaurants including Dior, Saint Laurent and Nobu and spurring top luxury brands already at the property – from Louis Vuitton, St. John, Jimmy Choo, Bottega Veneta and many others – to recommit, expand and renovate their stores.""Scottsdale Fashion Square is the very definition of luxury retail in the Southwest, with nearly 50 of the finest luxury and contemporary brands including Cartier, Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, Christian Louboutin, Bulgari and Prada, alongside our top-performing Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom department stores,"" said Michael Guerin, Executive Vice President, Macerich. ""Continually curating our merchandise mix with dynamic new experiences, including additional new restaurants and great design elements, to other parts of the property beyond the luxury wing enhances the value proposition of Scottsdale Fashion Square as whole for retailers and brands, while optimizing the customer journey for our guests.""Scottsdale Fashion Square is one of the nation's premier shopping destinations, with 1.9 million square feet and more than 240 shops and restaurants, plus a growing variety of exciting new uses including wellness + fitness and a hotel, both now under construction.

391,4b132775-995f-3cb0-99d6-914c4ea28c56,MAC,2022-10-07,Lock In High Dividend Yields Before These 3 REITs See A Major Price Jump,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lock-high-dividend-yields-3-152117354.html,1665069677,STORY,"['UNIT', 'MAC', 'SKT']","[When choosing among stocks in the same sector, investors often compare fundamentals like price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) or earnings per share (EPS), balance sheets and other metrics.But it’s also important for investors to compare the relative strength of a stock versus its peers in that sector. In other words, investors also want to consider the stocks that are recently outperforming other similar stocks, because these are the stocks that institutions are buying and will usually continue to perform well.This past week saw a two-day rally to begin October after a prolonged slump for real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks in September. Using the parameters of REITs priced at $7 or higher and with a minimum 3.5% dividend yield, here are three REITs that fared the best over the five-day period from Sept. 28 through Oct. 4.Although some rough times could still be ahead, investors may want to consider locking in these high-dividend yields before these REITs see a major price jump.Macerich Co. (NYSE: MAC) is a Santa Monica, California-based retail REIT that specializes in the acquisition, leasing and management of malls. It operates 44 regional malls all across the U.S.The 52-week price range is $7.40 to $22.88. From Sept. 28 through Oct. 4, Macerich was up 6.87%, perhaps an indication of more appreciation to follow.The annual dividend of 60 cents per share yields 7.1%. Macerich cut its dividend drastically in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold but has paid a consistent quarterly dividend of 15 cents since then. The funds from operation (FFO) of $1.63 is more than sufficient for the payout, and there is plenty of room for dividend growth.Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ: UNIT) is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics. Uniti Group owns and operates 129,000 fiber route miles covering 270,000 buildings in the U.S.Uniti Group’s 52-week price range was $6.66 to $14.60, with the low coming during the last week of September. However, in the recent five-day period, Uniti rebounded strongly to move higher by 10.9%.Story continuesThe 60-cent annual dividend has grown 150% over the past five years, and with the 45% sell-off in the stock price since March, the yield has now grown to 8.2%. It seems as if traders are trying to put in a bottom on Uniti Group stock, and better times may be ahead for this REIT.Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. (NYSE: SKT) is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based REIT that owns and manages 38 open-air upscale outlet malls across 20 states and in Canada. It leases to over 500 well-known companies, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Coach New York, Vera Bradley Designs Inc. and Kate Spade New York.Tanger Factory Outlet Centers cut its dividend from $0.358 to $0.178 in January 2021 but has since raised the dividend twice. Its 80-cent annual dividend now yields 5.4%. The FFO is $1.47 per share, so there is plenty of room for future dividend raises.The 52-week range is $13.26 to $22.51, with the stock touching its low only a week ago. However, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers was up a solid 7.28% during the recent five-day period and could be poised for a solid rebound after losing 32% since last November.Read next: This Little-Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsToday's Private Market Insights:RAD Diversified's RAD REIT has declared an 8% dividend yield.

Robinson CHRW, Ford Motor Co. F and DISH Network Corp. DISH.5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Watch Despite Market MayhemMounting inflation in the United States is a key concern, implying that market volatility is still rampant. To tame the red-hot inflation, the Fed has hiked interest rates 300 basis points so far this year.  The central bank further vowed to raise interest rates to drag down inflation to its 2% target at best by 2025. Soaring interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will persistently affect consumer spending. In fact, the Fed also warned of economic hardship going forward.Rising energy and food prices apart, supply-chain disruptions and the resultant supply-demand imbalance are aggravating the stock market volatility. This uncertainty caused the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — to shed 8.8%, 9.3% and 10.5% of their value, respectively, in September.However, this gloomy scenario does not mean that investors should dodge stocks. In fact, broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines, CVR Energy, C.H. Robinson, Ford Motor Co. and DISH Network Corp. are worth keeping on one's radar for healthy returns despite this market bloodbath.Why Broker Advice is the Need of the HourBrokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), embark on thorough research of the stocks under their coverage. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers indulge in extensive research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise.Therefore, the brokers' opinion can be a valuable guide for investors. Thus, adhering to brokers' well-researched information is of paramount importance, particularly in uncertain times such as the present scenario. This is because it is next to impossible for individual investors to keep track of the market nuances amid such economic upheavals and design a winning basket of stocks.Story continuesOne of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns, irrespective of the market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and raise estimates. Naturally, adding such stocks to one's portfolio amid an unpredictable situation might prove to be a winning strategy.To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving broker recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Do Not Ignore the Top LineHowever, designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to lead to a winning approach. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance.

404,63549167-f196-3463-8349-e5e2f02b4779,AFL,2022-10-07,Aflac (AFL) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-upgraded-buy-does-160004696.html,1665072004,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac (AFL) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Aflac basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Aflac imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for AflacThis insurer is expected to earn $5.37 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.6%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aflac. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Aflac to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

407,87fb696d-9ad6-3924-89bc-cc240bf8d640,FCX,2022-10-07,The 7 Best Stocks to Buy on a Dip,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-dip-170148517.html,1664879928,STORY,"['GE', 'AMZN', 'RIVN', 'SDGR', 'FCX', 'BNGO']","[Investors looking for the best stocks to buy on a dip have plenty of options, depending on how they think of the term “dip.”The dip can suggest a market dominator that is trading near its low, or it can be a stock that has bounced recently following an extended downtrend. The best stocks to buy on a dip could even be those that have defied the broader market to deliver a stellar performance in 2022. In the latter case, even a modest pullback may offer a chance to purchase shares at a slight discount before the next leg up.Today’s list of the best stocks to buy on a dip has examples of all of these. Whether trading at a steep discount or taking a momentary breather, these stocks all have the potential to deliver outsized short- and long-term profits for investors who are ready to move some cash off the sidelines and buy the dip now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAMZNAmazon$91.87CPRXCatalyst Pharmaceuticals$16.73SPOTSpotify$76.22TANInvesco Solar ETF$80.55SPWRSunPower$23.91PLUGPlug Power$15.08INMDInMode$35.51Amazon (AMZN)Logistics activity on the Amazon (AMZN) site of Vélizy-Villacoublay in France. Packages are sorted by workers on conveyors.Source: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.comTo say investors were disappointed with tech giant Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) third-quarter results is an understatement. Shares are down more than 10% since the Oct. 27 announcement.Among investor qualms were lower-than-expected Q3 revenue, slowing cloud growth and an underwhelming forecast for the holiday quarter.Even the online retail and cloud services giant is feeling the sting of inflation. On the bright side, energy prices have come down meaningfully from their peak and there are signs that inflation is easing. While this helped boost stocks since October, Amazon has not been a beneficiary of the broader market rally.Yet, if the market continues higher in the short term based on continued economic optimism, AMZN stock should eventually move higher with it, especially if the company ends up beating its conservative Q4 guidance. Of course, in the long term, investors will likely look back on today’s price levels as a screaming deal in the stock.Story continuesCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPRX), which develops drugs for rare diseases, is a buy-the-dip candidate that has bucked the broader market downtrend, with shares jumping 140% so far in 2022.Catalyst’s outperformance this year is largely due to the company’s strong financial results, which indicate rapid uptake of its drug, Firdapse.The Food and Drug Administration approved Firdapse in 2018 for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, which affects around 3,000 people in the U.S., including 1,400 adults who are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.Firdapse remains the only approved treatment in this rare disease market, and patients tend to stay on the medication once they start taking it.In the third quarter, the company reported revenue of $57.2 million, up 59% from a year ago. Strong Firdapse sales also helped the company beat analysts’ earnings estimates by a wide margin, reporting 26 cents per share versus their average 19-cent estimate.For the full year, analysts are expecting earnings to jump more than 45% to $210 million and EPS to surge nearly 100% to 73 cents. In 2023, they are calling for revenue growth of 18% to $248 million and earnings growth of 20% to 73 cents per share.CPRX stock is trading at 19.5 times next year’s earnings estimate, a very low valuation for a successful drugmaker. Expect shares to continue higher as the company captures more of the Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome patient market and expands its rare disease portfolio.SpotifySpotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.comDespite the generally dreary U.S. ad market, Spotify (SPOT), is growing impressively.Despite high inflation and poor ad market trends, SPOT delivered positive free cash flow of 40 million euros last quarter.Spotify’s average revenue per user last quarter was only 0.53 euros. In the longer term, I believe that the company will find ways of generating even better results.SPOT stock is down 28% in the last three months and 67% in 2022, bringing its forward price-sales ratio to a very low level of slightly over one ($14.82 billion market cap/.average 2023 rev estimate of 14.13 billion euros or $14.65 billion).Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.Source: ShutterstockThe Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), a proxy for the solar energy industry, has taken investors on a wild ride in 2022.Shares peaked in mid-August, following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions in clean energy incentives. However, the stock has given a chunk of that back, trading closer to $80 today.It appears that the retreat is based on two main fears. The concern that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will hurt the American solar industry next year and that higher interest rates will hurt rooftop solar demand in the U.S.As I’ve stated in the past, given the tremendously pro-solar sentiment of the Biden administration, I do not expect it to enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in a way that will significantly damage the solar sector.Further, many companies whose stocks are owned by TAN such as GCL-Poly Energy Holdings and Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ) generate much more of their revenue from outside of America than within it.Finally, the rooftop sector does not represent a majority of the U.S. solar industry.SunPower (SPWR)a phone with the sunpower logo in front of a U.S. flagSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) provides solar panels globally. Shares reversed lower in September and now sit below their September high. But they’ve also rallied 26% in the last month.The company should get a big boost from the EU’s upcoming mandate of solar panels on all new homes and buildings starting in 2030. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, which will implement 30% tax credits for all residential solar installations for the next decade, will give rooftop solar a big lift.As I mentioned earlier, I believe concerns about higher interest rates hurting solar panel demand are overdone. The balance sheets of American households remain quite strong, according to Fitch Ratings. The firm called U.S. consumer finances “robust,” noting, “Household debt service and leverage continue to be relatively low compared with historical standards.”Meanwhile, in the U.S. and even more so in Europe, electricity prices have risen sharply, greatly increasing consumers’ financial incentives to install rooftop solar panels. SPWR and its competitors should benefit meaningfully from this trend.Plug Power  (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems, is down 47% so far this year.Shares have not yet shown signs of putting in a bottom, making this one of the riskier of today’s best stocks to buy on a dip. However, the industry has huge growth potential and the company’s annual business update, scheduled for Jan. 4, 2023, could provide an upside catalyst for the stock.Between 2021 and 2031, the global green hydrogen market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 46.5% to $31.6 billion. And recent industry deals show the sector is indeed heating up.For instance, in August, Plug said it struck a deal to provide 10,950 tons of liquified hydrogen per year to Amazon. The online retail giant, which already uses Plug Power’s fuel cells to power its electric forklifts, plans to use liquified hydrogen to fuel transportation and building operations beginning in 2025.Morgan Stanley believes Plug Power “will be a leader in the green hydrogen ecosystem.” The firm rates shares “overweight” with a $48 price target. That implies an upside potential of more than 200% from current levels.InMode (INMD)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comInMode (NASDAQ:INMD), a maker of radiofrequency-based medical products used in cosmetic procedures, delivered beat-and-raise Q3 results on Oct. 27.Shares initially popped following the announcement but have since fallen 8% from their post-earnings peak.On Oct. 12, before InMode reported its Q3 results, investment bank Jefferies initiated coverage of the name with a “buy” rating and a $40 price target. The analyst said “continued market growth, higher outside the U.S. penetration, share gains and pipeline contributions” should help InMode exceed analyst expectations.With a forward price-earnings ratio of just 13.8, put INMD on your list of the best stocks to buy on a dip.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PLUG and INMD.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

The Value Investor Podcast first launched in July 2016. It's been over 6 years of episodes and we've finally reached the magical 300th episode. Thanks to everyone for listing through the ups and downs of the last few years.And thanks to the new listeners who have found the Value Investor Podcast in 2022 because value stocks are back in vogue.It's a good time to be a value investor.Buffett's Investing Advice in 2008However, 2022 has been rough for investors, whether in value or growth stocks. That's why it always pays to consult with the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, for advice on what to do during a big stock market sell-off.And what was a bigger sell-off than the stock market in 2008 during the financial crisis?Buffett took pen to paper on Oct 16, 2008 and published an op-ed in the New York Times called: Buy American. I am. You can read it here.He said about 2008, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""Buffett also warned that earnings could take a hit as businesses suffered through tough economic times but that he believed most companies would be setting new profit records 5, 10 or 20 years down the line.Story continuesSound familiar?Stay the CourseBuffett also advised that there will be dark times and that's when investors should be buying. He said that in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was while inflation raged and the economy was in the tank.The stock market has a habit of rebounding well before a recession ends. Wall Street tends to ""price in"" all the bad news months ahead of time.That's why it's so difficult to try and time the bottom. Buffett said in 2008 he wasn't going to try and time it for the short-term, as he had a long-term investing horizon.That's good advice.5 Cheap Stocks That Pay Dividends1.       ExxonMobil XOMYou don't have to reinvent the wheel. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been buying Chevron this year but ExxonMobil is also cheap.Shares of ExxonMobil are up big in 2022 thanks to rising oil and natural gas prices. It's jumped 62% year-to-date.But ExxonMobil has a forward P/E of just 7.4 and a PEG ratio of just 0.3. A PEG ratio under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.Should ExxonMobil be on your short list?2.       Pfizer PFETracey keeps turning back to Pfizer on the podcast because it remains dirt cheap.Shares of Pfizer have fallen 25% year-to-date, creating a buying opportunity. It now trades with a forward P/E of just 6.8.Pfizer also pays a juicy dividend, yielding 3.6%.Are you waiting to see if Pfizer will get even cheaper?3.       Union Pacific UNPUnion Pacific has been around since the 1860s. This railroad has made it through wars, the Great Depression, assassinations, the Great Recession and it is still growing its business.Shares of Union Pacific have fallen 20% year-to-date. It's not as cheap as some of the other stocks, however, with a forward P/E of 17.7.It's still paying a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.Should the rails be on your short list?4.       Cisco CSCOCisco was one of the tech titans of the 1990s, returning over 10,000% in that decade. But it has never repeated that performance after the dot-com bust.Cisco shares are down 33.7% year-to-date and are now cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 11.8.In the 1990s, Cisco didn't pay a dividend, but it does now, and it's yielding a juicy 3.6%.Should Cisco be the tech company on your short list?5.       PNC Financial PNCPNC Financial is a large regional bank headquartered in Pittsburgh. Bank earnings should benefit from the Fed raising interest rates.But shares of PNC Financial have also fallen this year, losing 20.5% year-to-date. They're cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.1 and a P/B ratio of 1.38.PNC Financial also pays a juicy dividend, currently yielding 3.7%.Is this a buying opportunity in PNC Financial?What Else Should You Know About Lessons from the 2008 Sell-Off?     Tune into this week's podcast to find out.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.03%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.15%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.27%.Coming into today, shares of the railroad had lost 12.31% in the past month. In that same time, the Transportation sector lost 8.37%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.51%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Union Pacific as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 20, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Union Pacific to post earnings of $3.07 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 19.46%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.47 billion, up 16.18% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.58 per share and revenue of $25 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.38% and +14.68%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Union Pacific. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

That’s why it always pays to consult with the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, for advice on what to do during a big stock market sell-off.And what was a bigger sell-off than the stock market in 2008 during the financial crisis?Buffett took pen to paper on Oct 16, 2008 and published an op-ed in the New York Times called: Buy American. I am. You can read it here.He said about 2008, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.”Buffett also warned that earnings could take a hit as businesses suffered through tough economic times but that he believed most companies would be setting new profit records 5, 10 or 20 years down the line.Sound familiar?Stay the CourseBuffett also advised that there will be dark times and that’s when investors should be buying. He said that in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was while inflation raged and the economy was in the tank.The stock market has a habit of rebounding well before a recession ends. Wall Street tends to “price in” all the bad news months ahead of time.Story continuesThat’s why it’s so difficult to try and time the bottom. Buffett said in 2008 he wasn’t going to try and time it for the short-term, as he had a long-term investing horizon.That’s good advice.5 Cheap Stocks That Pay Dividends1.       ExxonMobil XOMYou don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

The locomotives will be built at Union Pacific's North Little Rock, Arkansas, facility with the first prototype expected to be delivered in late 2023 and five additional units arriving in 2024.Union Pacific. (PRNewsFoto/Union Pacific) (PRNewsfoto/Union Pacific)The locomotives work much like today's plug-in hybrid car, capable of operating in multiple modes with several ways to charge the locomotive batteries including wayside and onboard charging.""Adding hybrid-electric locomotives to our fleet is another important step for Union Pacific as we work to explore 'drop-in' technologies that modify current systems and reduce our carbon footprint"", said Union Pacific's Senior Vice President of Engineering and Mechanical Shane Keller. ""This pilot will help make our fleet more fuel efficient and further advance our commitment to reaching our sustainability goals, while testing the technology's capability for expanded use across our locomotive fleet.""Known as ""mother-slug"" sets, two locomotives are replaced with one diesel locomotive connected to an accessory or slug. In keeping with its sustainability commitments, Union Pacific converts older locomotives, typically with higher emissions. The slug unit will be converted and equipped with batteries, power electronics and controls supplied by ZTR. This helps achieve fuel and maintenance savings and offers environmental benefits allowing the hybrid-electric ""mother-slug"" to operate in single engine, battery charging or electric only modes.As the new locomotives will be used chiefly for yard operations, the engineless slug increases traction motors available to the locomotive, boosting the pulling and braking power that is key for this kind of work.""ZTR is proud of our long-standing relationship with Union Pacific and excited to partner with them on this hybrid-electric locomotive development,"" said ZTR Control Systems President Derek Shipley. ""This investment aligns well with our ongoing goal to leverage ZTR's technical expertise to support railways in their decarbonization and efficiency improvement efforts. This initial hybrid-electric mother-slug application will be the basis of our design for future hybrid-electric, long-haul and fully electric solutions.""Story continuesUnion Pacific began rolling out ""mother-slug"" sets with ZTR's Nexsys control systems in 2017 and currently operates more than 65 in yards systemwide. Depending on the mode of operation, fuel savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions could total up to 80%.Railroads already are one of the most fuel-efficient means of transportation. Moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces GHG emissions by up to 75%. On average, Union Pacific moves a ton of freight 463 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel.Union Pacific published its first comprehensive Climate Action Plan in December 2021, outlining its efforts to significantly reduce emissions within its operations. As part of that commitment, Union Pacific will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 26% by 2030 and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Earlier this year, Union Pacific announced a historic agreement with Wabtec Corporation for 600 locomotive modernizations, the largest investment in modernized locomotives in rail industry history valued at more than $1 billion, as well as the purchase of the world's largest carrier-owned battery-electric locomotive fleet.ABOUT UNION PACIFICUnion Pacific (NYSE: UNP) delivers the goods families and businesses use every day with safe, reliable and efficient service. Operating in 23 western states, the company connects its customers and communities to the global economy.

421,05208858-d8ec-3c29-acb8-4480bdee2a37,DGX,2022-10-07,UPDATE 1-Legal cannabis poses a quandary for US companies screening staff for drugs,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-legal-cannabis-poses-quandary-200822177.html,1665086902,STORY,['DGX'],"[(Updates with Biden executive action)By Timothy AeppelOct 6 (Reuters) - Workers at Wyatt Bassett's furniture factory in Virginia use powerful tools to churn out the company's trademark dressers and headboards, so screening new hires for drugs is a no-brainer.Or it used to be.Virginia last year fully legalized marijuana — the first state in the South to do so. The upshot is that ""being positive for cannabis does not necessarily disqualify you for employment,"" said Bassett, CEO of Vaughan-Bassett Furniture Co., which has 575 employees.On Thursday, President Joe Biden issuedan executive orderaimed at reshaping how the federal government treats cannabis.The shift in policy should aid many companies. Faced with a shortfall in applicants, employers across the U.S. are balancing pressure to ease up on testing for a legal drug with concerns that this could impact safety and raise issues of liability.The U.S. jobless rate ticked up to 3.7% last month, but it remains near a five-decade low.""With the war for talent and the labor shortage, especially in some lower paying jobs, it's tough to find and retain folks — so many are deciding to not test, except for safety sensitive jobs,"" said Julie Schweber, a senior knowledge adviser at the Society for Human Resource Management. Companies with multiple operations in different parts of the country face an added challenge, she said, because laws differ from state to state.Biden's order on Thursday grants a pardon for all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. He also announced a review of how cannabis is ""scheduled,"" or classified, under federal law. The current schedule places it in the same class as heroin and LSD and in a higher classification than fentanyl and methamphetamine.The challenge of balancing workplace safety and the growing prevalence — and legalization — of some types of drugs is especially acute for manufacturers and others who use dangerous equipment.Story continuesLast June, Amazon.com Inc. said positive tests for marijuana use would no longer disqualify people from jobs that are not regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, such as truck drivers.The e-commerce giant — like many other employers — said it will treat cannabis like alcohol, even though traces of its use linger in the human body far longer and can show up on some types of tests after a worker is no longer impaired by its use. ""We will continue to do impairment checks on the job and will test for all drugs and alcohol after any incident,"" wrote former-CEO Dave Clark, in a blog post at the time of the announcement.Data from Quest Diagnostics, which handles testing for companies, shows a steady increase in positivity rates for marijuana tests over the past decade — coinciding with the wave of legalization. In 2012, only 1.9% of workers not subject to federally mandated drug testing requirements failed a pre-employment screening. Last year, that had grown to 4.1%. The jump in positive tests after accidents grew even more during that period, up from 2.4% to 6.7%.The majority of Fortune 1000 companies have some type of screening in place, but many companies are dropping cannabis tests from the list, said Barry Sample, a senior science consultant who compiles Quest's data. Still, Quest estimates between 30 to 35 million employment-related drug tests are conducted in the U.S. annually.Most of the tests Quest conducts use urine samples. Other tests rely on swabbing saliva or hair samples. ""None of this testing can say whether someone is impaired,"" said Sample. Rather, the tests will simply indicate the presence of the drug based on a pre-set threshold.Cannabis use for medical reasons is now legal in 37 states, while recreational use is legal in 19. Quest's data also shows that states that allow recreational use of cannabis have higher positivity rates.Sample said many employers are shifting screening efforts to focus on drugs that remain illegal and where use in some industries also appears on the upswing. In manufacturing, for instance, Quest found the positivity rate clicked up last year for both methamphetamine and cocaine.Insurance experts say it is too early to see if the changes will drive up insurance rates for companies that drop testing. ""Nobody is going to come out and say, 'We're increasing premiums because you have more stoned workers on the job,'"" said Mark Pew, a consultant who specializes in workers' compensation insurance in Georgia. But if, over time, companies that have looser drug screening policies have higher accident rates than those who stick to tougher rules, that could change, he said.Matt Zender, a senior vice president for workers' compensation strategy with AmTrust Financial Services Inc., said one factor that may obscure or offset the impact of more drug use on the job is the general move toward safer workplaces.""If you just look at claims per 100 hours of work, overall people are getting injured less often than they were in the past,"" he said.Meanwhile, companies continue to fine tune their approaches on the issue. A California manufacturer of plastic bags, contacted by Reuters about their drug screening policies, was surprised to learn that his human resources department was automatically rejecting applicants who test positive for cannabis.""My nephew would never get a job if I enforced that on him,"" Kevin Kelly, CEO of Emerald Packaging Inc. in Union City, Calif., said in an email. He said he had now directed his hiring managers to drop the requirement, adding that workers at the factory are not allowed to be impaired on the job. Cannabis use is fully legal in California.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.03% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the seller of routers, switches, software and services had lost 6.73% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.49% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.51% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cisco Systems as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Cisco Systems is projected to report earnings of $0.84 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 2.44%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.31 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.53 per share and revenue of $54.07 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.06% and +4.87%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Cisco Systems.

The Value Investor Podcast first launched in July 2016. It’s been over 6 years of episodes and we’ve finally reached the magical 300th episode. Thanks to everyone for listing through the ups and downs of the last few years.And thanks to the new listeners who have found the Value Investor Podcast in 2022 because value stocks are back in vogue.It’s a good time to be a value investor.Buffett’s Investing Advice in 2008However, 2022 has been rough for investors, whether in value or growth stocks. That’s why it always pays to consult with the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, for advice on what to do during a big stock market sell-off.And what was a bigger sell-off than the stock market in 2008 during the financial crisis?Buffett took pen to paper on Oct 16, 2008 and published an op-ed in the New York Times called: Buy American. I am. You can read it here.He said about 2008, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.”Buffett also warned that earnings could take a hit as businesses suffered through tough economic times but that he believed most companies would be setting new profit records 5, 10 or 20 years down the line.Sound familiar?Stay the CourseBuffett also advised that there will be dark times and that’s when investors should be buying. He said that in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was while inflation raged and the economy was in the tank.The stock market has a habit of rebounding well before a recession ends. Wall Street tends to “price in” all the bad news months ahead of time.Story continuesThat’s why it’s so difficult to try and time the bottom. Buffett said in 2008 he wasn’t going to try and time it for the short-term, as he had a long-term investing horizon.That’s good advice.5 Cheap Stocks That Pay Dividends1.       ExxonMobil XOMYou don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

426,ba402d34-d106-342a-b687-a50743009110,CSCO,2022-10-07,Salveo Innovations: How an mHealth Application Gives Patients a Greater Sense of Self-Agency,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salveo-innovations-mhealth-application-gives-133500404.html,1665063300,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 6, 2022 / Now that the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 winners have been officially announced, you'll want to learn more about each winning team and the story behind each innovation. The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.This year, Cisco offered a special HBCU Startup Prize to a team with a founder who is a student or graduate of one of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and who presents an innovative technology solution that addresses a social or environmental problem. This $50,000 USD prize supports our $150 million commitment to the strategic recovery, sustainability, and legacy of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.This year's HBCU Startup Prize winners come from two distinguished HBCUs - co-founders Kesha Lee attended Dillard University, and Carlisha Gentles, PharmD, BCPS, attended Howard University. Their united mission at Salveo Innovations is to improve health literacy and patient-provider relationships through an easy-to-use, patient-centered application solution. I sat down with co-founder Carlisha Gentles to discuss beginnings, inspirations, and how this award will impact Salveo Innovations.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Carlisha: Low health literacy is one of the top crises threatening the healthcare of our nation. Over a million people in the U.S. have low health literacy. Communities of color are more impacted than others, but you can see it amongst all races and all socio-economic statuses. Even some individuals with higher level degrees can have difficulty breaking down complex health information when it's presented to them.Story continuesSo that's our mission. We're trying to ensure that everyone can take health information that's presented to them, utilize it, and understand it. And once they've been given clear instructions by their doctor or other healthcare provider, they can take actionable steps to have the best possible health care outcomes.Can you explain how the solution works?Carlisha: What we've heard often in the community is that many people don't know what to ask their providers or I don't feel comfortable asking them questions. Our core product, which we affectionately named ‘Tyrone,' is an application in development that's culturally responsive, culturally sensitive, and community driven. It helps patients navigate their healthcare encounters with their providers by giving them critical information when they need it most.The solution helps patients navigate the level of care they will need based upon their symptoms and other patient information provided. It also helps them prepare for the appointment. And then post-appointment, this solution delivers feedback, post-care instructions, lab results, and prescription nudges. It also provides prescribers' discharge notes or summaries, filled out through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). And the more the patient uses the application, the better the application (and ML) learns how they communicate - so the solution improves the more the patient uses it.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Carlisha: Many establishing medical documents are written at an eighth grade reading comprehension level. But even when health information is available at an eighth grade reading level, many of our most vulnerable communities are only at a third grade reading comprehension level.So that's the added component of our innovative solution - incorporating ML and AI, so that we're able to break that information down further for the patient to understand. So any patient using the application can say, ‘my doctor said that I have diabetes, Tyrone. I don't understand what he said. Can you explain this further for me?' And the patient can then have an understandable health information exchange.What inspired you to develop this solution?Carlisha: Kesha and I were both born and raised in urban areas in the south. She grew up in Alabama and I'm from Georgia. Growing up in Georgia, I personally saw systemic structural racism from an education and healthcare system perspective. And my co-founder Kesha often remembers accompanying her grandmother to the hospital whenever she needed a doctor. The vestiges of the Tuskegee experiment were ever-present, and her grandmother didn't trust the healthcare system.With Tyrone, we envision a world where no one has communication barriers when interacting with their healthcare system, when everyone can utilize their provided health information to make better decisions. Not only for them, but for their families as well. And this is a world that we're building with Tyrone. We want to give people a greater sense of self-agency.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Carlisha: It's going to be transformative for our business and development of Tyrone. Just getting that big stamp of approval, like, ‘hey, we see you. We appreciate what you're doing. We get it.' Every interaction with Cisco's teams - helping us, guiding us, preparing us - has been amazing and helped to elevate not just us, but all the Global Problem Solver participants - which I think is phenomenal.I sum it all up with this quote: ‘We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community. Ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others for their sakes and for our own.'Do you know what you will use the prize money for specifically?Carlisha: We've already mapped it out. We are contracting with a UI/UX and app developer to scale the current version of Tyrone from clickable prototype to an actual full beta version. This will allow us to begin user testing and launch our MVP for Q4. We also intend to hire at least one or two paid interns. We're dedicated to supporting HBCU student talent during each phase of our growth. Finally, we have plans to host a community pilot.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Carlisha: Take your time, but hurry. Time is of the essence but going fast without focusing on your offering, value proposition, and the community, you are designing for will lead to more challenges down the line. Building agile systems will be an asset in the short, near, and long-term.Listen deeply and trust your instincts. It can be incredibly difficult to walk away from funding, considering the current landscape for entrepreneurs, and especially considering the challenges we as women and minority founders face. However, remember that ‘No' is a complete sentence. We've encountered many predatory programs and lending vehicles that have been incredibly discouraging. Hold steady to your integrity, use the experience to learn/gain additional insight, and walk away when things don't feel right.Finally, embrace partnerships and seek counsel. Not everyone will get your vision, but work hard to build a team of support grounded in authentic and trusting relationships. One of the things that all entrepreneurs must do is learn how to cede power and trust the gifts of your team. Our success is very much a team effort and we're incredibly grateful to our operations expert, Natasha Ettienne-Johnson, and strategic advisor, Kornelius Bankston of TechPlug. They've been with us from the beginning, helping us to build systems, partnerships, and plan long-term. So, we'd advise any social entrepreneur to identify your key experts, trust the talents, and expertise they bring to the table and then get out of their way.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719316/Salveo-Innovations-How-an-mHealth-Application-Gives-Patients-a-Greater-Sense-of-Self-Agency]"
