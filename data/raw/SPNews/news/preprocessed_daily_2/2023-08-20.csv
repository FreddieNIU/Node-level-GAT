However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Texas Instruments'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:48% = US$7.7b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.48 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 48% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Texas Instruments has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Texas Instruments' moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 31% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TXN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Texas Instruments Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Texas Instruments has a three-year median payout ratio of 53% (which means it retains 47% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Besides, Texas Instruments has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 61% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 43%.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Texas Instruments has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Thieves are going straight to the source.Inventory shrinkage — the loss of items to retail theft, organized crime, damage, vendor fraud, and other factors — is still a major headache for US retailers. At least, that was a common thread heard on recent earnings calls from Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and other large retailers last week.On Wednesday, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer is up against ""an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime."" Last November, Target CFO Michael Fiddelke said the disappearance of merchandise caused a $400 million hit to the retailer's gross profit margin for the year.""Shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time,"" Cornell said in the company's Q2 earnings call.Walmart US CEO John Furner echoed that sentiment, saying: ""Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country.""Retail theft weighed profit margins too. Just ask Home Depot.""In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the earnings call. ""Shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years. It's something we're tackling every day.""Retailers 'not crying wolf'According to the National Retail Federation's (NRF) National Retail Security Survey, retail shrink was a nearly $100 billion problem for the industry as of 2021, the last year data was collected. That cost more than doubled from $45.2 billion in 2015.""I can tell you that never before have I seen what I'm seeing today,"" David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations, told Yahoo Finance. ""The retailers are not crying wolf. They are highlighting a major issue out there.""Story continuesIt's not just shoplifting — organized retail crime and employee theft have become growing concerns, according to the NRF.Violence is a bigger issue too: According to Cornell, Target stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence in the first five months of 2023.""The threat really starts from the point that it leaves the warehouse all the way till it gets to the retail store,"" Marty Andrews, VF Corporation (VFC) vice president of loss prevention, told Yahoo Finance.A security guard, right, stands at the entrance to a Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021, where a recent smash-and-grab robbery took place. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)And ""successful outcomes for the thieves"" are only making matters worse, Marq Claxton, director of political affairs and public relations at the Black Law Enforcement Alliance and a former NYPD officer, told Yahoo Finance. Claxton warned that thieves are ""becoming more violent, more aggressive, more frequent with more people.""The issue gained more attention last weekend after thieves got away with roughly $300,000 in merchandise after a ""flash rob"" at a Nordstrom (JWN) in California.""They're in a position now where these types of flash robberies, these smash-and-grabs — or they've been called 'mobberies' — are very lucrative and very successful for them,"" Claxton said. ""So until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these types of activities.""Locked-up merchandise 'a fine line'The problem is a double-edged sword for retailers and consumers alike.More retailers have locked up higher-ticket items behind plexiglass and installed cameras and other security systems, but these measures come with trade-offs.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company prefers to ""never lock anything up"" as it's bad for business and interferes with customer engagement.""That impacts that consumer interaction,"" Andrews said. ""That's why people are going to retail stores, they want to be around the merchandise, they want to touch it, they want to have those interactions, so it's a fine line of how do you get that great consumer experience, but how do you protect your product?""Leo Pichardo, a store associate at Gristedes supermarket, retrieves a container of Tide laundry soap from a cabinet that has been locked due to retail theft on Tuesday Jan. 31, 2023, at the store in New York. (Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Some feel the extra precautions are necessary, however.While locked-up merchandise may be inconvenient, ""think of the opposite when the mother of a newborn tries to go get formula and the merchandise isn't there because it was just shelf-swept,"" NRF's Johnston said.Walmart's McMillon said that some jurisdictions need to take more action on retail-related crime as companies focus on the aspects of shrink they can control.For instance, the rising use of self-checkout has gained attention as a source of inventory loss. Some studies and reports have documented customers not paying for items in self-checkout transactions or swapping price tags for lower-priced goods when scanning higher-ticket items.But the extent of self-checkout theft is not widely understood. In a call with investors in May, Costco (COST) CEO Richard Galanti said inventory shrink ""fluctuated ... 3 basis points up, really before COVID, as we rolled out self-checkout, and since then, it's come back down a little bit.""At its annual meeting in June, McMillon said lower inventory helps since shrink is correlated with higher inventory levels. The retailer brought inventory growth down by 5.54% year over year.But ultimately, it's all hands on deck to curb theft.""What we're seeing today requires the government, the community, the retailer, everyone, ... including the consumer, to take action,"" Johnston said.Per the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), more than a dozen state attorneys general have launched organized retail crime task forces to coordinate investigations between retailers and prosecutors.Back in June 2023, Congress also passed a law that tasks the FTC with implementing new baseline requirements for online marketplaces to collect, verify, and disclose some information about high-volume third-party sellers — those with 200 or ""more separate sales or transactions of new or unused consumer products and $5,000 or more in gross revenues"" in any continuous 12-month period during the past 24 months.The platforms on watch range from small platforms to big-name online marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart, where stolen goods can be resold.Carl Settlemyer, an attorney in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said ""it's sort of a running obligation ... for the high-volume sellers."" He added that it falls on these platforms and consumers to report suspicious activity and flag ""bad actors who get through the net.""""If you can take a designer handbag and resell it for 30% off online ... the consumer has to be a little concerned about that,"" Johnston said.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom Nordstrom's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Nordstrom's profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 24% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.08 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.76. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 3.5% per year. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Earnings per share has been sinking by 46% over the last five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Nordstrom's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 5 warning signs for Nordstrom that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

Despite the billions being channeled into the transition away from hydrocarbons.At the same time, there is a connection between the transition and the rebound in new exploration spending in oil and gas. That connection has to do with the new demands that the transition has created for exploration and production companies – pressure to focus on assets with a low emissions profile, for instance, and stricter environmental requirements that would make some discoveries unviable.“While this rebound might surprise some, it must be seen in context. Exploration went through a boom during 2006-2014 and spend peaked at US$79 billion (in 2023 terms),” Julie Wilson, Wood Mac’s director of global exploration research, said.“But in the prior six years, the average was US$27 billion per year in 2023 terms. While spending will increase, it won’t return to anywhere close to past highs and there will likely be a ceiling on the increase.”Related: Recycling Breakthrough Makes Plastic Waste A High Value CommodityIn other words, as the recovery in spending is taking place amid a double-down on the transition, it will be constrained by that transition. Yet it is taking place despite the constraints, which is quite telling. Because the calls to end the hydrocarbons industry have only been growing louder since the start of the year.Indeed, one campaign group dubbed Oil Change International slammed the Inflation Reduction Act as being “one of the biggest handouts to the fossil fuel industry in US history.Story continuesAccording to that group, “With tens of billions dollars in giveaways for the oil and gas industry, provisions expanding fossil fuel leasing, and incentives for dangerous and unproven technologies designed to keep the fossil fuel industry in business like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), hydrogen, and Direct Air Capture (DAC), this law will not accomplish what we need to have a livable future.”Indeed, the IRA has money allocated for carbon capture and storage tech. It also has a lot more money to be spent on wind, solar, EVs, and charging infrastructure, and so does the EU. The West is definitely going all in on the energy transition, despite all the challenges that have emerged recently.If spending oil new oil and gas exploration is taking place in this context, then there must be a very good reason for it, and that reason is not the record profits oil and gas companies made last year. They are part of the reason but not the whole of it. The whole of it is energy security.The gas squeeze that pushed European prices sky-high last year reminded a lot of people embracing the transition that it does not really enhance energy security. It could, at some point, but that would take time, a lot more money and solving several major problems with wind, solar, and EVs. Right now, however, the only sources of energy that do provide energy security are the hydrocarbon sort.The transition advocates were not the only ones reminded of that fact of life. The oil and gas industry itself may have temporarily forgotten it and got a wake up call last year. So now, spending is on the rise. And the industry is tying it to achieving transition goals.“Continued investments in oil and gas will be needed to make sure that the energy transition happens in a balanced way with a secure supply of affordable and increasingly lower-carbon energy. We will contribute to this balanced transition by focusing our investments on the most profitable and carbon-competitive projects,” Shell’s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director, Zoe Yujnovich, said last month.Indeed, a fact not often voiced by the transition advocates, both in political circles and outside them, is the fact that the transition away from hydrocarbons depends strongly on those same hydrocarbons.The raw materials for the transition equipment are produced using machines that run on hydrocarbon fuels. The equipment itself is produced using energy from hydrocarbons—think China, solar panels, and coal powered furnaces—and there are hydrocarbon ingredients in that equipment—think wind turbine blades and epoxy resins.In other words, spending on new oil and gas exploration is rebounding because, first, demand trends have demonstrated quite clearly that the world’s thirst for hydrocarbons is not falling but rising and, second, because the energy transition away from hydrocarbons depends on them.There could certainly be a ceiling somewhere in there as investors flock to new opportunities arising from governments’ transition efforts, shunning the bad reputation of oil and gas. Yet just how high this ceiling will be remains to be seen. Ultimately, energy security would always trump everything else, however noble it might be.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Oil Imports From Iran Set To Hit Decade-High In AugustBitcoin Crashes Amid A Wave Of Bearish NewsChina Likely Tapped Its Crude Inventories In JulyRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
10,6aa87b14-ee19-39f0-ad4b-05e496b60a2e,O,2023-08-20,A Look At The Fair Value Of Tethys Petroleum Limited (CVE:TPL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-tethys-petroleum-144224960.html,1692456144,STORY,"['TPL.V', 'TETHF', 'CL=F']","[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Tethys Petroleum is CA$0.73 based on Dividend Discount ModelWith CA$0.74 share price, Tethys Petroleum appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valuePeers of Tethys Petroleum are currently trading on average at a 19% discountDoes the August share price for Tethys Petroleum Limited (CVE:TPL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Tethys Petroleum Step By Step Through The CalculationAs Tethys Petroleum operates in the oil and gas sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.1%. Compared to the current share price of CA$0.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$0.09 / (9.1% – 1.9%)= CA$0.7dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tethys Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.456. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Tethys PetroleumStrengthCurrently debt free.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Current share price is above our estimate of fair value.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityTPL's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.Lack of analyst coverage makes it difficult to determine TPL's earnings prospects.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Tethys Petroleum, we've put together three fundamental factors you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Tethys Petroleum is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business.

18,513e504a-1bf0-3deb-aabb-b3accbd39b48,SYY,2023-08-20,Is There Now An Opportunity In Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-sysco-corporation-nyse-110017171.html,1692529217,STORY,['SYY'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY). The company's stock saw its share price hover around a small range of US$69.52 to US$76.31 over the last few weeks. But is this actually reflective of the share value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco What Is Sysco Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sysco’s ratio of 20.39x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 20.13x, which means if you buy Sysco today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe Sysco should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Sysco’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Sysco look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 41% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sysco. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SYY’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SYY? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYY, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for SYY, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

It’s important to note that a dividend’s worth is tied to the firm behind it.While dividends can be a boon, dividend cuts signal a company’s retreat during fiscal challenges. Hence, the key is to identify the best high-yield dividend stocks that can effectively guarantee short-lived payouts and dependable income streams for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn streamlining the process, I’ve employed the GuruFocus screener, pinpointing stocks with a dividend yield of over 4% and an impressive 3-year dividend growth exceeding 30%.Dive in as we explore these high-yield dividend stocks and shed light on some of the leading dividend-paying stocks in today’s market.Anglo American (NGLOY)A close-up photo of a platinum bar.Source: corlaffra / Shutterstock.comAnglo American (OTCMKTS:NGLOY) has been under the investor microscope of late and not in a flattering light.The stock is down by double-digit margins this year, reflecting the struggles of a shaky global macro economy and plummeting metal prices. Its second-quarter report painted a stark picture, a 40% nosedive in its underlying EBITDA and significantly lower profits.However, if China rolls out its expected fiscal stimulus, the tides could shift for metal prices and demand, reinvigorating Anglo’s position at the back end of the year and making it one of the high-yield dividend stocks to have in your portfolio.Interestingly, while the firm experienced setbacks in coking coal and platinum group metals, its new Quellaveco copper mine in Peru tells a different tale.This mining marvel is robustly ramping up and targets a copper production of 310,000 to 350,000 metric tons for 2023. Moreover, despite recent hiccups, Anglo remains steadfast, projecting an upswing in metal production volumes for the year’s second half.Story continuesDevon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAmid the trials and tribulations faced by the energy sector, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) emerges as a beacon for investors with a long-term perspective.A glance at Devon Energy’s recent achievements adds weight to a bullish perspective. It clocked a remarkable second-quarter oil production, churning out 323,000 barrels daily. Its third-quarter projections hint at an even more bullish figure of 330,000 barrels. Layer that up with its aggressive stock buyback strategy, having reacquired 3.8 million shares in the second quarter, and you’ve got a company passionately driving shareholder value.The company recently retired a substantial $242 million in debt post the second quarter. With a fortified balance sheet and a growing dividend yield hovering over 8%, DVN stands resilient against market uncertainties.With the Federal Reserve not forecasting any imminent U.S. recession, oil and gas demand is primed to soar. Hence, according to its CEO, the coming years, especially 2024, look incredibly bright for Devon, which is why it’s one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy and hold now.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is a renowned metals and mining behemoth, standing tall in discussions about stocks poised to combat inflation.Newmont’s gold operations could shimmer brighter than ever should inflationary tides surge further. Historically, gold has been a trusted bulwark against spiraling inflation, serving as an investor’s sanctuary during turbulent times.Yet, the latest second-quarter reports threw a curveball, with gold production dipping 17% year-over-year and all-in sustaining costs for the gold segment on an uptrend.However, looking beyond this blip, Newmont’s horizon glows with incredible potential, particularly if the company seals the deal on its anticipated Newcrest acquisition. This merger would solidify Newmont’s supremacy as the world’s premier gold producer, with a forecasted 9.4 million ounces for 2023.It’s also a strategic move towards diversification, which is why it is one of the better high-yield dividend stocks in the mining space.Presently, a substantial 60% of Newmont’s yield springs from the U.S. Enter Newcrest, with its diversified assets spanning Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, and Newmont stands to achieve a more balanced portfolio.B2Gold (BTG)b2gold (BTG) logo on a web browser enlarged by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAmidst the glitterati of the gold mining industry, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) presents a shining example of a powerful performance and a forward-thinking approach. B2Gold has mining operations across diverse terrains, spanning Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. It recently posted its second-quarter earnings, revealing impressive figures and a financial narrative that’s hard to overlook.B2Gold second-quarter sales were at an impressive $470.8 million, up a remarkable 23.3% year-over-year, comfortably exceeding expectations by $9.79 million.Gold production reached 262,701 ounces, and the firm projects total gold production between 1,000,000 to 1,080,000 ounces, along with annual consolidated cash operating costs at $670 to $730 per ounce.What makes it one of the great high-yield dividend stocks is that the company boasts a debt-free statement, with an enviable net cash position north of $500 million and a forthcoming gold mine slated for production in 2025.This venture is poised to supercharge B2Gold’s production by a commendable 20%.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) isn’t just any name in the energy sector, it’s a beacon of astute management and future promise.The firm is renowned for its adept independent oil and gas production abilities, drawing nearly two-thirds of its revenue from oil production. It’s proven remarkably resilient company, even amidst a tepid natural gas market.With a management team dedicated to robust cash returns and a fortified balance sheet, Pioneer possesses a diversified toolkit to boost shareholder value.Speaking of commitment, Pioneer isn’t merely content with lofty promises. The company is hands-on, directly channeling 75% of its quarterly free cash flow into dividends and buybacks, which is why it’s one of the better high-yield dividend stocks out there.Shareholders were treated to a generous dividend of $5.58 per share in the first quarter, followed by $3.34 in the second, accumulating to almost $9 within the year’s first half alone.Pair that with the recent quarter’s stellar earnings and revenue beat, and Pioneer Natural Resources shines brightly as an energy stalwart poised for big gains ahead.Innovative Investment Properties (IIPR)Hands holding a miniature house and keysSource: ShutterstockIn the vast realm of real estate investment trusts, Innovative Investment Properties (NYSE:IIPR) has emerged as a top player in the cannabis space.The REIT became the first to pivot its strategy toward the burgeoning medical marijuana industry, effectively carving a niche that’s as unique as it is promising.With a sprawling portfolio of over 108 properties spread across 19 different states and an impressive 8.9 million rentable square feet, IIPR isn’t just playing the game; it’s redefining it.When you factor in the captivating yield of more than 8.5% and $7.20 per share payout for this year, it appears incredibly alluring.Furthermore, ensuring a steady income stream, its long-term leases boast an average span of 15 years.Layer that up with a dazzling 37% growth in 3-year average funds-from-operations, a figure dwarfing the sector’s median by an astounding 1,860%, and it’s clear that IIPR is poised to long-term expansion ahead.Eramet (ERMAY)Close-up of a gold-ingot on top of a troy ounce silver and palladium bar. Precious metals. Gold, silver, palladium.Source: corlaffra / ShutterstockEramet (OTCMKTS:ERMAY) is a mining behemoth that continues to make calculated strides aspiring to become a battery metal giant.Having dominated the realms of manganese and nickel, it’s now focused its efforts on the lithium frontier. A recent price dip for manganese alloys and class II nickel may have weighed down results for lesser enterprises.Still, for Eramet, it’s a mere speed bump on the route to seizing the fast-evolving electric vehicle market.By the conclusion of the current decade, every second car rolling out could be electric, be it fully or partially. Such a transformative shift signifies a gold rush for battery metals. Moreover, nickel demand is poised to see a twofold surge, while lithium might experience a staggering six-fold leap by 2030.Also, Eramet’s financials are nothing short of spectacular, boasting unwavering profitability metrics marked by growing expanding margins over the past several years. And with a stock yield north of 4.4%, this mining titan aligned impeccably with future market trajectories.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Northrop Grumman's shares before the 25th of August to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.87 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$7.48 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Northrop Grumman has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current stock price of $430.17. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Northrop Grumman has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Northrop Grumman paid out just 23% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 48% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Northrop Grumman's earnings per share have risen 13% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Northrop Grumman has delivered an average of 13% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Northrop Grumman an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Northrop Grumman has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Northrop Grumman, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Northrop Grumman looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Be aware that Northrop Grumman is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those can't be ignored...If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Thieves are going straight to the source.Inventory shrinkage — the loss of items to retail theft, organized crime, damage, vendor fraud, and other factors — is still a major headache for US retailers. At least, that was a common thread heard on recent earnings calls from Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and other large retailers last week.On Wednesday, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer is up against ""an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime."" Last November, Target CFO Michael Fiddelke said the disappearance of merchandise caused a $400 million hit to the retailer's gross profit margin for the year.""Shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time,"" Cornell said in the company's Q2 earnings call.Walmart US CEO John Furner echoed that sentiment, saying: ""Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country.""Retail theft weighed profit margins too. Just ask Home Depot.""In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the earnings call. ""Shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years. It's something we're tackling every day.""Retailers 'not crying wolf'According to the National Retail Federation's (NRF) National Retail Security Survey, retail shrink was a nearly $100 billion problem for the industry as of 2021, the last year data was collected. That cost more than doubled from $45.2 billion in 2015.""I can tell you that never before have I seen what I'm seeing today,"" David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations, told Yahoo Finance. ""The retailers are not crying wolf. They are highlighting a major issue out there.""Story continuesIt's not just shoplifting — organized retail crime and employee theft have become growing concerns, according to the NRF.Violence is a bigger issue too: According to Cornell, Target stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence in the first five months of 2023.""The threat really starts from the point that it leaves the warehouse all the way till it gets to the retail store,"" Marty Andrews, VF Corporation (VFC) vice president of loss prevention, told Yahoo Finance.A security guard, right, stands at the entrance to a Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021, where a recent smash-and-grab robbery took place. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)And ""successful outcomes for the thieves"" are only making matters worse, Marq Claxton, director of political affairs and public relations at the Black Law Enforcement Alliance and a former NYPD officer, told Yahoo Finance. Claxton warned that thieves are ""becoming more violent, more aggressive, more frequent with more people.""The issue gained more attention last weekend after thieves got away with roughly $300,000 in merchandise after a ""flash rob"" at a Nordstrom (JWN) in California.""They're in a position now where these types of flash robberies, these smash-and-grabs — or they've been called 'mobberies' — are very lucrative and very successful for them,"" Claxton said. ""So until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these types of activities.""Locked-up merchandise 'a fine line'The problem is a double-edged sword for retailers and consumers alike.More retailers have locked up higher-ticket items behind plexiglass and installed cameras and other security systems, but these measures come with trade-offs.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company prefers to ""never lock anything up"" as it's bad for business and interferes with customer engagement.""That impacts that consumer interaction,"" Andrews said. ""That's why people are going to retail stores, they want to be around the merchandise, they want to touch it, they want to have those interactions, so it's a fine line of how do you get that great consumer experience, but how do you protect your product?""Leo Pichardo, a store associate at Gristedes supermarket, retrieves a container of Tide laundry soap from a cabinet that has been locked due to retail theft on Tuesday Jan. 31, 2023, at the store in New York. (Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Some feel the extra precautions are necessary, however.While locked-up merchandise may be inconvenient, ""think of the opposite when the mother of a newborn tries to go get formula and the merchandise isn't there because it was just shelf-swept,"" NRF's Johnston said.Walmart's McMillon said that some jurisdictions need to take more action on retail-related crime as companies focus on the aspects of shrink they can control.For instance, the rising use of self-checkout has gained attention as a source of inventory loss. Some studies and reports have documented customers not paying for items in self-checkout transactions or swapping price tags for lower-priced goods when scanning higher-ticket items.But the extent of self-checkout theft is not widely understood. In a call with investors in May, Costco (COST) CEO Richard Galanti said inventory shrink ""fluctuated ... 3 basis points up, really before COVID, as we rolled out self-checkout, and since then, it's come back down a little bit.""At its annual meeting in June, McMillon said lower inventory helps since shrink is correlated with higher inventory levels. The retailer brought inventory growth down by 5.54% year over year.But ultimately, it's all hands on deck to curb theft.""What we're seeing today requires the government, the community, the retailer, everyone, ... including the consumer, to take action,"" Johnston said.Per the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), more than a dozen state attorneys general have launched organized retail crime task forces to coordinate investigations between retailers and prosecutors.Back in June 2023, Congress also passed a law that tasks the FTC with implementing new baseline requirements for online marketplaces to collect, verify, and disclose some information about high-volume third-party sellers — those with 200 or ""more separate sales or transactions of new or unused consumer products and $5,000 or more in gross revenues"" in any continuous 12-month period during the past 24 months.The platforms on watch range from small platforms to big-name online marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart, where stolen goods can be resold.Carl Settlemyer, an attorney in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said ""it's sort of a running obligation ... for the high-volume sellers."" He added that it falls on these platforms and consumers to report suspicious activity and flag ""bad actors who get through the net.""""If you can take a designer handbag and resell it for 30% off online ... the consumer has to be a little concerned about that,"" Johnston said.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In fact, most transactions are now cashless, and many people don’t even carry cash on them — something that would have been unheard of 20 years ago.$10,000 Quarter: This 1999 Georgia Coin Is Worth Big Money Because of an ErrorFind Out: What To Do If You Owe Back Taxes to the IRSWith Venmo, Cash App, Zelle and many more payment services out there, PayPal has become a favorite among millennials. According to a recent survey, 70% of this tech-savvy generation are turning to PayPal for their money transactions. But why is PayPal so popular among millennials, and should you be using it, too? Let’s explore.Popularity and SecurityOne of the main reasons millennials are drawn to PayPal is its popularity. Sending and receiving money through PayPal is as easy as a few clicks. Plus, it is commonly recommended by their peers. According to the survey and report from YPulse, millennials see PayPal as a “popular, reliable, and a recommended brand.”PayPal’s security measures have contributed to its popularity. Millennials feel secure knowing their transactions are protected against unauthorized access or fraudulent activities with PayPal, while other, newer apps may not be as secure.According to PayPal’s website, it has more than six security measures in place for customers, including data encryption, fraud monitoring and email verification. These measures make millennials feel safe about their money transfers.I’m a Financial Planning Expert: Here Are 5 Things You Should Never Spend Money on If You Want To Be RichSocial ToolPayPal’s success also stems from its integration into social interactions. Splitting bills, collecting money for gifts, or pooling funds for events has become a seamless operation with money transfer apps allowing funds to flow easily between peers.The ability to request or send money with just an email address or phone number has made PayPal a favored choice for splitting expenses among friends. “[Millennials] are most popularly using peer-to-peer payment apps to pay back a friend or family member,” YPulse reported.Story continuesMillennials have embraced PayPal due to its alignment with their tech-savvy and interconnected lifestyles. The app is used as a tool for younger generations to stay connected to each other and reduce complications that can sometimes arise with money transactions.Should You Use PayPal?Taking into consideration its widespread usage, many may benefit from using PayPal just as millennials have. Money transaction applications like PayPal will only increase in popularity over time.If you often split bills, make online purchases or send money to friends and family, PayPal is certainly worth looking into. As always, it is essential to do your due diligence. Research PayPal and its features before deciding if it is right for you.More From GOBankingRatesDon't Buy Airline Tickets at This Time of Day10 Best Canadian Cities To Retire on a Budget of $2,500 a Month3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The 4 Types of Bank Accounts All Small Businesses Should HaveThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 70% of Millennials Use PayPal for Money Transactions — Should You?]"

Click to skip our detailed analysis of Mohnish Pabrai’s background and investing history and jump right to Mohnish Pabrai's 5 Biggest Investments in 10 Years.Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are a few of the stocks that Mohnish Pabrai has built substantial stakes in over the last ten years, with those companies delivering varied performance in the years since.Mohnish Pabrai is the founder of Pabrai Investment Funds, and one of the most successful value investors in the world, with a net worth estimated at $1.8 billion as of May 2022. He is an unabashed admirer and copycat of Warren Buffett, having paid just over $650,000 to have lunch with the legendary investor back in 2007, which he later said was worth every penny.While Pabrai doesn’t have the track record outstanding returns that Buffett has, he is by no means a slouch when it comes to successful value investing. From his fund’s inception in 1999, it has delivered 25% annualized returns, easily beating the market most years and massively outperforming it on several occasions, including 2009, when his fund returned 120%.One of the key philosophies that Pabrai sticks to is to find extremely undervalued companies that could deliver returns of up to 5x over the course of a few years and then wait. As he told Forbes in 2013, he has no interest in stocks that look 10% undervalued. He bets on only the most obvious investments he can find and has said that if he can find a couple of great investment ideas every year, he’s more than happy.Rather than just single stocks, Pabrai has frequently focused on a few stocks at a time within specific sectors. He bet heavily on finance stocks in the early 2010’s before shifting his focus to consumer discretionary stocks (namely automakers) through the latter half of the decade. He then shifted heavily into tech stocks, before his latest shift out of tech and into the materials sector.Story continuesAs evidenced by his current 13F portfolio, Pabrai is not an easy investor to emulate for those focused on stocks that trade on the major U.S. exchanges. He currently has just two 13F holdings, both of which were just added to his portfolio during the second quarter. Instead, the bulk of his focus is on emerging markets, where he believes there are far more highly undervalued stocks for him to unearth.However, given his highly concentrated 13F portfolio, it is quite easy to emulate just his U.S. stock picks, assuming you’re willing to display the patience that Pabrai knows is extremely challenging, but also vital to being a successful value investor.That said, emulating Pabrai’s stock picks and holding on to them for several years may not be a winning strategy, as evidenced by the long-term performance of his ten biggest holdings from the past decade, which we’ll look at below. Rather, Insider Monkey has found that it’s far more lucrative to emulate the consensus stock picks of a select group of top performing hedge funds each quarter.Note that the stock performance figures of Pabrai’s top stock picks listed below are not indicative of Pabrai’s personal returns on these stocks, many of which he sold out of years ago. Rather, it’s to judge the long-term performance of stocks that he once deemed highly undervalued and likely to deliver massive returns in the coming years. In many cases, those returns never materialized.Mohnish Pabrai's 10 Biggest Investments in 10 YearsOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F filings with the SEC dating back to the third quarter of 2013. We follow hedge funds like Pabrai Investment Funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Mohnish Pabrai's 10 Biggest Investments in 10 Years10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $63.5 million (Q3 2017) Stock Performance Since Q3 2017: +155% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 155 (GOOG), 204 (GOOGL) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are three of Mohnish Pabrai’s biggest investments in 10 years, though none of them have performed as well as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in recent years, which has been one of Pabrai’s top performing stock picks since he built a $63.5 million position in the company in the third quarter of 2017, the tenth-largest position he’s held in a stock over the past ten years. GOOG shares have gained 155% since Q3 2017, though Pabrai sold off his stake in Alphabet in the first quarter of 2018, personally missing out on most of those gains.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been focusing heavily on its AI capabilities dating back to just before Pabrai’s largest position in the company, which should quell any concerns about AI chatbots overthrowing its advertising dominance. Those fears have gone unrealized thus far, as Google search and advertising revenue both rose during Q2. Those investments are poised to pay off further in the years to come as Alphabet integrates AI capabilities into its search engine and other products.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a top performer for the Weitz Partners III Opportunity Fund this year, as outlined in the fund’s Q2 2023 investor letter:“The year-to-date’s top contributors Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (also a top quarterly contributor) have generated an enormous volume of AI-centric headlines. Both are at the vanguard of introducing AI-powered technologies into consumer-facing products, most notably their respective search engine. We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”9. POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $72.8 million (Q2 2014) Stock Performance Since Q2 2014: +44.7% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 6 Mohnish Pabrai unloaded his stake in POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX) in the final quarter of 2015 after several years of owning PKX shares. His stake in the company reached its peak (dating back to Q3 2013) in the second quarter of 2014, being valued at $72.8 million. The stock has gained a modest 44.7% in the nine years since, or about 5% per year on average.While POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)’s returns have been underwhelming, especially up until its recent rally, investors and analysts are intrigued by the company’s proposed shift away from being a pure play steelmaker. Posco plans to invest more than $90 billion over the next seven years into renewable energy technologies like batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as further investments into its core business.The investment will surge Posco’s annual capital spending by about 75% on average over the next seven years, which will challenge POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)’s bottom line and almost certainly require the company to raise money and/or take on a major debt burden. There are also questions about the company’s bullish lithium price expectations by 2030, with the company forecasting lithium at $30,000 per ton, while UBS forecasts lithium to sell for $22,500 per ton.8. GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $73.6 million (Q3 2019) Stock Performance Since Q3 2019: -66.4% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 14 Pabrai’s opened a position in GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF) during the second quarter of 2019 and raised it by 35% during the following quarter, during which it reached $73.6 million in value. He began unloaded the position in Q4 of that year and had sold out of it completely by the first quarter of 2020. GrafTech has been one of the worst performers that Pabrai latched onto, losing two-thirds of its value since the third quarter of 2019.GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF) has grappled with both slowing demand for its graphite electrodes in recent quarters, as well as the temporary shutdown of its production facility in Mexico last year. The company’s Monterrey operations, which account for about 25% of GrafTech’s total production capacity, are back in business, but demand is likely to remain sluggish throughout 2023. As the largest supplier of graphite electrodes, GrafTech is well positioned longer-term to capitalize on the steel industry’s pivot to electric arc steel furnaces.The Black Bear Value Fund was bullish on GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF)’s future top-line and margin growth in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“GrafTech manufactures graphite electrodes in North America and Europe. The electrodes are necessary to produce electric arc furnace steel, a more environmental process than blast furnace production. EAF benefits from a global push to decarbonize steelmaking which is driving new capacity in electric arc steelmaking. EAF can self-source their main input, pet-needle coke, through their Seadrift subsidiary. Pet-needle coke is increasingly going to be in short supply as it is an important input commodity for electric vehicle battery production. Owning your own input commodity is a strategic advantage as others cannot guarantee production nor guarantee a profit on an order.EAF is in a unique position. Their product helps steelmakers emit less greenhouse gases which helps drive the topline. They can guarantee their product as they know 2/3 of their capacity can be covered by Seadrift. The market is worried about recession which could result in some short-term pain to the industry. Another area of concern are long-term-agreements (LTA’s) which are starting to roll off. Bears are concerned that as the business shifts to the spot market, the margins will decline. I will concede that historical margins are unlikely to be repeated but it seems likely new LTA’s will be signed.Recall our earlier discussion on scarcity. Their competitors DO NOT have control of their input costs…this advantage will become more pronounced as pet needle coke becomes scarcer as EV production ramps up. That should lead to higher top-line prices and healthy margins for EAF. I conservatively think we own this business at 11-16% FCF yield and presume no new long-term contracts are signed. In time new LTA’s will be signed and the business should achieve a more appropriate valuation.”7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $81.3 million (Q4 2013) Stock Performance Since Q4 2013: -15.5% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 81 Financial institutions were a favorite investment of Mohnish Pabrai’s for nearly a decade, up until the beginning of 2015. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was added to his portfolio in the final quarter of 2011 and occupied a prominent place in it until the end of 2014. He unloaded the majority of his Citi position in the first quarter of 2015 and finished the job the following quarter. Citigroup’s shares have fallen by 15.5% in the nearly ten years since Pabrai held an $81.3 million position in the company in the final quarter of 2013.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has been undertaking a broad transformation initiative since early 2021 that includes divesting some of the investment bank’s smaller and less profitable operations, particularly its overseas consumer banks, with the goal of simplifying its corporate structure and making the company more attractive to investors.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) currently trades at a P/E of just 6.36x. By comparison, Citi shares were trading at a P/E of 11.3x on June 30 2015, by which point Pabrai had sold off his position. While the shares are relatively cheap historically, it’s also true that Citigroup has been underperforming some of its rivals like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). In the first quarter, Citi’s ROE was just 9.5%, while its ROTCE was 10.9%, well off Bank of America’s 12.5% and 17.4% figures respectively.6. Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $87.1 million (Q2 2021) Stock Performance Since Q2 2021: -52.6% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 18 Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) appears to be another disappointing investment for Mohnish Pabrai, and also stands as one of his most recent investments. He held on to a small stake in the retail REIT up until the first quarter of this year, though the bulk of his former position was sold off in the first quarter of 2020, during which SRG shares cratered from $40 to $8. They rebounded to as much as $23 a year later but are back down to less than $9 today.Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) is currently in the process of liquidating its assets, which the company believed could amount to between $18.50 and $29.00 per share being distributed to shareholders. However, with real estate valuations having since fallen, it looks more likely that Seritage will come up short of its lowest estimate, which has dragged down the stock. Seritage anticipates selling over 80 of its remaining assets this year, of which more than half have already been sold despite the challenging market conditions.O’keefe Stevens Advisory took a deep dive into some of what went wrong with Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) – A good idea on paper, hard to execute in practice. When we made our initial purchase in 2018, we thought the idea of repurposing existing Sears and Kmart properties at below-market rents into modern spaces, enabling the company to charge multiples of the prior rent, made sense. Increasing rents from $5 to $20 PSF with a 10-11% ROI seemed like a nobrainer. The return profile made sense, and applying moderate leverage to stabilized properties improved end economics. Multiple changes at the management level and a $1.44B loan from Berkshire with a 7% interest rate and covenants (yes, those still exist) made this an impossible endeavor. We thought partnering with Eddie Lampert would align our interests and prove an intelligent decision, given the capital and brain power he has put into this situation.On paper, selling non-core assets and using the proceeds to fund Capex plans and ongoing corporate expenses makes sense. The problem is the number of properties the company needed to sell for this business model to work. Every year that went by materially lowered the company’s value as the interest expense proved to be a heavy burden. The company essentially turned into a death spiral where they were merely selling properties to meet the interest expense and having little remaining for the core part of the business plan. Compiling all this with the lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 and the supply chain mess still being worked through has further delayed this turnaround.Today the company is much smaller. Seritage once owned 253 properties totaling 39m SF compared to today, where they own161 properties and 19m SF. During this time, they only paid down $100m of the term loan. The turnaround has taken too long, and the company has put itself up for sale. Again, on paper, this seems like a good idea; however, going through a sale of this proportion will take a long time in a calm environment. The rise in interest rates, tight credit markets, and equity market volatility make this a monumental task. I suspect the number of buyers for these properties, which was once small to begin with, is down to a handful. A critical issue with the SRG portfolio is that the assets are spread out across the country. One player is not going to purchase all these assets. Real Estate Developers and owners tend to concentrate their efforts on a single region (excluding the global players such as Blackstone, Simon, and other private equity groups). Seritage may be able to sell some nearby properties as a package but would likely take a discount to FV, or it has to sell each property one by one…(Click here to read the full text) See where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Micron Technology, Inc.

If you want to skip out on what a cheap stock is in financial terms and about Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy in general, then take a look at 5 Cheapest Stocks Warren Buffett Owns. For those untrained in all things finance and the stock market, the success of Warren Buffett can appear daunting and unimaginable. After all, being worth hundreds of billions of dollars without setting up a successful manufacturing or technology business is quite rare, a fact that is clear when we look at the wealth of hedge fund bosses.If we were to use two words to describe his investment approach, it would be Value and Dividends. Mr. Buffett is an old school player who is renowned for his patience and meticulousness when it comes to finding good stocks. This falls in line with the first word we've used above. Meticulousness in stock picking is when an investor carefully evaluates companies to determine whether their intrinsic value is greater than their market value. The most common approach to doing this is what is called a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis uses a firm's financial statements and projects its revenue, costs, and net income for years into the future. Then, these figures are used to determine its cash flows - which represent the money that is truly generated as value. These cash flows are discounted to their present value, and when divided with the shares outstanding, they provide an intrinsic value per share. If this value is below the current market share price, then the company is undervalued, and if it's higher then the company is overvalued by the stock market.However, Mr. Buffett is also known for not relying exclusively on DCF models for his investment decisions, perhaps because the model is quite unreliable as tiny changes can impact its output significantly. Rather, his investment approach has been in play for thousands of years, with the investor explaining in 2000:Story continuesLeaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical. Indeed, the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn’t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush ¾ and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don’t literally think birds. Think dollars.Aesop’s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is immutable. It applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants. And neither the advent of the steam engine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota – nor will the Internet. Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.An oracle, quoting an oracle. What else could you ask for really? Another crucial tenet of Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy is the margin of safety. This is a rather tricky but simple concept to understand once you get the hang of it. A margin of safety works together with the intrinsic value of a stock to protect the investor against any errors in judgment when calculating the intrinsic value. So, if a firm's shares are trading at $100, but its calculated intrinsic value is $50 then the investment decision will be influenced by the margin. A $50 share price estimate can be a buying point if the margin of safety is 0%. However, if this margin is set at 50%, then the buying point shifts lower to $25, and this becomes the new entry point to protect the investor against significant losses.The second word that we've used for Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy is Dividends. Rather than some investors who might spend their dividends, he continues to reinvest them into the stock to increase the value of the investment over time without actually generating additional capital. We've covered some of his biggest investment plays in our coverage of Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks so you can check it out if you want to learn more.When buying groceries, you might consider eggs to be cheap if they are available below $3 per dozen for instance. After all, it's difficult (but not impossible) to calculate the price to earnings ratio for eggs. However, when buying stocks, the market share price is often divided by either annual earnings per share, the latest twelve month period earnings per share, or the projected earnings per share. These are then compared to industry averages to determine if a stock is cheap (if the P/E is lower than the industry readings) or expensive (vice versa).

Thieves are going straight to the source.Inventory shrinkage — the loss of items to retail theft, organized crime, damage, vendor fraud, and other factors — is still a major headache for US retailers. At least, that was a common thread heard on recent earnings calls from Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and other large retailers last week.On Wednesday, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer is up against ""an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime."" Last November, Target CFO Michael Fiddelke said the disappearance of merchandise caused a $400 million hit to the retailer's gross profit margin for the year.""Shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time,"" Cornell said in the company's Q2 earnings call.Walmart US CEO John Furner echoed that sentiment, saying: ""Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country.""Retail theft weighed profit margins too. Just ask Home Depot.""In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink,"" Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said on the earnings call. ""Shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years. It's something we're tackling every day.""Retailers 'not crying wolf'According to the National Retail Federation's (NRF) National Retail Security Survey, retail shrink was a nearly $100 billion problem for the industry as of 2021, the last year data was collected. That cost more than doubled from $45.2 billion in 2015.""I can tell you that never before have I seen what I'm seeing today,"" David Johnston, NRF vice president of asset protection and retail operations, told Yahoo Finance. ""The retailers are not crying wolf. They are highlighting a major issue out there.""Story continuesIt's not just shoplifting — organized retail crime and employee theft have become growing concerns, according to the NRF.Violence is a bigger issue too: According to Cornell, Target stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence in the first five months of 2023.""The threat really starts from the point that it leaves the warehouse all the way till it gets to the retail store,"" Marty Andrews, VF Corporation (VFC) vice president of loss prevention, told Yahoo Finance.A security guard, right, stands at the entrance to a Nordstrom department store at the Grove mall in Los Angeles, Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021, where a recent smash-and-grab robbery took place. (Jae C. Hong/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)And ""successful outcomes for the thieves"" are only making matters worse, Marq Claxton, director of political affairs and public relations at the Black Law Enforcement Alliance and a former NYPD officer, told Yahoo Finance. Claxton warned that thieves are ""becoming more violent, more aggressive, more frequent with more people.""The issue gained more attention last weekend after thieves got away with roughly $300,000 in merchandise after a ""flash rob"" at a Nordstrom (JWN) in California.""They're in a position now where these types of flash robberies, these smash-and-grabs — or they've been called 'mobberies' — are very lucrative and very successful for them,"" Claxton said. ""So until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these types of activities.""Locked-up merchandise 'a fine line'The problem is a double-edged sword for retailers and consumers alike.More retailers have locked up higher-ticket items behind plexiglass and installed cameras and other security systems, but these measures come with trade-offs.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company prefers to ""never lock anything up"" as it's bad for business and interferes with customer engagement.""That impacts that consumer interaction,"" Andrews said. ""That's why people are going to retail stores, they want to be around the merchandise, they want to touch it, they want to have those interactions, so it's a fine line of how do you get that great consumer experience, but how do you protect your product?""Leo Pichardo, a store associate at Gristedes supermarket, retrieves a container of Tide laundry soap from a cabinet that has been locked due to retail theft on Tuesday Jan. 31, 2023, at the store in New York. (Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Some feel the extra precautions are necessary, however.While locked-up merchandise may be inconvenient, ""think of the opposite when the mother of a newborn tries to go get formula and the merchandise isn't there because it was just shelf-swept,"" NRF's Johnston said.Walmart's McMillon said that some jurisdictions need to take more action on retail-related crime as companies focus on the aspects of shrink they can control.For instance, the rising use of self-checkout has gained attention as a source of inventory loss. Some studies and reports have documented customers not paying for items in self-checkout transactions or swapping price tags for lower-priced goods when scanning higher-ticket items.But the extent of self-checkout theft is not widely understood. In a call with investors in May, Costco (COST) CEO Richard Galanti said inventory shrink ""fluctuated ... 3 basis points up, really before COVID, as we rolled out self-checkout, and since then, it's come back down a little bit.""At its annual meeting in June, McMillon said lower inventory helps since shrink is correlated with higher inventory levels. The retailer brought inventory growth down by 5.54% year over year.But ultimately, it's all hands on deck to curb theft.""What we're seeing today requires the government, the community, the retailer, everyone, ... including the consumer, to take action,"" Johnston said.Per the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), more than a dozen state attorneys general have launched organized retail crime task forces to coordinate investigations between retailers and prosecutors.Back in June 2023, Congress also passed a law that tasks the FTC with implementing new baseline requirements for online marketplaces to collect, verify, and disclose some information about high-volume third-party sellers — those with 200 or ""more separate sales or transactions of new or unused consumer products and $5,000 or more in gross revenues"" in any continuous 12-month period during the past 24 months.The platforms on watch range from small platforms to big-name online marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart, where stolen goods can be resold.Carl Settlemyer, an attorney in the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said ""it's sort of a running obligation ... for the high-volume sellers."" He added that it falls on these platforms and consumers to report suspicious activity and flag ""bad actors who get through the net.""""If you can take a designer handbag and resell it for 30% off online ... the consumer has to be a little concerned about that,"" Johnston said.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Ross Stores How Fast Is Ross Stores Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Ross Stores' shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 44%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$763m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Story continuesIs Ross Stores Worth Keeping An Eye On?Ross Stores' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Ross Stores for a spot on your watchlist.

You can skip our detailed analysis of high dividend yield stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% Yield. Stocks with higher dividend yields have historically performed better than those with lower yields in certain periods. According to a study by Heartland Advisors, between 1928 and December 2017, portfolios of companies that paid dividends performed better than portfolios of companies that didn't. In particular, portfolios with higher dividend yields generally did better than those with lower yields. The report also mentioned that Bank of America-Merrill Lynch split Russell 1000 companies into five groups from 1984 to 2010. They discovered that the second-highest-yielding group offered the best returns when considering risk.Also read: 12 Cheap Dividend Stocks With High YieldsThat said, high dividend yields can also often be a red flag, especially when the respective company’s dividend is not stable. Yield traps can occur when the price of a stock that pays dividends drops significantly because the market expects the company's future earnings to be much lower. Since dividends depend on earnings, a continuous decline in expected earnings often indicates a potential cut in dividends or, in serious situations, even bankruptcy. In a study, Credit Suisse discovered that among companies offering a certain level of dividend yield, those with lower payout ratios generally had better returns. This suggests that the company has more financial flexibility and may be better positioned to handle unexpected challenges or invest in future opportunities.However, certain industries, such as utilities, real estate, energy, and telecommunications tend to provide higher dividend yields to shareholders because of their cash-generating nature. Some of the best dividend stocks with high dividend yields include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM).Story continuesOur Methodology:For this list, we screened for dividend stocks that have dividend yields above 8%, as of August 18.

Among alternative asset managers, Ares has a leading market share in credit products. These credit products generate fee-related revenue, which we believe translates to stable earnings power. Ares is benefiting from increasing investor demand for private credit assets. According to industry data, the gap between current and target allocations for institutions is wider for private credit than for private equity, implying that private credit has substantial opportunity for growth. Ares has generated strong historical returns in private credit. Demand for private credit funding has increased from private equity sponsors, who are Ares’s primary customers. This increased demand has resulted in market share gains for private credit against the banks and public markets, and we believe that trend will continue. We think that scale and relationships are Ares’ most important competitive advantages and, to the extent these advantages lead to strong returns, this should lead to continued growth in AUM. The alternative asset management space is competitive, but we believe that Ares is well positioned.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% Yield.  Suggested articles:10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Nvidia goosed by rising price targetsThis past week, ahead of earnings due out on Wednesday, Oppenheimer analysts boosted Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $500, writing that Nvidia “remains the purest scale play on AI adoption.” And Rosenblatt hiked Nvidia's price target to as much as $800 per share, which is a new Street high.Rosenblatt analysts wrote that investor expectations for earnings per share in fiscal 2025 (calendar year 2024) ""have risen substantially, but we recommend investors stay the course here and remain bullish amid the recent pullback in the stock over the past month.""The analysts added, ""Demand will dictate NVDA's long-term AI revenue opportunity, but supply should be the primary determinant for its data center revenue at least through C2024.""Analysts are looking for second-quarter earnings of $2.07 per share on revenue of $11.17 billion. For the current quarter, the Street is seeking EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $12.49B.Shares rose 7% for the week to $432.99.Cisco Systems rises on hopeful talk from management, even after soft sales forecastCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) on Thursday issued disappointing full-year revenue guidance, but it topped Wall Street targets for the fiscal fourth quarter and the stock gained on management optimism across several areas, including AI.The company said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.14 - $0.08 better than consensus - on revenue of $15.2B, above the $15.05B average target, on the strength of a growing enterprise appetite for AI, security, and cloud.Story continuesEarnings guidance for Q1 topped expectations at $1.02 to $1.04 per share - the Street was looking for $0.99 - and revenue of $14.5B to $14.7B was in line with targets. Full-year expectations were for earnings of $4.01 to $4.08 per share on sales of $57B to $58.2B; analysts were seeking $4.04 per share on $58.4B in revenue.The stock took a hit on the soft revenue guidance until management talked up the company's future prospects across several areas, including AI.CEO Chuck Robbins said on the earnings call that Cisco is poised for ""further share gains"" in campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing, having gained ""over 3 percentage points of market share"" vs. the prior year in those key areas, and he also said he believes the company is ""super well positioned"" on AI.Following these results, analysts at BofA, Citi, and KeyBanc all kept their neutral ratings on the stock.BofA and KeyBanc highlighted the company's solid execution and innovation, but BofA sees ""additional risk to estimates"" given a ""diminishing backlog contribution"" that would necessitate a ""significant order recovery throughout F24, which might not materialize."" And KeyBanc is staying neutral until it sees ""more consistent signs of share gains and improved visibility into F2H24 order growth ramp.""Citi similarly said it is staying on the sidelines until it sees further market share gains in ""switch and security,"" adding that Cisco's talk of AI share gains was ""encouraging,"" but ""we await third party data verification to get more excited about share gains.""Evercore, however, maintained its Outperform rating on Cisco and raised the target price by $3 to $63, arguing that the fiscal 2024 guidance is ""fairly conservative with room for upside"" across multiple segments. It also believes the company's commitment to ""showing operating leverage,"" and more consistent share buyback of some $1.5B quarterly, ""will resonate with investors and provide higher predictability for CSCO shareholders going forward.""Cisco shares climbed 2.3% to $55.04 for the week.Tesla cuts prices in China, spurring concernsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced price cuts on its vehicles in China last week, further fueling worries of a potential price war in the country's lucrative electric vehicle (EV) market.On Monday, the Elon Musk-led EV giant slashed prices for its Model Y long-range and performance editions in China by CNY 14,000, reinvigorating concerns that the firm's rivals in the world's biggest auto market will also be persuaded to roll out similar moves.And two days later, it lowered the price of its Model X sport utility vehicles and Model S sedans in inventory by as much as CNY 70,000 (CNY 1 = $0.1371), a statement on the company's WeChat account read.Tesla has been racing to secure its share of a fiercely competitive Chinese market. The firm's shipments in the country slipped by 31% in July, touching their lowest level this year, while global production is expected to fall in the third quarter.In a call with analysts last month, Musk said it made sense to ""sacrifice margins to make more vehicles,"" arguing that the value of Tesla's cars will go up once its Full Self-Driving mode is perfected.Evercore ISI analysts predicted in a research note that comparable targeted price reductions might be seen in the U.S. and Europe.And Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that ""Investors are becoming more cautious on China EVs after a solid run in the past 3 months, with Tesla's further promotional activity of particular concern.""Shares slid 8.5% to $215.49 for the week.Coinbase clears critical regulatory hurdleCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) announced Wednesday it has successfully obtained regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM).This new status, which the company called a ""critical milestone,"" enables eligible customers in the US to access cryptocurrency futures via Coinbase’s platforms.Coinbase filed an application with the NFA for registration as an FCM in September 2021. Nearly two years later, the company received the green light from regulators.Shares gained on the announcement, but were still down 8.5% for the week to $73.19.Senad Karaahmetovic, Yasin Ebrahim, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.***Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

However, it is believed that the outlay is seen as insufficient to match the Government’s artificial intelligence ambitions, with civil servants pushing Jeremy Hunt to allocate far more funds in the coming months.GPUs are the critical components in building artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT, whose latest version was trained on as many as 25,000 Nvidia chips.Nvidia’s chips power AI models such as ChatGPT - I-Hwa Cheng/BloombergMr Sunak has outlined plans for Britain to be an AI superpower but the UK severely lags the US and Europe in the computing resources needed to train, test and operate sophisticated models.A Government review published this year criticised the lack of a “dedicated AI compute resource” with fewer than 1,000 high-end Nvidia chips available to researchers.It recommended that at least 3,000 “top-spec” GPUs be made available as soon as possible.Mr Hunt set aside £900m for computing resources in March, although the majority of that is expected to be spent on a traditional “exascale” supercomputer.It is believed that slightly more than £50m was assigned to AI resources, but that the bill is expected to rise to between £70m and £100m amid a global race for the chips powering AI.Officials are likely to press for more funding to be released in the Autumn Statement, which could take place around an AI safety summit in November.Story continuesLast week The Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia had bought at least 3,000 Nvidia H100 processors, the company’s $40,000 high-end component for training AI.Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google are also racing to secure tens of thousands of the in-demand chips, while Joe Biden has blocked Nvidia from selling them in China under national security powers.It was not clear what types of chips Britain is in talks to buy.GPUs will be used to construct an AI Research Resource that the Government hopes will be operational by next summer.Funds for the project are separate from a £100m taskforce that will conduct safety research into AI systems such as ChatGPT and Google Bard.Officials have also been weighing up the merits of a “sovereign chatbot” – a publicly-funded language model similar to ChatGPT – and finding ways of boosting AI’s deployment in public services such as the NHS.The Government has been in discussions with multiple microchip companies although Nvidia, whose chips are widely used to train AI, is seen as the clear frontrunner.Mr Sunak is pushing for the UK to become a hub for setting global standards for the safe development of AI. He has spearheaded plans for the AI safety summit, expected to take place at the World War II codebreaking hub of Bletchley Park.It is hoped the event will lead to international agreements between governments and top AI companies on developing the technology.A Government spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting a thriving environment for compute in the UK which maintains our position as a global leader across science, innovation and technology.”Nvidia did not comment.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) share price is up 66% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 22% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Genuine Parts achieved compound earnings per share growth of 192% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Genuine Parts, it has a TSR of 80% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveGenuine Parts shareholders are down 0.9% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 12% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Here are some of the reasons why you’re wrong.First, high-potential manufacturing stocks probably command permanent relevance. That’s because – speaking of the devil – AI will likely never replace manufacturing functions. Sure, digital intelligence can replace most jobs with a narrow focus, such as customer service for a consumer discretionary retailer. But to replicate the specialized industriousness and ingenuity of highly skilled human workers? That’s a bit much.Second, these must-buy manufacturing stocks are incredibly reliable. With the population expanding through natural means and immigration, the manufacturing sector will continue to run, irrespective of the economy (within reason of course). As a result, the segment provides a hedge against more exciting but riskier industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn that note, below are the top manufacturing stocks for August.Cummins (CMI)A Cummins sign in bright red.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational company that designs, manufactures and distributes engines, filtration and power generation products, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) might not sound like the most riveting enterprise available. Still, it makes arguably a great case for best manufacturing stocks to buy. As a specialist in diesel engines, Cummins undergirds multiple industries, including transportation, construction, agriculture and mining.If you anticipate those sectors fading into irrelevance, then CMI might not be viable. Otherwise, it should be on your radar for top manufacturing stocks for August. Another powerful catalyst for CMI centers on its passive income. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 2.83%, slightly above the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Also, its payout ratio sits at a lowly 34.16%, providing higher confidence for yield sustainability.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg CMI as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as four buys, six holds and zero sells. On average, the experts’ price target lands at $264.64, implying almost 12% upside potential. Again, it’s a great candidate for must-buy manufacturing stocks.Emerson Electric (EMR)An office building with an Emerson Electric sign on it.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Ferguson, Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial and consumer markets. Emerson provides a wide range of products and services, including automation and control software, safety systems and piping solutions related to valves, actuators and regulators. As a sort of stagehand investment, you probably can’t go wrong with EMR as one of the best manufacturing stocks to buy.As well, Emerson offers an extremely reliable enterprise for investors worried about economic jitters. In particular, the company offers a forward yield of 2.18%. Granted, that’s nothing to write home about. However, it commands 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Also, its payout ratio sits at 42.65%, which is a very reasonable figure.Lastly, the Street pegs EMR as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as six buys, three holds and zero sells. On average, the experts’ price target hits $106.78, implying nearly 12% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the leading manufacturing stocks if you’re looking for a balanced approach to the market.CNH Industrial (CNHI)A magnifying glass is focused on the logo for CNH Industrial on the company's website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAn Italian-American multinational corporation, CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) designs, produces and sells agricultural machinery and construction equipment, per its public profile. While it might not be the most exciting idea, it’s incredibly relevant. According to Mordor Intelligence, the agricultural machinery market may hit a valuation of $65.47 billion this year. By 2028, the segment could reach $85.16 billion.Like the other ideas for best manufacturing stocks to buy, CNH offers passive income. Right now, the company commands a forward yield of 2.82%. Again, this stat runs higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Further, the payout ratio sits at a subterranean 21.35%. Therefore, stakeholders shouldn’t have to worry much about yield sustainability.In closing, analysts peg CNHI as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as five buys, three holds and zero sells. Notably, the experts’ average price target stands at $17.20, implying 23% upside potential. In other words, it’s easily one of the high-potential manufacturing stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company completed a $71 billion acquisition for Fox’s entertainment assets, opened two Star Wars theme parks, and released the second-highest-grossing movie in cinematic history, ""Avengers: Endgame.""The wins encapsulated Disney's strength as an entertainment behemoth that could cross-market its strong IP everywhere from theaters to theme parks and even directly to your home via streaming.But flash forward nearly four years later, and the merit of having all those assets under one roof is in question. CEO Bob Iger himself has raised the prospect that the company is too big. And some on Wall Street are advocating for a break-up.The company's parks business is slowing. Its linear TV division is declining, and so are subscribers to its flagship streaming service Disney+. Not to mention the media giant seems to have lagged competitors at the box office.""Given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why doesn't it make sense to create two Disney companies: one focused on parks, Disney+ and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break?"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson pressed CEO Bob Iger on the earnings call last week.Nathanson later clarified that ""everything else"" would include Disney’s linear networks, ESPN+, Hulu SVOD, Hulu Live TV and Disney+ Hotstar.""I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company,"" Iger said in response. ""As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the linear networks, obviously addressing all of the challenges that those businesses are facing.""Disney CEO Bob Iger arrives at the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2020, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)Amid the declines in linear TV, Iger said last month he'd take an ""expansive"" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling the potential for strategic options that could include a sale.Story continuesAt the time, Iger admitted the current distribution model is ""definitely broken,"" explaining Disney's linear TV assets, which include broadcast network ABC and cable channels FX, Freeform, and National Geographic, ""may not be core"" to its strategy any longer.He reiterated that thinking on the earnings call, calling out three businesses that will drive growth and value creation over the next five years: film studios, the parks, and streaming.Part of that streaming strategy centers on ESPN, which will eventually become a fully over-the-top direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform.Analysts and media watchers have cautioned the network's full transition to streaming will be a difficult journey, particularly when it comes to the high costs of sports rights and consumers footing the bill for an additional streaming service versus watching sports as part of the cable bundle.Selling off the linear networks will also be challenging given the secular declines in linear television networks amid escalating cord-cutting trends. That thinking will be further complicated if ESPN is not included in a potential spin-off.'There is no clean break'Still, a company split would allow Disney to offload its debt, eliminate loss leaders, and provide a clearer direction for its future in a fragmented media landscape.So, like Nathanson suggested, why not just make a clean break?""There is no clean break,"" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich told Yahoo Finance, explaining how Disney's assets feed off one another to power the business, with the studio IP driving the parks while linear networks provide the cash for Disney to funnel further investments into growth areas like streaming.Along with that, the value of ESPN is heavily tied to ABC due to its massive reach on broadcast, yet ABC is part of the linear business Iger potentially wants to unload.""I thought it was pretty clear that Disney wants to own the majority of ESPN. How do you do that without also having ABC and the stations? That's the part where I have a lot of difficulty,"" she said.Instead of separating the businesses, Ehrlich suggested leveraging the brands to create value, citing ESPN's $2 billion sports betting deal with Penn Entertainment as one example: ""There's a lot of intrinsic value in the IP that they control,"" she said.Yet, Nathanson, who lowered his price target on the stock to $115 per share from $120, argued that value is not fully realized within the current company structure.""Given that Disney is in the process of exploring all options when it comes to its future mix of assets, we think there is a clear case to be made that under any scenario Disney’s assets are worth materially more than its current enterprise value,"" Nathanson wrote in a note to clients following last week's earnings results.""Perhaps the easiest way to close that gap would be to create a new company (or “newco”) with Disney’s Parks, Experiences and Products segment combined with Disney+ and the studio IP that fuels these flywheels. This asset would likely trade at a premium valuation given the high moat, iconic assets and strong revenue growth,"" he continued, adding, ""We have no illusions that the market will be generous in the valuation of these businesses.""Unlocking valueIt's a strategy that's been floated for other legacy media giants, like Paramount Global (PARA), which has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target due to its small size relative to competitors, along with its vast array of brands like BET and Showtime, which have both received interest from buyers.On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount dropped its plans to sell a majority stake in BET Media Group after concluding a sale wouldn’t result in any meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet.Lionsgate has also leaned into this trend by splitting its studio and Starz business, which will take place in the first quarter of 2024.Stephen Beck, founder of consultant firm cg42, explained to Yahoo Finance that this new age of value creation is representative of the streaming-first era.""When you start to recalibrate for the direct-to-consumer model, which is what we're starting to see with Disney and others, you recalibrate the business and there's aspects of that business that you just fundamentally do not need,"" he said.Bank of America's Reif, though, maintained divesting likely won't be enough to solve Disney's myriad of problems although there are arguments that can be made on both sides.""I'm not in the camp that says that Disney really needs to split up. Having said that, I think all options, and Bob Iger has made this very clear, all options are on the table,"" she said.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:PRU) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Prudential FinancialThe Executive VP and Head of International Businesses &amp; PGIM, Andrew Sullivan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$101 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$92.80. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in Prudential Financial didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.2% of Prudential Financial shares, worth about US$59m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Prudential Financial Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Our analysis of Prudential Financial insider transactions leaves us cautious. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company.

It’s important to note that a dividend’s worth is tied to the firm behind it.While dividends can be a boon, dividend cuts signal a company’s retreat during fiscal challenges. Hence, the key is to identify the best high-yield dividend stocks that can effectively guarantee short-lived payouts and dependable income streams for years to come.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn streamlining the process, I’ve employed the GuruFocus screener, pinpointing stocks with a dividend yield of over 4% and an impressive 3-year dividend growth exceeding 30%.Dive in as we explore these high-yield dividend stocks and shed light on some of the leading dividend-paying stocks in today’s market.Anglo American (NGLOY)A close-up photo of a platinum bar.Source: corlaffra / Shutterstock.comAnglo American (OTCMKTS:NGLOY) has been under the investor microscope of late and not in a flattering light.The stock is down by double-digit margins this year, reflecting the struggles of a shaky global macro economy and plummeting metal prices. Its second-quarter report painted a stark picture, a 40% nosedive in its underlying EBITDA and significantly lower profits.However, if China rolls out its expected fiscal stimulus, the tides could shift for metal prices and demand, reinvigorating Anglo’s position at the back end of the year and making it one of the high-yield dividend stocks to have in your portfolio.Interestingly, while the firm experienced setbacks in coking coal and platinum group metals, its new Quellaveco copper mine in Peru tells a different tale.This mining marvel is robustly ramping up and targets a copper production of 310,000 to 350,000 metric tons for 2023. Moreover, despite recent hiccups, Anglo remains steadfast, projecting an upswing in metal production volumes for the year’s second half.Story continuesDevon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAmid the trials and tribulations faced by the energy sector, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) emerges as a beacon for investors with a long-term perspective.A glance at Devon Energy’s recent achievements adds weight to a bullish perspective. It clocked a remarkable second-quarter oil production, churning out 323,000 barrels daily. Its third-quarter projections hint at an even more bullish figure of 330,000 barrels. Layer that up with its aggressive stock buyback strategy, having reacquired 3.8 million shares in the second quarter, and you’ve got a company passionately driving shareholder value.The company recently retired a substantial $242 million in debt post the second quarter. With a fortified balance sheet and a growing dividend yield hovering over 8%, DVN stands resilient against market uncertainties.With the Federal Reserve not forecasting any imminent U.S. recession, oil and gas demand is primed to soar. Hence, according to its CEO, the coming years, especially 2024, look incredibly bright for Devon, which is why it’s one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy and hold now.Newmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont (NYSE:NEM) is a renowned metals and mining behemoth, standing tall in discussions about stocks poised to combat inflation.Newmont’s gold operations could shimmer brighter than ever should inflationary tides surge further. Historically, gold has been a trusted bulwark against spiraling inflation, serving as an investor’s sanctuary during turbulent times.Yet, the latest second-quarter reports threw a curveball, with gold production dipping 17% year-over-year and all-in sustaining costs for the gold segment on an uptrend.However, looking beyond this blip, Newmont’s horizon glows with incredible potential, particularly if the company seals the deal on its anticipated Newcrest acquisition. This merger would solidify Newmont’s supremacy as the world’s premier gold producer, with a forecasted 9.4 million ounces for 2023.It’s also a strategic move towards diversification, which is why it is one of the better high-yield dividend stocks in the mining space.Presently, a substantial 60% of Newmont’s yield springs from the U.S. Enter Newcrest, with its diversified assets spanning Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, and Newmont stands to achieve a more balanced portfolio.B2Gold (BTG)b2gold (BTG) logo on a web browser enlarged by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAmidst the glitterati of the gold mining industry, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) presents a shining example of a powerful performance and a forward-thinking approach. B2Gold has mining operations across diverse terrains, spanning Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. It recently posted its second-quarter earnings, revealing impressive figures and a financial narrative that’s hard to overlook.B2Gold second-quarter sales were at an impressive $470.8 million, up a remarkable 23.3% year-over-year, comfortably exceeding expectations by $9.79 million.Gold production reached 262,701 ounces, and the firm projects total gold production between 1,000,000 to 1,080,000 ounces, along with annual consolidated cash operating costs at $670 to $730 per ounce.What makes it one of the great high-yield dividend stocks is that the company boasts a debt-free statement, with an enviable net cash position north of $500 million and a forthcoming gold mine slated for production in 2025.This venture is poised to supercharge B2Gold’s production by a commendable 20%.Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) logo seen on a smartphone with a green and yellow backgroundSource: rafapress / ShutterstockPioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) isn’t just any name in the energy sector, it’s a beacon of astute management and future promise.The firm is renowned for its adept independent oil and gas production abilities, drawing nearly two-thirds of its revenue from oil production. It’s proven remarkably resilient company, even amidst a tepid natural gas market.With a management team dedicated to robust cash returns and a fortified balance sheet, Pioneer possesses a diversified toolkit to boost shareholder value.Speaking of commitment, Pioneer isn’t merely content with lofty promises. The company is hands-on, directly channeling 75% of its quarterly free cash flow into dividends and buybacks, which is why it’s one of the better high-yield dividend stocks out there.Shareholders were treated to a generous dividend of $5.58 per share in the first quarter, followed by $3.34 in the second, accumulating to almost $9 within the year’s first half alone.Pair that with the recent quarter’s stellar earnings and revenue beat, and Pioneer Natural Resources shines brightly as an energy stalwart poised for big gains ahead.Innovative Investment Properties (IIPR)Hands holding a miniature house and keysSource: ShutterstockIn the vast realm of real estate investment trusts, Innovative Investment Properties (NYSE:IIPR) has emerged as a top player in the cannabis space.The REIT became the first to pivot its strategy toward the burgeoning medical marijuana industry, effectively carving a niche that’s as unique as it is promising.With a sprawling portfolio of over 108 properties spread across 19 different states and an impressive 8.9 million rentable square feet, IIPR isn’t just playing the game; it’s redefining it.When you factor in the captivating yield of more than 8.5% and $7.20 per share payout for this year, it appears incredibly alluring.Furthermore, ensuring a steady income stream, its long-term leases boast an average span of 15 years.Layer that up with a dazzling 37% growth in 3-year average funds-from-operations, a figure dwarfing the sector’s median by an astounding 1,860%, and it’s clear that IIPR is poised to long-term expansion ahead.Eramet (ERMAY)Close-up of a gold-ingot on top of a troy ounce silver and palladium bar.

Schneider / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) faces a 13% share price decline this year, primarily due to repeated dividend cuts driven by declining cash flow. The company’s Q2 report revealed its fourth dividend reduction, with a new quarterly payment of 49 cents per share, down 32%. This move has frustrated investors, leading to selling of DVN stock as Q2 earnings dropped to a two-year low of $690 million and free cash flow decreased by 50% year-over-year to $326 million.Devon Energy achieved record Q2 oil production at 323,000 barrels per day, with Q3 projections up to 330,000 barrels. Stock buybacks of 3.8 million shares in Q2 and 39.6 million since late 2021 enhanced shareholder value. Retiring $242 million debt in Q2 lowered the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.7x.A stronger balance sheet yields a 4.6% dividend. Absence of a predicted U.S. recession supports oil and gas demand.

Click to skip our detailed analysis of Mohnish Pabrai’s background and investing history and jump right to Mohnish Pabrai's 5 Biggest Investments in 10 Years.Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are a few of the stocks that Mohnish Pabrai has built substantial stakes in over the last ten years, with those companies delivering varied performance in the years since.Mohnish Pabrai is the founder of Pabrai Investment Funds, and one of the most successful value investors in the world, with a net worth estimated at $1.8 billion as of May 2022. He is an unabashed admirer and copycat of Warren Buffett, having paid just over $650,000 to have lunch with the legendary investor back in 2007, which he later said was worth every penny.While Pabrai doesn’t have the track record outstanding returns that Buffett has, he is by no means a slouch when it comes to successful value investing. From his fund’s inception in 1999, it has delivered 25% annualized returns, easily beating the market most years and massively outperforming it on several occasions, including 2009, when his fund returned 120%.One of the key philosophies that Pabrai sticks to is to find extremely undervalued companies that could deliver returns of up to 5x over the course of a few years and then wait. As he told Forbes in 2013, he has no interest in stocks that look 10% undervalued. He bets on only the most obvious investments he can find and has said that if he can find a couple of great investment ideas every year, he’s more than happy.Rather than just single stocks, Pabrai has frequently focused on a few stocks at a time within specific sectors. He bet heavily on finance stocks in the early 2010’s before shifting his focus to consumer discretionary stocks (namely automakers) through the latter half of the decade. He then shifted heavily into tech stocks, before his latest shift out of tech and into the materials sector.Story continuesAs evidenced by his current 13F portfolio, Pabrai is not an easy investor to emulate for those focused on stocks that trade on the major U.S. exchanges. He currently has just two 13F holdings, both of which were just added to his portfolio during the second quarter. Instead, the bulk of his focus is on emerging markets, where he believes there are far more highly undervalued stocks for him to unearth.However, given his highly concentrated 13F portfolio, it is quite easy to emulate just his U.S. stock picks, assuming you’re willing to display the patience that Pabrai knows is extremely challenging, but also vital to being a successful value investor.That said, emulating Pabrai’s stock picks and holding on to them for several years may not be a winning strategy, as evidenced by the long-term performance of his ten biggest holdings from the past decade, which we’ll look at below. Rather, Insider Monkey has found that it’s far more lucrative to emulate the consensus stock picks of a select group of top performing hedge funds each quarter.Note that the stock performance figures of Pabrai’s top stock picks listed below are not indicative of Pabrai’s personal returns on these stocks, many of which he sold out of years ago. Rather, it’s to judge the long-term performance of stocks that he once deemed highly undervalued and likely to deliver massive returns in the coming years. In many cases, those returns never materialized.Mohnish Pabrai's 10 Biggest Investments in 10 YearsOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F filings with the SEC dating back to the third quarter of 2013. We follow hedge funds like Pabrai Investment Funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Mohnish Pabrai's 10 Biggest Investments in 10 Years10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $63.5 million (Q3 2017) Stock Performance Since Q3 2017: +155% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 155 (GOOG), 204 (GOOGL) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are three of Mohnish Pabrai’s biggest investments in 10 years, though none of them have performed as well as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in recent years, which has been one of Pabrai’s top performing stock picks since he built a $63.5 million position in the company in the third quarter of 2017, the tenth-largest position he’s held in a stock over the past ten years. GOOG shares have gained 155% since Q3 2017, though Pabrai sold off his stake in Alphabet in the first quarter of 2018, personally missing out on most of those gains.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been focusing heavily on its AI capabilities dating back to just before Pabrai’s largest position in the company, which should quell any concerns about AI chatbots overthrowing its advertising dominance. Those fears have gone unrealized thus far, as Google search and advertising revenue both rose during Q2. Those investments are poised to pay off further in the years to come as Alphabet integrates AI capabilities into its search engine and other products.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a top performer for the Weitz Partners III Opportunity Fund this year, as outlined in the fund’s Q2 2023 investor letter:“The year-to-date’s top contributors Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (also a top quarterly contributor) have generated an enormous volume of AI-centric headlines. Both are at the vanguard of introducing AI-powered technologies into consumer-facing products, most notably their respective search engine. We trimmed several of the year’s winners on strength, including Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP), and CarMax.”9. POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $72.8 million (Q2 2014) Stock Performance Since Q2 2014: +44.7% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 6 Mohnish Pabrai unloaded his stake in POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX) in the final quarter of 2015 after several years of owning PKX shares. His stake in the company reached its peak (dating back to Q3 2013) in the second quarter of 2014, being valued at $72.8 million. The stock has gained a modest 44.7% in the nine years since, or about 5% per year on average.While POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)’s returns have been underwhelming, especially up until its recent rally, investors and analysts are intrigued by the company’s proposed shift away from being a pure play steelmaker. Posco plans to invest more than $90 billion over the next seven years into renewable energy technologies like batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as further investments into its core business.The investment will surge Posco’s annual capital spending by about 75% on average over the next seven years, which will challenge POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)’s bottom line and almost certainly require the company to raise money and/or take on a major debt burden. There are also questions about the company’s bullish lithium price expectations by 2030, with the company forecasting lithium at $30,000 per ton, while UBS forecasts lithium to sell for $22,500 per ton.8. GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $73.6 million (Q3 2019) Stock Performance Since Q3 2019: -66.4% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 14 Pabrai’s opened a position in GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF) during the second quarter of 2019 and raised it by 35% during the following quarter, during which it reached $73.6 million in value. He began unloaded the position in Q4 of that year and had sold out of it completely by the first quarter of 2020. GrafTech has been one of the worst performers that Pabrai latched onto, losing two-thirds of its value since the third quarter of 2019.GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF) has grappled with both slowing demand for its graphite electrodes in recent quarters, as well as the temporary shutdown of its production facility in Mexico last year. The company’s Monterrey operations, which account for about 25% of GrafTech’s total production capacity, are back in business, but demand is likely to remain sluggish throughout 2023. As the largest supplier of graphite electrodes, GrafTech is well positioned longer-term to capitalize on the steel industry’s pivot to electric arc steel furnaces.The Black Bear Value Fund was bullish on GrafTech International Ltd. (NYSE:EAF)’s future top-line and margin growth in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“GrafTech manufactures graphite electrodes in North America and Europe. The electrodes are necessary to produce electric arc furnace steel, a more environmental process than blast furnace production. EAF benefits from a global push to decarbonize steelmaking which is driving new capacity in electric arc steelmaking. EAF can self-source their main input, pet-needle coke, through their Seadrift subsidiary. Pet-needle coke is increasingly going to be in short supply as it is an important input commodity for electric vehicle battery production. Owning your own input commodity is a strategic advantage as others cannot guarantee production nor guarantee a profit on an order.EAF is in a unique position. Their product helps steelmakers emit less greenhouse gases which helps drive the topline. They can guarantee their product as they know 2/3 of their capacity can be covered by Seadrift. The market is worried about recession which could result in some short-term pain to the industry. Another area of concern are long-term-agreements (LTA’s) which are starting to roll off. Bears are concerned that as the business shifts to the spot market, the margins will decline. I will concede that historical margins are unlikely to be repeated but it seems likely new LTA’s will be signed.Recall our earlier discussion on scarcity. Their competitors DO NOT have control of their input costs…this advantage will become more pronounced as pet needle coke becomes scarcer as EV production ramps up. That should lead to higher top-line prices and healthy margins for EAF. I conservatively think we own this business at 11-16% FCF yield and presume no new long-term contracts are signed. In time new LTA’s will be signed and the business should achieve a more appropriate valuation.”7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $81.3 million (Q4 2013) Stock Performance Since Q4 2013: -15.5% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 81 Financial institutions were a favorite investment of Mohnish Pabrai’s for nearly a decade, up until the beginning of 2015. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was added to his portfolio in the final quarter of 2011 and occupied a prominent place in it until the end of 2014. He unloaded the majority of his Citi position in the first quarter of 2015 and finished the job the following quarter. Citigroup’s shares have fallen by 15.5% in the nearly ten years since Pabrai held an $81.3 million position in the company in the final quarter of 2013.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has been undertaking a broad transformation initiative since early 2021 that includes divesting some of the investment bank’s smaller and less profitable operations, particularly its overseas consumer banks, with the goal of simplifying its corporate structure and making the company more attractive to investors.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) currently trades at a P/E of just 6.36x. By comparison, Citi shares were trading at a P/E of 11.3x on June 30 2015, by which point Pabrai had sold off his position. While the shares are relatively cheap historically, it’s also true that Citigroup has been underperforming some of its rivals like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). In the first quarter, Citi’s ROE was just 9.5%, while its ROTCE was 10.9%, well off Bank of America’s 12.5% and 17.4% figures respectively.6. Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG)Value of Pabrai Investment Funds’ 13F Position: $87.1 million (Q2 2021) Stock Performance Since Q2 2021: -52.6% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (Q1 2023): 18 Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) appears to be another disappointing investment for Mohnish Pabrai, and also stands as one of his most recent investments. He held on to a small stake in the retail REIT up until the first quarter of this year, though the bulk of his former position was sold off in the first quarter of 2020, during which SRG shares cratered from $40 to $8. They rebounded to as much as $23 a year later but are back down to less than $9 today.Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) is currently in the process of liquidating its assets, which the company believed could amount to between $18.50 and $29.00 per share being distributed to shareholders. However, with real estate valuations having since fallen, it looks more likely that Seritage will come up short of its lowest estimate, which has dragged down the stock. Seritage anticipates selling over 80 of its remaining assets this year, of which more than half have already been sold despite the challenging market conditions.O’keefe Stevens Advisory took a deep dive into some of what went wrong with Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) – A good idea on paper, hard to execute in practice. When we made our initial purchase in 2018, we thought the idea of repurposing existing Sears and Kmart properties at below-market rents into modern spaces, enabling the company to charge multiples of the prior rent, made sense. Increasing rents from $5 to $20 PSF with a 10-11% ROI seemed like a nobrainer. The return profile made sense, and applying moderate leverage to stabilized properties improved end economics. Multiple changes at the management level and a $1.44B loan from Berkshire with a 7% interest rate and covenants (yes, those still exist) made this an impossible endeavor. We thought partnering with Eddie Lampert would align our interests and prove an intelligent decision, given the capital and brain power he has put into this situation.On paper, selling non-core assets and using the proceeds to fund Capex plans and ongoing corporate expenses makes sense. The problem is the number of properties the company needed to sell for this business model to work. Every year that went by materially lowered the company’s value as the interest expense proved to be a heavy burden. The company essentially turned into a death spiral where they were merely selling properties to meet the interest expense and having little remaining for the core part of the business plan. Compiling all this with the lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 and the supply chain mess still being worked through has further delayed this turnaround.Today the company is much smaller. Seritage once owned 253 properties totaling 39m SF compared to today, where they own161 properties and 19m SF. During this time, they only paid down $100m of the term loan. The turnaround has taken too long, and the company has put itself up for sale. Again, on paper, this seems like a good idea; however, going through a sale of this proportion will take a long time in a calm environment. The rise in interest rates, tight credit markets, and equity market volatility make this a monumental task. I suspect the number of buyers for these properties, which was once small to begin with, is down to a handful. A critical issue with the SRG portfolio is that the assets are spread out across the country. One player is not going to purchase all these assets. Real Estate Developers and owners tend to concentrate their efforts on a single region (excluding the global players such as Blackstone, Simon, and other private equity groups). Seritage may be able to sell some nearby properties as a package but would likely take a discount to FV, or it has to sell each property one by one…(Click here to read the full text) See where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Micron Technology, Inc.

(NYSE:RHI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Robert Half investors that purchase the stock on or after the 24th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.92 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Robert Half stock has a trailing yield of around 2.6% on the current share price of $74.65. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Robert Half If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Robert Half paid out a comfortable 36% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 29% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Robert Half's earnings per share have risen 17% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Robert Half has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Robert Half? We love that Robert Half is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.Ever wonder what the future holds for Robert Half?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Whirlpool investors that purchase the stock on or after the 24th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$7.00 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Whirlpool has a trailing yield of approximately 5.2% on its current stock price of $135.15. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Whirlpool has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Whirlpool reported a loss last year, so it's not great to see that it has continued paying a dividend. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Dividends consumed 61% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Whirlpool reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Whirlpool has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average.Get our latest analysis on Whirlpool's balance sheet health here.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Whirlpool? It's hard to get used to Whirlpool paying a dividend despite reporting a loss over the past year. At least the dividend was covered by free cash flow, however. It's not that we think Whirlpool is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Whirlpool. Be aware that Whirlpool is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is significant...If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the UnitedHealth Group share price has climbed 89% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, UnitedHealth Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that UnitedHealth Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of UnitedHealth Group, it has a TSR of 103% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveUnitedHealth Group shareholders are down 7.8% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.5%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - UnitedHealth Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.We will like UnitedHealth Group better if we see some big insider buys.

Wall Street is often forward looking, so it's quick to react to news that will affect companies six or more months down the road.This has been evident the last few days for real estate investment trusts (REITs), as the Federal Reserve continues to talk tough on inflation and traders wonder what the effects will be on commercial property values and rents. It's difficult for an investor to see their stocks losing share value, but that's precisely what creates the opportunity for higher dividend yields for those brave enough to buy during declines.Take a look at a half dozen REITs from four different subsectors that have been downgraded in just the past few days.Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:BHR) is a Dallas-based REIT that invests in luxury hotels and resorts across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts now has investments in 16 properties with 4,184 rooms.On Aug. 2, Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts reported its second-quarter operating results. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $0.20 per share was a 45.95% decrease from FFO of $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $186.71 million beat the consensus estimate of $173.87 million and was a 6.76% increase over revenue of $174.89 million in the second quarter of 2022.On Aug. 14, B. Riley Securities analyst Bryan Maher downgraded Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target from $7 to $3.50.""As it relates to Braemar's luxury resort hotels, we have been writing about RevPAR (revenue per available room) weakening for several quarters,"" Maher wrote. Easterly Government Properties Inc. (NYSE:DEA) is an office REIT that acquires, develops and manages Class A commercial properties and leases them to government agencies through the General Services Administration. Easterly Government Properties owns 86 properties in 26 states. Its occupancy rate is 98%, which is down from the previous rate of 99%. Its leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years.Story continuesOn Aug. 8, Easterly Government Properties reported second-quarter FFO of $0.29 per share, in line with analyst consensus estimates. This was a 12.12% decrease from FFO of $0.33 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $71.37 million beat the consensus estimate of $70.64 million but was a decrease from revenue of $72.76 million in the second quarter of 2022.On Aug. 16, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll downgraded Easterly Government Properties from Sector Perform to Underperform and lowered the price target from $15 to $13. In Carroll's view, the ""earnings run-rate should trend modestly lower in part due to the rollover of interest rate swaps further pressuring the dividend.""Check out:A REIT you've probably never heard of is up 36% over the past two years. Here's how its unique model is crushing the market. This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Kimco Realty Corp. (NYSE:KIM) is a Jericho, New York-based retail REIT that owns and operates 528 open-air, grocery store-anchored and unanchored properties with 90 million square feet of leasable space in addition to ground leases. Most of its properties — 94% — are in coastal and Sun Belt markets. Kimco Realty was founded in 1958, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1991.Kimco has over 5,000 different tenants, with lease terms of five to 30 years or longer. Only 10 of those tenants have annual base rent (ABR) exposure over 1%. Kimco has a Pro-rata occupancy rate of 95.8%, its highest rate since 2019.On Aug. 16, Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows downgraded Kimco Realty from Buy to Neutral and announced a price target of $21. Burrows cited limited FFO growth because of near-term vacancies, refinance headwinds and a slower transaction environment.Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc. (NYSE:SKT) is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 37 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls in 20 states and Canada. More than 2,700 stores occupy the 14 million square feet in the company's shopping centers. As of June 30, it had an occupancy rate of 97.2%, an increase of 2.3% since the second quarter of 2022.On Aug. 3, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers reported second-quarter earnings. FFO of $0.47 was up from FFO of $0.45 in the second quarter of 2022, and revenue of $110.64 million beat the estimate of $105.55 million and was 4.82% better than revenue of $105.84 million in the second quarter of 2022.On Aug. 16, Goldman Sachs analyst Burrows downgraded Tanger Factory Outlet from Buy to Neutral and announced a price target of $26. Burrows sees further upside as somewhat limited.Another analyst disagrees with that assessment. On Aug. 7, Compass Point Research &amp; Trading analyst Floris van Dijkum upgraded Tanger Factory Outlet from Neutral to Buy and also announced a $26 price target.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.On July 19, SL Green Realty reported its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates of $205.97 million.On Aug. 17, BMO Capital analyst John Kim downgraded SL Green Realty from Outperform to Market Perform. But he raised the price target from $32 to $35.""While BMO still sees positive catalysts ahead, they are more incremental in nature,"" Kim wrote.Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE:INVH) is a Dallas-based residential REIT that purchases large numbers of higher-quality single-family homes and then leases or lease-purchases them to higher-income tenants.Invitation Homes has over 80,000 homes for lease in desirable neighborhoods across the U.S. and is now the largest owner/landlord of single-family homes in the U.S. It focuses on communities with strong rental demand and where purchasing homes is difficult because of high prices and a lack of inventory. Its recent occupancy rate was 97.8%.Nevertheless, on Aug. 17, BTIG analyst Michael Gorman downgraded Invitation Homes from Buy to Neutral. Gorman cited a potential slowdown in fundamental results for the single-family residential market.Investors should keep in mind that analysts are only correct about 50% of the time, so it's best for each investor to perform their own due diligence rather than relying solely on the ratings or price targets of analysts.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

If you want to skip out on what a cheap stock is in financial terms and about Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy in general, then take a look at 5 Cheapest Stocks Warren Buffett Owns. For those untrained in all things finance and the stock market, the success of Warren Buffett can appear daunting and unimaginable. After all, being worth hundreds of billions of dollars without setting up a successful manufacturing or technology business is quite rare, a fact that is clear when we look at the wealth of hedge fund bosses.If we were to use two words to describe his investment approach, it would be Value and Dividends. Mr. Buffett is an old school player who is renowned for his patience and meticulousness when it comes to finding good stocks. This falls in line with the first word we've used above. Meticulousness in stock picking is when an investor carefully evaluates companies to determine whether their intrinsic value is greater than their market value. The most common approach to doing this is what is called a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis uses a firm's financial statements and projects its revenue, costs, and net income for years into the future. Then, these figures are used to determine its cash flows - which represent the money that is truly generated as value. These cash flows are discounted to their present value, and when divided with the shares outstanding, they provide an intrinsic value per share. If this value is below the current market share price, then the company is undervalued, and if it's higher then the company is overvalued by the stock market.However, Mr. Buffett is also known for not relying exclusively on DCF models for his investment decisions, perhaps because the model is quite unreliable as tiny changes can impact its output significantly. Rather, his investment approach has been in play for thousands of years, with the investor explaining in 2000:Story continuesLeaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and businesses is identical. Indeed, the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn’t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.).The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush ¾ and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don’t literally think birds. Think dollars.Aesop’s investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is immutable. It applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants. And neither the advent of the steam engine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the automobile changed the formula one iota – nor will the Internet. Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.An oracle, quoting an oracle. What else could you ask for really? Another crucial tenet of Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy is the margin of safety. This is a rather tricky but simple concept to understand once you get the hang of it. A margin of safety works together with the intrinsic value of a stock to protect the investor against any errors in judgment when calculating the intrinsic value. So, if a firm's shares are trading at $100, but its calculated intrinsic value is $50 then the investment decision will be influenced by the margin. A $50 share price estimate can be a buying point if the margin of safety is 0%. However, if this margin is set at 50%, then the buying point shifts lower to $25, and this becomes the new entry point to protect the investor against significant losses.The second word that we've used for Mr. Buffett's investment philosophy is Dividends. Rather than some investors who might spend their dividends, he continues to reinvest them into the stock to increase the value of the investment over time without actually generating additional capital. We've covered some of his biggest investment plays in our coverage of Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks so you can check it out if you want to learn more.When buying groceries, you might consider eggs to be cheap if they are available below $3 per dozen for instance. After all, it's difficult (but not impossible) to calculate the price to earnings ratio for eggs. However, when buying stocks, the market share price is often divided by either annual earnings per share, the latest twelve month period earnings per share, or the projected earnings per share. These are then compared to industry averages to determine if a stock is cheap (if the P/E is lower than the industry readings) or expensive (vice versa).

(NYSE:GPS) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 25th of October, with investors receiving $0.15 per share. This means the annual payment is 5.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Gap's stock price has increased by 30% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Gap Gap Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. While Gap is not profitable, it is paying out less than 75% of its free cash flow, which means that there is plenty left over for reinvestment into the business. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Earnings per share is forecast to rise by 190.5% over the next year. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, it could start putting pressure on the balance sheet with the payout ratio getting very high over the next year.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.50 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.8% over that duration. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Over the past five years, it looks as though Gap's EPS has declined at around 35% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.Story continuesGap's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Gap's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. We don't think Gap is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Nvidia goosed by rising price targetsThis past week, ahead of earnings due out on Wednesday, Oppenheimer analysts boosted Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $500, writing that Nvidia “remains the purest scale play on AI adoption.” And Rosenblatt hiked Nvidia's price target to as much as $800 per share, which is a new Street high.Rosenblatt analysts wrote that investor expectations for earnings per share in fiscal 2025 (calendar year 2024) ""have risen substantially, but we recommend investors stay the course here and remain bullish amid the recent pullback in the stock over the past month.""The analysts added, ""Demand will dictate NVDA's long-term AI revenue opportunity, but supply should be the primary determinant for its data center revenue at least through C2024.""Analysts are looking for second-quarter earnings of $2.07 per share on revenue of $11.17 billion. For the current quarter, the Street is seeking EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $12.49B.Shares rose 7% for the week to $432.99.Cisco Systems rises on hopeful talk from management, even after soft sales forecastCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) on Thursday issued disappointing full-year revenue guidance, but it topped Wall Street targets for the fiscal fourth quarter and the stock gained on management optimism across several areas, including AI.The company said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.14 - $0.08 better than consensus - on revenue of $15.2B, above the $15.05B average target, on the strength of a growing enterprise appetite for AI, security, and cloud.Story continuesEarnings guidance for Q1 topped expectations at $1.02 to $1.04 per share - the Street was looking for $0.99 - and revenue of $14.5B to $14.7B was in line with targets. Full-year expectations were for earnings of $4.01 to $4.08 per share on sales of $57B to $58.2B; analysts were seeking $4.04 per share on $58.4B in revenue.The stock took a hit on the soft revenue guidance until management talked up the company's future prospects across several areas, including AI.CEO Chuck Robbins said on the earnings call that Cisco is poised for ""further share gains"" in campus switching, wireless LAN, and SP routing, having gained ""over 3 percentage points of market share"" vs. the prior year in those key areas, and he also said he believes the company is ""super well positioned"" on AI.Following these results, analysts at BofA, Citi, and KeyBanc all kept their neutral ratings on the stock.BofA and KeyBanc highlighted the company's solid execution and innovation, but BofA sees ""additional risk to estimates"" given a ""diminishing backlog contribution"" that would necessitate a ""significant order recovery throughout F24, which might not materialize."" And KeyBanc is staying neutral until it sees ""more consistent signs of share gains and improved visibility into F2H24 order growth ramp.""Citi similarly said it is staying on the sidelines until it sees further market share gains in ""switch and security,"" adding that Cisco's talk of AI share gains was ""encouraging,"" but ""we await third party data verification to get more excited about share gains.""Evercore, however, maintained its Outperform rating on Cisco and raised the target price by $3 to $63, arguing that the fiscal 2024 guidance is ""fairly conservative with room for upside"" across multiple segments. It also believes the company's commitment to ""showing operating leverage,"" and more consistent share buyback of some $1.5B quarterly, ""will resonate with investors and provide higher predictability for CSCO shareholders going forward.""Cisco shares climbed 2.3% to $55.04 for the week.Tesla cuts prices in China, spurring concernsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced price cuts on its vehicles in China last week, further fueling worries of a potential price war in the country's lucrative electric vehicle (EV) market.On Monday, the Elon Musk-led EV giant slashed prices for its Model Y long-range and performance editions in China by CNY 14,000, reinvigorating concerns that the firm's rivals in the world's biggest auto market will also be persuaded to roll out similar moves.And two days later, it lowered the price of its Model X sport utility vehicles and Model S sedans in inventory by as much as CNY 70,000 (CNY 1 = $0.1371), a statement on the company's WeChat account read.Tesla has been racing to secure its share of a fiercely competitive Chinese market. The firm's shipments in the country slipped by 31% in July, touching their lowest level this year, while global production is expected to fall in the third quarter.In a call with analysts last month, Musk said it made sense to ""sacrifice margins to make more vehicles,"" arguing that the value of Tesla's cars will go up once its Full Self-Driving mode is perfected.Evercore ISI analysts predicted in a research note that comparable targeted price reductions might be seen in the U.S. and Europe.And Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that ""Investors are becoming more cautious on China EVs after a solid run in the past 3 months, with Tesla's further promotional activity of particular concern.""Shares slid 8.5% to $215.49 for the week.Coinbase clears critical regulatory hurdleCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) announced Wednesday it has successfully obtained regulatory approval from the National Futures Association (NFA) to operate as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM).This new status, which the company called a ""critical milestone,"" enables eligible customers in the US to access cryptocurrency futures via Coinbase’s platforms.Coinbase filed an application with the NFA for registration as an FCM in September 2021. Nearly two years later, the company received the green light from regulators.Shares gained on the announcement, but were still down 8.5% for the week to $73.19.Senad Karaahmetovic, Yasin Ebrahim, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.***Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.
