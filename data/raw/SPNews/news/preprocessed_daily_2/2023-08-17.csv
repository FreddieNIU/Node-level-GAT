These temporarily lower net flows reflect our organic asset gathering being offset by expected attrition within certain client cohorts, including recently converted Ameritrade retail clients as well as a modest number of Ameritrade advisor clients ahead of their planned transition to the Schwab platform in September.”He added, “We believe that the ultimate attrition will be in-line with or slightly better than our initial estimates – approximately 4% of Ameritrade revenue prior to the deal or around 1% of combined total client assets as of December 31, 2022.”Also, SCHW has said that it is exiting some of Ameritrade’s “atypical custodial relationships” that are inconsistent with the company’s approach to serving Registered Investment Advisors.Despite this, SCHW’s monthly metrics data for July reflect healthy client engagement and momentum.In July, SCHW reported core net new assets of $13.7 billion, reflecting a decline of 59% from the previous month and 57% from the prior-year month.Nevertheless, its total client assets were $8.24 trillion, up 3% from June 2023 and 13% from July 2022. Client assets receiving ongoing advisory services were $4.18 trillion, rising 3% from the prior month and 12% year over year.Schwab’s average interest-earning assets of $466.7 billion in the reported month declined 3% from June 2023 and 23% year over year. Average margin balances were $63 billion, up 2% from the previous month but down 13% on a year-over-year basis. Average bank deposit account balances totaled $102.6 billion, down marginally from the previous month and 34% from July 2022.The company opened 303,000 new brokerage accounts in July 2023, declining 4% sequentially but rising 9% from the year-earlier month.Schwab’s active brokerage accounts totaled 34.4 million at the end of July 2023, which remained relatively stable on a sequential basis and rose 1% from the year-ago month. Clients’ banking accounts were 1.79 million, up 1% sequentially and 7% from July 2022. The number of corporate retirement plan participants was up 1% from the prior-month level and 8% year over year to 2.46 million.Over the past six months, shares of Schwab have declined 24.1% compared with an 11.7% fall of the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, SCHW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and advanced technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, is at the vanguard of the life science ecosystem that is committed to accelerating and advancing the development of much-needed therapies to more effectively treat mental health disorders and to raising awareness of the unprecedented mental health crisis that is affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. Alexandria's eighth social responsibility pillar, a prioritized focus for 2023–2024, is addressing this widespread crisis by leveraging the company's impactful thought leadership platform and longstanding relationships within the life science and healthcare communities to drive forward actionable solutions aimed at meaningfully improving the lives of the over 57 million adults and nearly 8 million youth living with a mental illness in the United States. Further, in 2022 suicide deaths in the United States reached an all-time high of nearly 49,500, according to recently released provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There is immense need and potential to transform the way mental health conditions are treated and understood, and the work of Alexandria's tenants, venture investment companies and the broader life science industry is critical to reversing the trajectory of one of the country's most complex public health challenges.(PRNewsfoto/Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.)""The mental health crisis in this country is continuing to skyrocket, and the latest suicide data reported by the CDC reinforces why we cannot stand idly by and must take immediate action,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments. ""Our nation has also been grappling with the ongoing opioid epidemic, which similarly drove us to act in 2017, when we forged a partnership with Verily to pioneer OneFifteen, a data-driven comprehensive care model for treating addiction. We remain unwavering in our commitment to helping people on their personal path to sustained recovery, and this dedication extends to helping people with mental illnesses get the support and care they need, just as we would with any other disease. These people are our family, our friends, our colleagues, and it is imperative that our national public health agenda promote comprehensive access to affordable and high-quality behavioral health care and that we continue to pursue the next generation of innovative psychiatric medicines to benefit society.""Story continuesAlexandria established its highly collaborative, neutral thought leadership platform in 2011 with the goal to drive impactful solutions to the most important issues around human health. The advances cultivated by this unique platform over the last 12 years have had a profound influence on many fields, including oncology, neuroscience and infectious diseases, and now the company is focused on mental health and addiction in the face of staggering social and economic impact on our country. In February 2023, Alexandria convened a mission-critical Healthcare Policy Forum on Mental Health in partnership with former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy and The Kennedy Forum. The interactive forum catalyzed transformative conversations around major challenges and new approaches for treating mental illnesses, as well as ways to normalize the national dialogue on mental health and addiction and increase access to care and treatment.To build on the momentum of Alexandria's mental health policy forum, the company has assembled a working group dedicated to advancing the development of more effective targeted therapies for mental health disorders, with an emphasis on depression. This highly curated group consists of influential life science thought leaders with decades of experience across biopharma, government, academia, medicine, non-profits and venture capital.

The increased adoption of the company’s life-saving therapies aided the top line.TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies) sales were driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth as well as the ongoing launch and growing adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe and the United States. At the second quarter-end, the company had sufficient liquidity to meet its debt obligations.However, a contraction of margins and operating in a competitive landscape are concerning for the company.  In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 20.5% compared with the 3.2% fall of the industry and a 5.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $48.96 billion. Edward Lifesciences has an earnings yield of 3.17% compared to the industry’s -7.09%. EW’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 1.62%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesA Solid Second-Quarter Performance: The company recently posted second-quarter 2023 results, surpassing both earnings and revenue estimates.  Across TAVR, sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3Ultra RESILIA. Internationally, sales grew on a constant-currency basis from all regions, including a broad-based adoption of the SAPIEN platform in Europe.The adoption of the company’s premium RESILIA-based products across all regions is encouraging. Critical Care sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery technology portfolio and the strong uptake of the Acumen IQ sensor.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTMTT Portfolio Holds Potential: The TMTT segment benefitted from continued strong overall procedure volumes, the adoption of the PASCAL Precision platform and the opening of new centers across the United States and Europe.Story continuesThe company continued enrollment in the Class IIF pivotal trial for functional mitral patients. Within Surgical, patient enrollment continued for the MOMENTIS clinical study, which is designed to demonstrate the durability of the RESILIA tissue in the mitral position. In Critical Care, the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained positive in the second quarter with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.Strong Solvency and Capital Structure: At the second quarter-end, the company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.51 billion compared with $1.22 billion recorded at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.The long-term debt was $596.7 million, which remained much lower than the quarter’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments level. This suggests a strong solvent position.DownsidesEscalated Expenses: The contraction of both margins in the second quarter is discouraging. A year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses reflected performance-based compensations and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of the company’s growth strategy.A Competitive Landscape: The medical device industry is highly competitive with the presence of several competent players. In Heart Valve Therapy, Edwards Lifesciences primarily competes with Medtronic and Sorin Group, whereas players such as ICU Medical, Pulsion Medical Systems AG, LiDCO Group and Becton, Dickinson offer competition across other segments.With CoreValve (especially on the transfemoral side), Medtronic and Boston Scientific are tough competitors for Edwards Lifesciences in the TAVR market.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edwards Lifesciences’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $6.01 billion. This suggests an 11.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, DexCom DXCM and Penumbra PEN.Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 4.10% against the industry’s -3.18%. Haemonetics’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%.

It's a story of a retailer keeping prices low during a long stretch of inflation and cash-strapped consumers noticing the relative price gaps versus Target and traditional grocers.It's also a story of a retailer that has regained its operational mojo, with tighter control around expenses and inventory thanks to a veteran CFO like Rainey.""We think the result shows Walmart is leveraging solid sales growth,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said in a client note.A boy and his father walk through the toy section of Walmart on Black Friday.

Online sales rose 2.3% in the quarter.""Our customers and members are resilient,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the earnings call. ""They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories.""Meanwhile, its competitor Target (TGT), which reported Q2 results Wednesday, saw a 5.4% drop in sales and shared a dreary outlook for the rest of the year. This comes as consumers' wallets remain pinched from ongoing headwinds like higher gas prices, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, and higher costs for groceries.Sales at Walmart's wholesale business, Sam's Club US, also got a boost last quarter, rising 5.5%, but that was slightly lower than estimates of up 5.58%. The back-to-school and automotive categories performed well as consumers packed their bookshelves and backpacks ahead of the back-to-school season.""Typically, when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween and Christmas and GM in the back half,"" McMillon said. ""I do think our food and consumables percent to total in Walmart US will still go up.""In Q3, Walmart expects sales to increase by 3% and adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.50. Walmart also raised its full-year guidance. The retail giant expects sales to increase approximately 4% to 4.5% and lifted its earnings outlook to a range of $6.36-$6.46 from $6.10-$6.20 previously for the fiscal year.Story continuesWalmart stock fell by 2% on Thursday.The earnings rundown:Here's what Walmart reported compared with Wall Street estimates, according to Bloomberg data.Net revenue: $161.6 billion versus $159.7 billion expectedAdjusted diluted EPS: $1.84 versus $1.70 expectedUS same-store sales growth: 6.3% versus 4.04% expectedSam's Club US stores growth: 5.5% versus 5.58% expectedWalmart US same-store sales growth: 6.40% versus 4.29% expectedTraffic growth: 2.90% versus 1.63% expectedTicket growth: 3.40% versus 2.00% expectedE-commerce growth: 2.30% versus 1.54% expectedGross margin: 23.38% versus 23.55% expectedInventory growth: -5.34% versus -5.54% expectedWalmart by the numbers (Credit: Yahoo Finance, Source: Walmart)What stood out to us:Walmart US gaining market share across categoriesE-commerce is a booming business for the retail giant.In Q2, overall e-commerce net sales increased by 24%, led by pickup and delivery. Online sales now make up 15% of total sales, reaching $24 billion globally.In the US, Walmart continues to gain market share, gaining high single-digit sales growth as grocery shoppers bought more food as well as pet and personal care products.The company also noted that it saw growth in private label brands, which were up 40 basis points, a business it's been bulking up in recent years.""We've seen customers that are trading down from chicken and pork straight into chicken and ground beef, from things like shrimp and steaks,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance. He added customers ""are also trading into private label, and that's about 20% of our business for Walmart US.

(Kamil Krzaczynski/REUTERS) (Kamil Krzaczynski / reuters)Walmart's next megabusinessesAccording to Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul, the retailer has two other ""sizable opportunities"" in its ad business and health and wellness business.The first, its health and wellness business, saw a high-teens increase in sales last quarter. The company cited strong pharmacy sales reflected in script counts, a higher mix of branded versus generic prescriptions, strength in immunizations, and branded drug inflation.Since 2019, the retail giant has built up Walmart Health, aimed at making healthcare more accessible using the retailer's existing US footprint of 4,684 locations.Walmart's other side hustle, the company's media business Walmart Connect, saw a 36% spike in advertising compared to last year.The business could represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company, Drbul wrote in a note to clients, given ""Walmart’s vision, reach, and ambition.""As of June, some of its partners include NBCUniversal, Roku, TikTok, and TalkShopLive. Its growth strategy allows the retail giant to understand consumers' behaviors and refine ad targets as the company focuses on e-commerce sales, which are expected to have increased by 1.5% last quarter.And as the ad market roars back, Walmart Connect and its peers are proving to be pretty immune to macroeconomic headwinds.""Now is the time to be advertising to stay top of mind with consumers and make sure that your brand message comes across loud and clear,"" Ryan Mayward, a senior vice president of sales at Walmart Connect, told Yahoo Finance ahead of the company's annual meeting in May.What else we're watching: C-suite changeupOn Wednesday, Walmart announced Sam's Club CEO and president Kathryn McLay is moving into a new role as head of the international division, replacing Judith McKenna who is retiring, effective Sept. 11, 2023.As part of this change, Walmart US CEO John Furner outlined further executive changes in a letter to all Walmart employees obtained by Yahoo Finance.Chris Nicholas, who previously served as COO and as CFO before that, was promoted to Sam’s Club US CEO and president. Kieran Shanahan, an exec in the International Operations division, was named executive vice president and COO for Walmart US.What analysts were saying after earnings: ""We remain encouraged for growth within WMT's margin accretive initiatives which include +35% growth in advertising, marketplace, and WMT+ memberships which we estimate between 22-24 [million] members. Inventory management remains a strength as levels fell (5.6%) relative to total sales growth +5.9%."" -Oliver Chen, TD Cowen""It was another solid quarter, causing WMT to raise its full-year guidance once again. With investors starting to look toward next fiscal year, we see plenty of levers for WMT to continue its strong momentum and grow margins. 1P e-commerce profitability seems to be at an inflection point. In addition, higher-margin businesses like advertising and 3P marketplace are growing faster than the core."" -Arun Sundaram, CFRA""We expect the stock to trade higher today given the 2Q beat and raised FY23 guidance. ...

Retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Nordstrom (JWN) are falling victim to a wave of retail thefts that are making off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single day. Target (TGT) previously forecasted expected losses of $500 million of merchandise through cases of retail shrinkage. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma details how retail executives and experts are addressing the economic and community impacts of these crimes as part of the weekly series ""Retail Evolution: The New Era.""Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]SEANA SMITH: Retail crime is on the rise. Target and Home Depot are among the names struggling with a big jump that we've seen in organized theft. And just a few days ago, a Nordstrom store in Los Angeles was the target of a smash-and-grab robbery. And according to the LAPD, more than $300,000 worth of merchandise was stolen within minutes. For more on what we're hearing on this issue this earnings season is Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Brooke, it certainly is a very costly issue for these retailers.BROOKE DIPALMA: Very costly. And they actually called that Nordstrom theft a flash mob robbery. We thought-- I thought that was really interesting the way that they framed that. But as you noted before, so many retailers are seeing shrink what they call theft as well as loss of items to shoplifting, damage as well as other errors, you know, really hit retailers profit this past quarter. And as we make way into this week, retailers certainly weighing on this issue.This morning at a call with investors, Target CEO Brian Cornell saying that the team is seeing a, quote, ""unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized crime."" Take a listen.BRIAN CORNELL: Shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time. And unfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction. During the first five months of this year, our stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence.Story continuesAs a result, we're continuing to work tirelessly with retail industry groups and community partners to find solutions that promote safety for our store teams and our guests.BROOKE DIPALMA: And Target CFO later went on to say that their long-run expectation is that shrink rates will moderate from today's unsustainable levels. But so far, they're only seeing indications that loss rates have sort of plateaued. And they're not seeing that loss rates have begun to come down. And On Tuesday, Home Depot executives also weighing in their report then. Take a listen.RICHARD MCPHAIL: From a financial perspective, shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even the last few years. And it's something we're tackling every day.ANN-MARIE CAMPBELL: We are certainly in a battle in retail as we kind of think about shrink. But we've always continued to lean into initiatives that we've seen that can have impact to mitigate overall.BROOKE DIPALMA: And tomorrow, on Thursday, another consumer bellwether Walmart is expected to report its earnings report. And so we'll have to stay tuned to see if shrink or theft and its impact on profits is mentioned at all. But when we spoke to Doug McMillon, CEO at Walmart, back in May at their annual shareholders meeting, he did say that they're most concerned about employee safety that they've had a lot of experience managing it. They also said that it's helpful that this year they're seeing lower inventory levels, because shrink tends to correlate with higher inventory levels. I thought that was really interesting. He also said it does vary by market. And they prefer to never lock items up.AKIKO FUJITA: So you've highlighted, Brooke, what we've heard from executives about this issue. What are experts saying?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Well, I did speak to someone from the National Retail Federation. And he said in his 35 years in business, he's never seen the frequency and the type and the amount of theft like we're currently seeing in this environment. He said it's really beyond a retailer problem when it comes to the government that has to weigh in, the community, the retailer, and even the consumer who really needs to turn and sort of, you know, alert when they're seeing this sort of behavior.In addition to that, he also weighed on the impact, the toll that this takes on the economy when you think about these sort of theft is hurting local tax dollars. And ultimately, it's taking away money from other community services that we could be using those tax dollars for. He also said that if these items are locked behind shelves, that ultimately then will impact perhaps sales for the retailers. But ultimately, we're already seeing an impact retailers profit. And lastly, he said that it's really a thorough an ongoing continued relationship between retail community and online marketplaces.What we're seeing is these theft, these stolen items then appear on third-party sellers. And just recently, Congress passed the Informed Consumers Act. And when I talked to an attorney at the FTC, he said that they've been given the task to implement a new baseline requirement that ultimately has to make online marketplaces to verify and to some extent disclose information about high-volume party sellers. And so really all hands on deck when it comes to this issue of retail theft.AKIKO FUJITA: It certainly is. Brooke DiPalma, thanks so much for that.]"

Horn and Associates Limited.The terms of the transaction are not revealed yet.Ontario-based Horn is a training and consulting agency that provides consulting services as well as leadership development and sales programs to its clients.The addition of this entity to the acquirer’s portfolio is a strategic fit as it will enhance its existing growth opportunities in the consulting space.Inorganic Growth StoryAJG seeks acquisition opportunities that align with its business objectives and allows it to enter new markets, strengthen its service offerings and increase its global footprint. Historically, AJG has successfully utilized strategic acquisitions to enhance its competitive position and drive growth. As the company continues to pursue strategic acquisitions, it strengthens its position as a leading global insurance brokerage and risk management firm.Arthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with several buyouts in Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 15 entities in the second quarter of 2023, contributing about $349 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $700 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.AJG’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations, contributing about 67% to total revenues. The company expects an increase in international contribution to total revenues, given the number and size of non-U.S. acquisitions, along with acquisitions taking place domestically.A solid capital position supports this insurance broker in its growth initiatives, and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. The company expects an M&amp;A capacity of more than $3 billion through the end of 2023.Price PerformanceShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker have gained 17.3% in the past year outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.1%.

This takes the dividend yield to 2.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Microchip Technology's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, Microchip Technology was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMicrochip Technology Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.704 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Microchip Technology has been growing its earnings per share at 76% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like Microchip Technology's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

(AP) — U.S. oil field workers and their immediate relatives would be compensated for uninsured medical costs related to air pollution and heat-related illness, under a bill introduced by a first-term Democratic congressman from New Mexico.U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez said Wednesday his bill would require oil and natural gas companies to pay into a trust that provides reimbursement to workers for health costs associated with ailments linked to methane and smog, including respiratory problems such as asthma.Workers would be eligible to seek reimbursement for costs not covered by private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, he said. Eligibility for specific medical conditions would be determined under federal labor and workplace safety guidelines.Vasquez said the proposal is an outgrowth of concerns he has heard from oil field workers in southeastern New Mexico — and his observations about extensive profits and executive compensation among major petroleum companies. New Mexico is the nation's second-largest oil producer behind Texas.“If you're an energy worker in Hobbs or Carlsbad who has a child who has asthma, you would benefit from this legislation,” Vasquez said.Annual contributions to a health care trust for oil workers would be required of energy companies with annual revenues over $50 million. Those companies would have to pay into the fund the same amount of money as they pay their 10 highest-paid employees, including bonuses and deferred compensation.The bill has little chance of passing in the GOP-controlled House, where Republicans this year approved a package that would sharply increase domestic production of fossil fuels and ease permitting restrictions that delay pipelines, refineries and other projects.The initiative still marks a shift in focus from an unfettered support of the oil industry under Vasquez's Republican predecessor, Yvette Herrell, and her criticism of energy policies under the Biden administration that she said hindered production of oil and other fossil fuels.Story continuesVasquez flipped the district — which extends from the U.S. border with Mexico to Albuquerque — to Democratic control in 2022, under newly drawn congressional districts that divvied up a major oil-producing region of New Mexico among three districts. Republicans are challenging the redistricting in state district court.The bill from Vasquez includes compensation for heat-related illness in the workplace — an area of increasing concern as the energy sector and other industries contend with record-breaking temperatures this summer. President Joe Biden in July announced new steps aimed to protect workers, including hazard alerts for extreme heat, improved forecasting and better access to drinking water on the job.Vasquez announced details of the health compensation bill at a gathering in Hobbs, accompanied by advocates for the immigrant-rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido. The event included testimonials from oil field workers and their spouses, who spoke in Spanish about frustrations with working conditions.“In reality my heart breaks because we're left with the effects of this industry and the corporations that don't pay what they should for it to be a just system,” Vasquez said, also in Spanish. “I ask you today to support us in the proposed legislation.”The bill is modeled after a compensation program for coal miners disabled by black lung disease, under the provisions of a 1969 law, Vasquez said.]"

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary Mon Power is using a helicopter equipped with an aerial saw to trim trees and ensure proper clearance around nearly 600 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in its West Virginia service area. The work is expected to conclude this fall.Mon Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The transmission corridors are located in Braxton, Brooke, Gilmer, Hancock, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, Monongalia, Nicholas, Pleasants, Pocahontas, Preston, Randolph, Roane, Taylor, Tucker, Tyler, Upshur, Webster, Wirt and Wood counties.Maintaining proper clearances around transmission lines and electrical equipment can help prevent or minimize the impact of tree-related power outages, especially those associated with severe weather during the summer and winter storm seasons. Clearing incompatible vegetation under power lines also gives company personnel easier access to inspect and maintain lines and make repairs quicker if an outage occurs.""Taking this proactive step to protect our high-voltage lines is an important part of our vegetation management program and an effective way to reduce or minimize service interruptions for our customers,"" said Jim Myers, president of FirstEnergy's West Virginia operations. ""This work complements the various investments we make to preserve and enhance our electric grid each year.""Suspended on a boom beneath the helicopter and equipped with multiple 24-inch rotary blades, the aerial saw is typically deployed along transmission lines in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This fast, safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week. The saw also eliminates the risk of injury to workers using bucket trucks or climbing trees to cut limbs near high-voltage equipment.The saw cleanly cuts tree limbs 8 to 10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. Ground crews move limbs that have fallen onto roads, yards, agricultural fields or in streams. The ground crew will also flag and stop motorists along roads if the aerial saw is working nearby.Story continuesThe helicopter flies above and alongside transmission lines and may circle around to perform additional trimming. The pilot communicates with local airport personnel whenever the helicopter is operating within their air space. The helicopter and saw are owned and operated by Aerial Solutions and will work only as weather conditions permit.In addition to trimming trees, helicopter crews have inspected more than 2,000 miles of transmission lines located in Mon Power's service territory. The inspections are designed to look for damaged wire, broken crossarms, insulator issues and other hardware problems not visible from the ground. Potential reliability issues identified during the inspection will be prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible. Vegetation management aerial patrols are also in progress to inspect vegetation on the transmission corridor.Mon Power serves about 395,000 customers in 34 West Virginia counties.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Salesforce How Much Debt Does Salesforce Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Salesforce had debt of US$9.60b at the end of April 2023, a reduction from US$10.6b over a year. But on the other hand it also has US$14.0b in cash, leading to a US$4.38b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Salesforce's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Salesforce had liabilities of US$21.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$14.5b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$14.0b as well as receivables valued at US$4.63b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$17.5b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Of course, Salesforce has a titanic market capitalization of US$201.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Salesforce also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesBetter yet, Salesforce grew its EBIT by 1,005% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Salesforce can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While Salesforce has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about Salesforce's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.38b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$7.1b, being 440% of its EBIT. So we don't think Salesforce's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Salesforce  you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

If you live in the United States and decide to buy an Android smartphone from a wireless carrier or directly from a smartphone original equipment manufacturer (OEM), like Samsung, more likely than not, that particular device will boot up with some apps already pre-installed by the carrier or OEM. This is Digital Turbine’s On-Device Solutions business segment at work. The ad-tech company forms partnerships with both wireless carriers and OEMs to deliver mobile apps to end-users. Digital Turbine’s second business enables app developers as well as advertising brands and agencies to create targeted ad campaigns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnfortunately for Digital Turbine, lackluster growth in a very competitive space along with a slew of acquisitions that have yet to prove their worth has battered the company’s shares over the past year and a half. In their Q4’2023 earnings call, the ad-tech company reported year-over-year revenue contraction and was not optimistic about the overall macroeconomic environment. In a recent Q1’2o24 earnings call, though the company beat revenue and EPS estimates, the company has yet to improve profitability metrics and was still focusing on improving integration with AdColony.Story continuesAPPS’s shares are down more than 33% year-to-date, and without any meaningful improvements in profitability, current shareholders are perhaps better off cutting their losses as soon as possible.Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comWith operations in both the United States, Ireland and India, Toast (NYSE:TOST) is a cloud-based restaurant technology firm that provides point-of-sale, payment processing and various other performance-enhancing software solutions to restaurants. The company’s primary product, the Toast POS, allows both point-of-sale functionality and payment processing in one solution. Customers dining in a restaurant employing Toast’s software products will also be able to leverage Toast Order and Pay, which gives them the ability to browse the restaurant’s menu, order food, and pay the bill just by scanning a QR code. Additionally, Toast has an online ordering system for customers desiring take-out.The company operates in a very competitive space with well-established firms such as Block and Shift4, and this has caused the company to make some controversial decisions. Last month, for example, Toast reported it would get rid of its $0.99 order fee to remain competitive with its peers, and investors dumped TOST shares shortly afterward afraid of the company’s dimming profitability prospects. With the recent report that Toast has reached adjusted EBITDA profitability, investors still should not become too excited. Whatever effect this news might have on the company’s shares, shareholders ought to remain cautious as the effect of ending its order fee has yet to materialize in its profitability metrics and a significant amount of share-based compensation is being added back in their EBITDA calculation, which is controversial in its own right.Sealed Air Corporation (SEE)Source: ShutterstockFounded in 1960, Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) is a global designer and provider of packaging solutions that preserve food, protect goods and automate packaging processes. SEE operates two primary business segments: “Food Packaging Solutions” and “Protective Packaging Solutions.” The former offers automated and integrated packaging solutions to food processors, while the latter offers solutions to protect goods during transit. The company has a sizeable portfolio of packaging solutions such as CRYOVAC food packaging, Sealed Air brand protective packaging and Bubble Wrap brand packaging.The global nature of SEE’s business, which spans 114 countries/territories could be seen as a competitive advantage, but in the current macroeconomic environment where input prices, such as raw materials, have become pricier, this can lead to earnings volatility. Sealed Air has missed sales estimates for four consecutive quarters, and this has been due to a variety of factors, including inflationary pressures, high interest rates and “customer destocking.” Destocking implies SEE’s enterprise customers are not refilling inventories as quickly as they used to because they were expecting less demand from consumers.SEE’s shares have fallen more than 20% since the start of the calendar year. With the company expected to report sluggish annual revenue and EPS growth this year, investors still holding onto the stock should reconsider.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Tyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

HBCU eligibility was added last year in response to a trend in applications from students admitted to HBCUs, none of which are in California.Supporting Local ScholarsSince 2012, the Better Together STEM Scholarship Program has awarded more than $7 million to accomplished students. These charitable donations come from PG&amp;E shareholders, not PG&amp;E customers.In addition to the Better Together STEM Scholarship Program, PG&amp;E's 11 employee resource groups (ERGs) and three engineering networking groups (ENGs) award scholarships to help offset the cost of higher education. The funds are raised entirely through employee donations, employee fundraising events and PG&amp;E's employee giving program, the Campaign for the Community.

If you want to skip our overview of the global foreign aid situation, read 10 Countries that Give the Most Foreign Aid Per Capita.Countries that give the most foreign aid per capita are Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, along with the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK. Some countries that have recently started giving hefty amounts of aid include the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Foreign aid is a bridge between developed and developing nations that provides the latter with the resources needed to overcome their troubles. But not all countries contribute equally, and the measurement of foreign aid per capita offers insight into a country's commitment to international development relative to its population size. Countries that give the most foreign aid per capita are not necessarily the largest donors in absolute terms, but they allocate a more generous portion of their resources, relative to the size of their population, to aid. Humanitarian aid given by donor countries addresses immediate needs arising from natural disasters or conflicts to ensure the provision of food, water, and shelter to the affectees. Likewise, developmental aid aims at long-term economic growth and sustainability in weaker economies as it focuses on aid-receiving countries' education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Help from developed countries is also crucial for combating infectious diseases, rebuilding nations after war, climate change, and food insecurity. For instance, health initiatives that have received considerable foreign aid include polio, malaria, and HIV/AIDS. We have already discussed 30 Countries That Receive the Most Foreign Aid From the US and what causes make them need foreign aid; read our article to know more about them. Role of the 0.7% GNI Target as Foreign AidCountries that give the most foreign aid per capita draft their assistance budget to allocate a certain percentage of their Gross National Income (GNI) to help other nations. Mostly, the target is 0.7% of the total GNI, which was initially set by the World Council Of Churches and later adopted by the United Nations. Countries in OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) agree to aim for giving 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) as foreign aid. Story continuesThe idea was that economically advanced nations should aim to allocate 0.7% of their GNI to Official Development Assistance (ODA) to support developing countries. Notably, the 0.7% figure is a target, not a mandatory requirement. Therefore, while many countries have endorsed it and use it as a guideline, they don't always achieve it. Countries that have historically met (or exceeded) the 0.7% target include Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, and Denmark. Other countries, like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have also met the target in certain years.Many other DAC members that are leading aid-giving nations have endorsed the target but haven't regularly met it. These include larger economies like the United States, Germany, France, and Japan. For instance, if we talk about which country gives the most foreign aid, it is the United States, which regularly disburses over $30 billion per year to support other nations. But in terms of the GNI percentage, the US's contribution stays less than 0.2% of its multi-trillion-dollar economy. Contrarily, advanced nations like Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden have regularly delegated up to 1.2% of their annual gross national income between 2018 and 2022. But since these economies are smaller than the US's, their lump sum foreign aid is significantly lower. Multi-Billion Companies That Help Other Countries Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) engage in multiple initiatives and projects to assist less developed countries. For instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has channeled resources into its philanthropic arm to provide technology access to underserved communities. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) often delegates software, nonprofit grants, and technological skills training to empower those who don't have equal educational opportunities. Similarly, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has aimed to bring fast, free Wi-Fi to places with limited internet access through its Google Station program. The program was initially launched in India but has now expanded to Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others. Notably, Google Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among the largest donor companies. Besides governments, some private organizations also take part in overcoming the world's crises; read 26 Companies that Donate to Nonprofits to know more. 25 Countries that Give the Most Foreign Aid Per Capita25 Countries that Give the Most Foreign Aid Per CapitaOur Methodology To find which countries give the most foreign aid, we calculated their GNI for the past 5 years (2018-2022). We translated this GNI percentage to aid figures by running individual searches on the said countries' gross national income in these years, as some countries only state the percentage of their GNI they disburse as foreign aid and don't give actual figures (for the nations that have clearly stated their disbursed foreign aid, we took the stated figures). Later, to find the per capita foreign aid given by these countries, we divided the total foreign aid disbursed by these countries with their populations in the said years. This gave us per capita foreign aid spending of the top 25 donor countries between 2018 and 2022. We averaged these countries' per capita aid spending for 5 consecutive years to get composite rankings and ranked the highest per capita ODA contributing countries accordingly. Our sources for this study were OECD's Net ODA Database, OECD Stat, the World Bank's Open Databases on Population and World Bank's data on countries' GNIs.Based on our findings, here are the countries that give the most foreign aid per capita:25. PortugalAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $44Portugal is an active player in international aid and commits 0.1%-0.2% of its Gross National Income (GNI) towards developmental assistance and focuses mostly on Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa and Asia. The country's commitment stems from a stable economy that gives it enough leg space to help other nations. 24. Spain Average Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $74 Spain usually dedicates 0.25% of its GNI to foreign aid to target regions in Latin America and Africa. The country's motive with foreign aid is to help the health, education, and water sanitation sectors. 23. ItalyAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $92Italy has a tradition of extending foreign assistance to numerous countries and gives up to 0.3% of its GNI as aid. The country's GDP is $2.04 trillion, and the government expects the GDP to grow 1.2% this year, which is above the initial target of 1%. Italy prioritizes its aid to go to agriculture, health, and education.22. Turkey Average Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $112Although Turkey is dealing with a huge load of refugees and the recent earthquake has badly hit it, it's still among Non-DAC countries that have high foreign aid per capita. The nation's strategic location enables it to assist neighboring countries, where infrastructure and health-related projects need monetary help. The country's per capita GDP is $10,616 as of current.21. Australia Average Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $118Australia's foreign aid policy is driven by regional concerns and global responsibilities. The country allocates 0.15%-0.2% of its GNI to help less developed countries. Australia emphasizes the Pacific region to improve education, health, and governance in these areas. 20. New ZealandAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $125Just like the neighbor, NZ is also a kind-hearted nation. New Zealand channels 0.25% of its GNI towards foreign aid, which translates to $550-$600 million. The nation seeks to improve sectors such as renewable energy and health through its initiatives.19. JapanAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $133Japan is the 3rd biggest economy in the world, so naturally, it has enough resources to lend others a helping hand. However, in terms of the disburses foreign aid per capita, the Asian titan falls in the middle. Japan's foreign aid efforts concentrate on health and disaster risk reduction in Asian countries.18. Saudi ArabiaAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $136Another non-DAC nation among the highest per capita ODA contributing countries is Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil economy. The country earmarks a part of its income, derived mainly from oil wealth, to assist nations whose resources are stretched thin. 17. CanadaAverage Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $148Along with hosting millions of people from other countries, Canada also helps them with foreign aid. Canada has a longstanding tradition of international assistance geared towards sub-Saharan Africa. Major causes that Canada contributes to are women's rights and skill development. While we're on the subject of housing millions from other nations, read Top 30 Countries With The Most Immigrants to know which number Canada is at.16. United States Of America Average Foreign Aid Given Per Capita Between 2018-2022: $156The United States is surely the most generous in terms of helping other countries, as it can disburse upwards of $61 billion each year as foreign aid (no other country is even close to this mark). But if we break down the US's foreign aid between 2018-2022 in per capita figures, it stands at $156.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe.Nvidia (NVDA) will report its second quarter earnings after the closing bell next Wednesday, setting up what will be the AI hype cycle’s biggest test yet.During this AI gold rush, companies around the world looking to profit have turned to Nvidia’s graphics processors to power new AI software and platforms.Currently, tech firms of all sizes are doing everything they can to get their hands on Nvidia chips. During Tesla’s (TSLA) Q2 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk told analysts that the automaker will take as many Nvidia graphics processors as the company can produce.That kind of demand is also why Nvidia blew away Wall Street’s expectations for its Q2 guidance during its last earnings call. At the time, analysts were anticipating revenue of $7.2 billion, but Nvidia said it will bring in around $11 billion in the quarter — a 64% jump over a year ago — which Wall Street analysts now expect next week.The Street also expects earnings of $2.07 per share, a 306% year-over-year increase. Nvidia is used to enormous numbers, but these are putting high expectations on next week’s report, and the stock is already rising.Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, speaks during a press conference at the Computex 2023 in Taipei on May 30, 2023. (Photo by Sam Yeh / AFP) (Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)“What Nvidia reports in its upcoming earnings release is going to be a barometer for the whole AI hype,” explained Forrester analyst Glenn O’Donnell. “I anticipate that the results are going to look really outstanding because demand is so high, and that means Nvidia is able to command even higher margins than it would otherwise.”But those sky-high expectations mean if the company doesn’t deliver, it could put a serious damper on the AI explosion and send a shock through AI trades ranging from Microsoft and Google to Meta and AMD.Wall Street is all-in on NvidiaAt the start of trading in New York on Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock hit $445. Year to date, shares of the company are up a staggering 204%. And Wall Street analysts are still upgrading the stock.Story continuesIn a research note Tuesday, Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo increased his price target on Nvidia from $450 to $500. Baird’s Tristan Gerra moved his price target on the stock from $475 to $570, adding that “AI demand is surging at all levels: individuals, enterprise, hyperscalers.”Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offered a similarly rosy view of the company, writing in a research note that “NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters; we think the recent selloff is a good entry point.”UBS’s Timothy Arcuri also raised his price target on Nvidia, writing in a note that the company is “quite literally serving as ‘kingmaker’ as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.”Nvidia is the preeminent maker of both the high-powered graphics chips needed to run AI programs and the software needed to develop those AI platforms. And the company has been preparing for this moment for years, researching and working on its AI capabilities well before Wall Street jumped into the AI craze with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI platform in late 2022.Since then Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and a cadre of AI-adjacent companies have positioned themselves as AI powerhouses.Nvidia is mighty, but not invincibleWhile Nvidia is helping to drive the AI train, it’s facing a major problem at the moment. It simply can’t deliver as many chips as its customers want.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) is Nvidia’s go-to for building its chips, but the manufacturer’s capacity is stretched as orders continue to pile in from Nvidia. According to Arcuri’s note, the recent demand spikes have pushed lead times for Nvidia’s critical H100 chips to six to nine months.During Tesla’s earnings call Musk said Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla’s orders, Nvidia can’t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires. As a result, Tesla is building its own supercomputer using its own AI chips to meet its needs.Nvidia isn’t just facing increased lead times for its AI products, but it’s also looking to keep competitors Intel and AMD off its back. While the company has built up a lead thanks to its early investments in AI, the semiconductor business is notoriously competitive, and, as Intel has shown, no industry lead is safe.“Nvidia is not invincible,” O’Donnell said. “Other companies like AMD and Intel and so on could come along and will come along and steal some of that share. But Nvidia has so much momentum right now that it is going to be hard to stop them. Not impossible, but hard.”Now we just have to see what Nvidia has up its sleeve when it reports its earnings on Aug. 23.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

The award recognizes a company's achievement in exemplary policies, strategies and initiatives that have resulted in measurable results in the areas of disability inclusiveness in the workplace, marketplace and supply chain.""Thank you Disability:IN for this honor and for the work that you do to promote disability inclusion in the workplace,"" says Holly May, executive vice president &amp; global chief human resource officer of WBA. ""We are so proud of Walgreens Boots Alliance's leadership in the space, which we credit to our values, commitment, signature Walgreens disability hiring and inclusion programs and partnerships.""This follows seven consecutive years of recognition from Disability:IN and The American Association of People with Disabilities with a 100% score on its Disability Equality Index. Disability advocates and business leaders developed the index, which is the most comprehensive benchmarking tool for corporate disability inclusion.WBA was recognized with the award on July 11, during Disability Pride Month, a time to celebrate the strengths and achievements of people with disabilities around the world, and for us, a time to look back on our progress through the years.While Walgreens has always championed a commitment to hiring individuals with disabilities and equal opportunity, our revolutionary ""same job, same expectations, same pay"" operating model was developed more than 16 years ago with two signature programs: Transitional Work Group (TWG) and Retail Employees with Disabilities Initiative (REDI). Since then, Walgreens has further expanded our commitments to disability representation through our work with Turning Pointe Autism Foundation, the establishment of a neurodiversity hiring program for corporate roles and the redesign of the annual incentive plan to create leadership accountability for diversity representation. Through this work, Walgreens has enabled thousands of people with disabilities to build lives they may not otherwise have been able to, simply because opportunities were not presented to them.Story continuesTransitional Work Group (TWG): Started in 2007, TWG is a placement program for people with physical, mental and sensory disabilities. Students complete a 10-13-week program that includes classroom and warehouse training, social skills practice and education in workplace policies.To date, more than 1,000 people with disabilities have been hired at 12 Walgreens distribution centers and regional warehouses across the country, with a successful 75% training-to-hire placement rate. The ripple effects of the TWG program continue-new hire orientation for supply chain team members now includes a two-hour training on disability awareness and etiquette.The TWG program was recently expanded into Walgreens micro-fulfillment centers.Retail Employees with Disabilities Inclusion (REDI): REDI is a program that trains individuals with disabilities for customer service associate roles at Walgreens stores.REDI, first launched in 2010, consists of a 3-6 week in-store training program, where participants learn valuable retail and customer service skills, qualifying hundreds of potential team members for retail roles. By the end of fiscal 2022, there were nearly 1,900 trainees enrolled in the program in more than 413 Walgreens stores across 38 states.Turning Pointe Autism Foundation: Walgreens partners with Turning Pointe Autism Foundation, a nonprofit that educates people with autism in the life skills necessary to live and work independently. A fully operational retail store was built within Turning Pointe's center and supported by actual Walgreens store managers. A 9-month training program was developed for students learn how to work within a team, interface with customers and manage the cash register. After graduating, participants become ""Walgreens Certified"" and are eligible to be hired at any Walgreens store.Neurodiversity in the Workplace: In 2022, WBA formed a partnership with Neurodiversity in the Workplace™ to design plans and programs to recruit, attract, hire and retain neurodivergent talent in Walgreens offices.Neurodiversity in the Workplace provides education and greater awareness around neurodiversity by training hiring managers about what neurodiversity means, how to be an ally, and how to provide supportive workplace accommodations. The first cohort is expected to begin work at WBA's global support center in Deerfield, Illinois, this year.In addition to training and work placement programs, WBA sponsors a disAbility Alliance business resource group (BRG) that educates and supports individuals with disabilities and allies by providing informational content, fostering an inclusive workforce and furthering disability-related initiatives. The BRG hosts educational programming and learning experiences for team members throughout the year, welcoming those with all abilities to join, learn and network.A lasting impactDue to the success of this progressive and inclusive hiring model, other businesses, including Fortune 500 companies, have taken note, asking, ""how does Walgreens do it?"" Rather than withhold the knowledge, the company decided to share it for the greater good, establishing Walgreens Inclusion University.Through the program, companies can tour TWG- and REDI-enabled distribution centers and stores and sit in on disability training curriculum to learn how a properly equipped working environment can empower team members of all abilities.""We've always been proud to open our doors to other companies interested in learning about our approach, programs and practices, as others set up their models, through Walgreens Inclusion University,"" says Holly May, executive vice president &amp; global chief human resources officer of WBA. ""The invitation is always open.""A commitment that continuesTo ensure accountability among our leadership, last November, WBA became the first company in the S&amp;P 500 to redesign our annual U.S. bonus plan to include a standalone disability representation metric.This new metric will unlock a pipeline of talent and help foster equity for a previously underrepresented sector of the workforce. As an award-winning employer, WBA continues to combine both our past emphasis on disability support with our future in leading new initiatives to create opportunity and access the value provided by our diverse workforce.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Wednesday, August 16, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/774503/Walgreens-Boots-Alliance-Named-DisabilityINs-2023-Employer-of-the-Year]"

With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the second quarter and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian?Story continuesBrian C. CornellThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our team and our business model showed remarkable resilience in the face of multiple headwinds in the external environment. While these headwinds have led to a temporary slowdown in the pace of our business, that doesn't mean our team is standing still. Throughout the company, our team remains focused on staying agile and flexible as we continue to serve our guests and to listen carefully to them in this very dynamic environment. And we're fortunate to have a business model that's inherently flexible by design. We offer a balanced multi-category assortment that's focused on our guests' wants and needs, allowing us to stay relevant in any environment and to quickly pivot as our guest priorities change. And our unique stores as hubs model, a concept we pioneered in the retail industry, allows us to serve our guests quickly, flexibly and reliably on every shopping journey, whether it takes place in a store or on a digital device. By continuously listening to, learning from and engaging with our guests and then refining our playbook with their insights, we'll continue to achieve our purpose of delivering everyday joy for all the families we serve while reinforcing our strong culture of caring, growing and winning together. As you'll recall, in the first half of 2022, we were faced with excess inventory, driven by a rapid change in consumer spending patterns. In the face of that challenge, the team took important steps a year ago, allowing us to quickly adjust our inventory down to the proper level. Those critical decisions have allowed our team to operate efficiently while focusing on serving our guests. They've enabled the presentation of fresh, seasonally appropriate assortments throughout the year and provided the flexibility to lean into share opportunities in key seasons, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. And importantly, last year's inventory actions laid the groundwork for the recovery in profitability we've achieved so far this year. Our team also played a critical role in our second quarter profit performance. As we began to see softening sales trends early in the quarter, the team in our stores and supply chain responded with speed and agility. Their discipline, along with ongoing efficiency efforts, allowed our profit performance to exceed our original expectations despite a meaningful shortfall on the top line. More specifically, for the quarter just ended, operating income expanded by more than $800 million compared with a year ago. And despite the fact we've experienced more than a percentage point of cumulative profit pressure from higher shrink since 2019, our EPS of $3.86 through the first half of the year is more than 50% higher than in 2019. While this is encouraging progress, we are confident we'll see further meaningful increases in our profitability over time. On the top line, Q2 results were below our expectations as comparable sales decreased 5.4%. Within the quarter, comp trends softened from the second half of May into June, before we saw a meaningful recovery in both traffic and comps in July. In the month, we were especially pleased with trends around Independence Day holiday, along with Circle Week, which also resulted in the addition of more than 0.5 million new Target Circle members. Consistent with recent industry trends, second quarter comps reflected continued growth in our frequency categories, offset by notable software results in our more discretionary categories. Across channels, sales were strongest in our stores, while results in our digital channel were led by continued growth in our Drive-Up service. Consistent with our stores as hubs strategy, more than 97% of our second quarter sales were fulfilled by our stores. As we've described for more than a year now, the divergence of sales trends between our frequency and discretionary categories is being driven by multiple cross currents that are affecting the U.S. consumer. These include the impact of inflation in frequency categories, like Food &amp; Beverage and Essentials, causing these categories to absorb a much-higher portion of consumers' budgets. In addition, consumers are choosing to increase spending on services, like leisure travel, entertainment and food away from home, putting near-term pressure on discretionary products. And finally, the rollback of government efforts to support consumers during the pandemic, including stimulus payments, enhanced child care tax credits and the suspension of student loan payments, presents an ongoing headwind that consumers continue to manage. Beyond these factors in the second quarter, many of our store team members faced a negative guest reaction to our Pride assortment. As you know, we have featured a Pride assortment for more than a decade. However, after the launch of the assortment this year, members of our team began experiencing threats and aggressive actions that affected their sense of safety and well being while at work. I want to make it clear: We denounce violence and hate of all kinds, and the safety our team and our guests is our top priority. So to protect the team in the face of these threatening circumstances, we quickly made changes, including the removal of items that were at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior. Pride is one of many heritage moments that are important to our guests and our team, and we'll continue to support these moments in the future. They are just one part of our commitment to support a diverse team, which helps us serve a diverse set of guests. And as we talk to these guests, they consistently tell us that Target is their happy place, somewhere they can go to escape and recharge. So as we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're committed to staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target. Specific to Pride and Heritage months, we're focused on building assortments that are celebratory and joyous with wide-ranging relevance, being mindful of timing, placement and presentation, leaning into segmentation and leveraging our digital experience and reconsidering the mix of owned brands, national brands and external partners within these assortments. Our goal is to ensure we continue to celebrate moments that are special to our guests while acknowledging that, every day, for millions of people, they want Target to serve as a refuge in their daily lives. In addition to these more recent challenges, our team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime. As you'll hear in more detail from Michael, shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations, but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time. And unfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction. During the first 5 months of this year, our stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence. As a result, we're continuing to work tirelessly with retail industry groups and community partners to find solutions to promote safety for our store teams and our guests. Looking ahead, as you'll hear from both Christina and John, our team is focused on moving forward and preparing for the biggest seasons of the year. And given the current consumer and economic backdrop, we've adjusted our guidance for the remainder of the year, consistent with a cautious planning approach that has served us so well during the first half of the year. Against this cautious backdrop, our team is laser-focused on delivering newness, quality and affordability, reinforced by a commitment to retail fundamentals. Given the rapid growth and the volatility our business has experienced over the last several years, we have an opportunity to refocus our team on 4 key factors that determine where consumers choose to shop: Being reliably in stock; highlighting affordability throughout our assortment, presentation and marketing; leveraging the proximity of our stores to the guests we serve; while ensuring a seamless differentiated, easy and inspiring guest experience on every trip, every day. These areas have always been a source of strength, and we want to ensure we continue to differentiate our experience from our competitors. Within our merchandising, we'll continue to invest in our industry-leading owned brand portfolio, along with the expansion of key national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Levis, Apple and Disney. We'll focus on deepening the relationship with over 100 million Target Circle members and leveraging the power of our Roundel ad business to integrate relevant offers and promotions throughout the fall. And we'll continue to drive awareness of our industry-leading Drive-Up service and highlight the recent addition of new guest-focused options, including Drive-Up returns and the ability to have a Starbuck beverage delivered with your order. Of course, we'll also continue to invest in our physical assets to position us for continued future growth. But the bulk of these investments are happening in our stores as we add new locations, complete full store remodels, enhance the efficiency of our same-day services and add new locations for our Ulta Beauty partnership, Disney store concept or enhanced Apple experience. In the supply chain, we're continuing to invest in upstream replenishment capabilities, along with the expansion of our network of sortation centers, which deliver meaningful savings while increasing the speed of our last-mile delivery. So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take stock of where our business is today. And I think it's helpful to pull back the lens because 2023 is the fourth year in a row in which the external backdrop has been far different from anything we've ever experienced. Yet today, as a result of our team's consistent efforts to listen, understand and serve our guests, Target is a much different company than it was 4 years ago. We have the right strategy, guest relevance and team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Through the first half of 2023, our total revenue of just over $50 billion was about 39% higher than the $36 billion we delivered in 2019. This growth reflects significant increases across our entire business in all 5 merchandising categories in both our stores and digital channels and in our Roundel ad business. And this growth reflects an increase in guest engagement, as measured by the number of visits they're making to Target. And today, despite the challenges we faced in recent quarters, the number of guest trips through the first half of 2023 was more than 169 million higher or more than 21% higher than in 2019. Our team delivered this growth during a time of exceptional uncertainty and volatility. I want to end my remarks by acknowledging that accomplishment. And I also want to recognize the team members in our stores and distribution centers for the way they quickly responded to the recent and unexpected slowdown in our top line sales trends. It's because of their discipline and agility that we've continued to provide an outstanding shopping experience while delivering better-than-expected profitability so far this year. On behalf of all our stakeholders, I want to thank our entire team for their continued extraordinary efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Christina.A. Christina HenningtonThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the multiple headwinds we were faced on the top line, there were a number of things to like in the second quarter. Of the many notable bright spots, our team's agile execution in service of our guests and each other rises to the top. Consumers continue to face difficult choices with every purchase. Whether managing their budgets in the face of higher prices or planning for resuming student loan payments, our guests are facing multiple ongoing challenges. With inflation rates moderating, however, we've started to see consumer confidence begin to recover from recent lows. And while we're maintaining an appropriately cautious outlook today, we're hopeful that conditions can improve with time. In the meantime, even as consumers continue to spend with caution, our guests continue to embrace newness and seasonally relevant moments, all with an unwavering focus on affordability. In the second quarter, comparable sales were down 5.4%, softer than our expectations coming into the quarter. Frequency categories continue to grow, partially offsetting the softness we saw in discretionary categories. Essentials &amp; Beauty grew in the mid-single digits, led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the low double digits. Within our Beauty offering, core Beauty delivered double-digit growth while sales from Ulta Beauty at Target more than doubled compared with a year ago, showing why we're so enthusiastic about this exclusive partnership. Food &amp; Beverage sales were in the low single digits, and we saw particular strength in snacks, candy and beverages. Conversely, discretionary categories softened further from recent trends, with Apparel, Home and Hardlines all seeing comp declines in the low double digits to mid-teens in the second quarter, several percentage points softer than in the first quarter. Even as trends in these categories remain quite soft overall, there are pockets of newness that are working quite well, and we're doubling down on investments in those areas. For example, our Entertainment business within Hardlines continues to see healthy growth in the mid-single digits, driven by newness in books and renewed growth in vinyl records. With that in mind and knowing how our guests can't get enough of Taylor Swift, we proactively secured an exclusive vinyl offering that Swifties bought in droves. Additionally, in Home, we've seen incredible demand for Stanley tumblers and cups. So we worked in partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines to add exclusive new colors to the line as part of our beloved owned brand, Hearth &amp; Hand, found only at Target. As you heard from Brian, we anticipated some of the headwinds at play throughout the second quarter. including the continued pullback in discretionary spending. Other headwinds were incremental, including the strong reaction to this year's Pride assortment. Our goal is for our assortment to resonate broadly and deliver on the Target brand promise. In this case, the reaction is a signal for us to pause, adapt and learn so that our future approach to these moments balances celebration, inclusivity and broad-based appeal. As we move ahead, we're confident that if we stay close to our guests, consistently execute on our retail fundamentals and continue investing in our assortments, services and experiences, we will position Target for continued growth over the long term. After all, as a guest-led company, we have been listening to and learning from our guests for decades. As an example, last year, we heard loud and clear that Target Circle members love exclusive events. So we repurposed last year's Deal Days and made our Target Circle Week in July bigger than ever with incremental promotions and new ways to engage. In fact, we enrolled well over 0.5 million new guests during this event alone, more than 3.5x higher than in an average week. Additionally, Beauty guests told us for years how they would love the convenience of completing their beauty trip with access to prestige beauty products while shopping at Target. This led to the development of a unique partnership with Ulta Beauty to meet those needs. And today, based on the strong results we've seen so far, we continue to expand the footprint of these new shop-in-shops. When our guests, who already love our Drive-Up service, told us that they wanted us to add Starbucks and the ability to make returns, we quickly built, piloted and are now rolling out those capabilities across the chain, and we're seeing incredibly high Net Promoter Scores from our guests. And well before the recent release of the long-awaited Barbie Movie, we collaborated with our vendor partners to secure exclusive items across multiple categories while adding a splash of pink style for Barbie fans of all ages. Barbie, along with Disney's The Little Mermaid, are the most recent examples of our long record of success in securing timely, relevant product lines supporting key movie licenses across toys, apparel, home, beauty and food, which have allowed us to consistently capture between 30% and 60% market share with these properties. While we continue to take a conservative inventory position overall, these examples show that we are still leaning into key opportunities. We know our guests want to celebrate culturally and seasonally relevant moments, and we'll be leaning into those moments in a big way in the third quarter and the upcoming holiday season. And our guests have told us that affordability; availability; and easy, convenient and consistently joyful shopping experience are more important than ever. While I've shared in prior calls that we're always focused on retail fundamentals, we're further sharpening our focus on 4 key aspects: Comprehensive affordability, in-stock levels, leveraging our proximity to our guests and the overall shopping experience. For a great example look no further than our Back-to-School and Back-to-College assortments. We know our guests are approaching Back-to-School with a value-conscious, deal-driven mindset, so we're leaning into savings for teachers and college students, including our 20% off Teachers Appreciation and Student Savings events. We're also featuring ultra low everyday prices all season long, with school supplies starting as low as $0.25, and key items such as lunch boxes and graphic tees at compelling $5 price points. And just in time for Back-to-School, we're launching new Good &amp; Gather products, including an assortment of new lunchbox-sized items. Back-to-College is always a big season for Target. This year, we're leaning into affordability as well as proximity to college-bound students. This includes strategic inventory bets and allocations in key markets where there are the greatest market share opportunities to ensure we're in stock and ready to play offense during this critical season. Of course, affordability goes well beyond a single season like Back-to-School. In fact, with many consumers making their decisions on where to shop based on affordability, we're highlighting the comprehensive value we provide through our $30-plus billion owned brand portfolio. For example, Threshold, our flagship owned brand in Home, just received a major facelift. With new branding, stronger price points and a clarified aesthetic to help guests mix and match affordable styles for their homes, this beloved brand will be even easier to love. And just in time for the holidays, we'll be launching new owned brands while expanding others, including the launch of a new kitchenware line that will make everyday meal prep easier while offering incredible quality and durability. Look for lots of newness on store shelves and online later this Fall. As John will cover in more detail, we continue to invest heavily in our in-store experience, which starts with new stores and remodels that incorporate our latest and greatest offerings, including Apple, Levi's and Disney experiences, as well as the additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. And just like we remodel our stores to reflect our latest thinking and guest feedback into the shopping experience, we'll begin rolling out a remodel of our digital experience this quarter. Based on guest feedback, we're investing to create a digital experience that enhances the love of discovery while balancing the ease of navigation. This will include different landing experiences, more personalized content, enhanced search functionality, ease of navigation and other updates to bring more joy and convenience to our digital guests. Through it all, our teams continue to exhibit a commitment to excellence in the pursuit of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. Regardless of the external environment, our team consistently shows up and rises to the moment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside such a talented team. Thank you for all you do to bring that Target magic to life day in and day out. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John J. MulliganThanks, Christina. Like Brian and Christina, I want to start by thanking our amazing team. This quarter's better-than-expected profitability was a testament to their agility and resilience as they successfully managed through multiple challenges. And while the team deserves credit for this performance, they got an assist from this year's leaner inventory position which offered more room to maneuver than a year ago when the team was dealing with excess inventory. This year, with unclouded facilities, a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and our continued work to enhance efficiency, the team delivered an impressive increase in profitability in the face of a challenging top line. Across the entire supply chain, we're benefiting from much more favorable conditions than a year ago. Perhaps most notable is in global shipping, where second quarter import lead times were nearly 30 days shorter than last year and within a couple of days of pre-pandemic levels. In our domestic supply chain, because of strong partnership with our vendors, we're seeing improvement on multiple performance metrics, including fill rates and on-time arrivals. And at our regional distribution centers, inbound backlogs have been reduced by more than a day since last year.In the new flow centers we've opened over the last couple of years, we're also seeing improvements across multiple performance metrics as these new buildings continue to scale up towards capacity. In support of their primary role in replenishing store inventory, these facilities were designed and equipped to support our stores as hubs strategy with newly developed automation that can assemble customized, presorted and sequence shipments for every store they serve. With these shipments, stores see faster replenishment times, require less labor to unload a trailer and maintain lower levels of backroom inventory. More precisely, stores being serviced by these new facilities have seen a 20% reduction in lead times, enabling them to respond more quickly to changes in guest demand. Also notable, stores serviced by these new facilities are benefiting from improvements in in-stock levels while maintaining lower levels of backroom inventory.Beyond store replenishment, we're operating these new flow centers in a way that's unique within the industry. In the same way we pioneered ways to leverage the proximity, inventory and assets in our stores to quickly and efficiently fulfill digital orders, we're leveraging those same characteristics of our flow centers to fulfill certain digital orders beyond their primary role in replenishing store inventories.In light of our focus on retail fundamentals throughout the supply chain, our stores are seeing meaningful improvements in their in-stocks, even with 17% lower inventory on our balance sheet than a year ago. In the second quarter, overall in-stocks were a full percentage point better than first quarter and more than 2 points better than last year. We've seen even bigger improvements on our top items and in our top stores. And this year, we sat with meaningfully better in-stocks on key seasonal programs, including Back-to-School and Back-to-College, than we saw a year ago.Our new sortation centers are delivering outstanding results. These facilities operate downstream from our stores and help to increase the speed and efficiency of last-mile delivery. Up to 70% of the packages processed by these facilities stay in the local market, allowing us to partner with Shipt to handle the last mile. This integration with Shipt allows us to achieve meaningful efficiency and cost savings while offering much greater speed of delivery to our guests.More specifically, in markets where we operate a sortation center, the average click-to-deliver time is nearly 1.5 days shorter than the network average, with about 1/3 of the packages arriving in only 1 day. As we continue to open new buildings and test and iterate on their operating model, we expect these speed metrics will continue to improve in the future.Today, based on the proven success of this strategy, we have 10 sortation centers already operating and expect to open at least 6 more over the next few years. This current group of sortation centers is expected to process more than 35 million packages in 2023, representing a more than 20% increase from a year ago and a more than sixfold increase from 2021. As I described in our call 3 months ago, store teams this year have been focused on reinforcing best practices that support the retail fundamentals Christina highlighted earlier. In particular, this year, we've been investing to provide incremental training and reporting on several key factors that play a critical role in providing a great shopping experience, including staffing and scheduling; setting, filling and replenishing merchandise presentations; and protecting the safety of our guests and our team. Throughout this year, our store teams have been progressing through a strategically sequenced training program designed to reinforce these best practices at key moments, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. The goal is to provide an elevated, consistent experience every day in every store across the country. Since we've rolled out this training, we've seen broad-based improvement on performance metrics tied to critical guest outcomes, including pricing accuracy, locating items for digital orders and setting key seasonal programs more quickly and completely. And in support of the goal of achieving greater consistency in the level of execution across our nearly 2,000 stores, we've implemented a new rapid response process to help individual locations recover more quickly when they begin to see a decline in key metrics. Also in stores, as Christina mentioned, we are really pleased with the early results from nationwide rollout of Drive-Up returns and the ability to add a Starbucks order to a Drive-Up trip. We've long said that Drive-Up receives the highest satisfaction rating of any service we provide. And as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we continually push ourselves to find new ways to further differentiate Drive-Up. And when we ask our guests how we could do that, they told us that adding Starbucks and taking returns were at the top of their list.To ensure that we could consistently execute on these new services while maintaining the high bar we've attained for satisfaction, we applied a disciplined test-and-iterate approach to the rollout, beginning with small-scale tests in the second half of 2022. Following a successful test of Drive-Up returns, we launched the service nationwide in April and May, and the results have been outstanding. Once a guest arrives at a Drive-Up lane, the average wait time for a team member to process their return is within 3 minutes, consistent with our standards for a traditional Drive-Up order. As we began testing the addition of Starbucks to Drive-Up, and given the complexities of making and promptly delivering a hot or cold beverage after our guest arrives, we wanted to put the process through an intensive period of testing and refinement. And today, based on what we've learned during the test period, we're confident we can scale up this service while consistently maintaining our service standards. As a result, we're currently in the process of rolling out Starbucks at Drive-Up nationwide and plan to complete the rollout by the end of October, just in time for pumpkin spice latte season.So now before I finish my remarks, I want to provide a brief update on this year's new store openings. As you know, we plan to open about 20 new locations this year, ranging in size from 20,000 to 137,000 square feet. In the second quarter, we completed and opened another 5 new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 11.Highlight of our second quarter projects was the opening of our first new offshore location since 2021, a new store in the Oahu Windward Mall, bringing our store count in Hawaii up to 9. At 132,000 square feet and featuring a Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, CVS, Snack Bar and 18 Drive-Up stalls, this is one of the largest stores we'll open in 2023. And I'm happy to say that it had one of the strongest openings of the year, reflecting outstanding execution by our team. Like our other stores in Hawaii, this new location is expected to be one of the most productive in the chain. And during its first week, it generated the second-highest sales volume out of the most recent 175 stores we've opened.I also want to pause and acknowledge the devastating wildfires that hit Maui in Hawaii. Thankfully, members of our team there are safe, though some have lost homes, had to evacuate or are providing shelter for family and friends. Our nearby stores remain open, helping guests to get much-needed essentials while donating masks and other emergency supplies. In addition, Target has announced a $1 million donation to help national and local disaster partners, and our team member giving fund is collecting donations from team members across the country to help their colleagues impacted by these wildfires.So as I turn the call over to Michael, I want to end with where I started and highlight the tireless efforts of the best team in retail. The last 4 years have been anything but business as usual, and through it all, our team has consistently maintained their focus on what matters most: Taking care of our guests and taking care of each other. I couldn't be more proud to work alongside them and learn from them every day.That, I'll turn it over to Michael.Michael J. FiddelkeThanks, John. As John just mentioned, our team and operating model continue to navigate through a host of challenges on the top line, but our business is showing its resilience. More specifically, we're really pleased with the strength of our second quarter profit performance, which further validates the cautious planning approach and lean inventory position we've maintained throughout the year. This positioning, combined with our continued efficiency efforts, allowed us to make meaningful progress toward our profit recovery goals even in the face of softer-than-expected sales, giving us further confidence that our strategy is sound, we have the right team and our business is positioned for continued progress in the years ahead.Total revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter. Total sales also decreased by that same amount while other revenue grew 1.3%. Within other revenue, we continue to see strong growth from our Roundel ad business, which offset declines in credit card profit sharing and other small income items compared with last year. Comparable sales were down 5.4% in Q2, reflecting a 4.8% decline in traffic. Among the factors affecting our top line performance, comps and discretionary categories continue to reflect challenging trends in the industry, which softened further in Q2. A second factor was lower inflation in food, beverages and essentials as we compare to over peak inflation a year ago. Furthermore, traffic and top line trends were affected by the reaction to our Pride assortment, which launched in the middle of May. And lastly, our results reflected the comparison over last year's clearance and promotional activity, which affected weekly comp trends in certain categories, particularly in the digital channel. While each of these factors played a role in the quarter, it's not possible to reliably quantify the separate impact of each one.In terms of the monthly cadence in Q2, comp sales in May were down a little more than 3%, moved down to a decline of just over 7% in June, then made an encouraging recovery to minus 5% in July. Monthly traffic followed a similar cadence and actually recovered a bit faster than sales in July. Even with unexpectedly soft sales, inventories remain very well controlled. At the end of the second quarter, balance sheet inventory was 17% lower than a year ago. This reflects our cautious planning approach, the agility of our team in responding to softer sales trends and the benefit of a faster global supply chain which enabled shorter lead times. Among our merchandising categories, discretionary inventory was down 25% at the end of Q2, partially offset by increases in our frequency categories and strategic investments and long-term share opportunities. Importantly, as John mentioned, even with much leaner inventories, we've seen meaningful in-stock improvements across our network. We were really pleased with our second quarter gross margin performance, which was enabled by our ongoing work to navigate this volatile environment. Our Q2 gross margin rate of 27% was 5.5 percentage points higher than a year ago. This increase reflects multiple benefits within merchandising, including lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, along with the benefit of lower freight and transportation costs.Beyond merchandising, we also saw about 0.5 point of benefit in digital fulfillment and supply chain due to a lower mix of digital sales and a favorable mix of same-day services within the digital channel. Offsetting these benefits was a 90 basis point headwind from inventory shrink, in line with our expectations.One note. Consistent with the first quarter, category mix did not affect our gross margin rate compared with last year, and we saw a similar deceleration across all 5 of our core merchandising categories between Q1 and Q2 of this year.Our second quarter SG&amp;A expense rate was 1.7 percentage points higher than last year. This increase reflects the deleveraging impact of lower sales, combined with the impact of higher costs, including continued investments in paying benefits for our team and inflationary pressures throughout our business. These pressures were partially offset by disciplined cost management across our team.On the D&amp;A expense line. The Q2 rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales on a 3.9% increase in dollars. Altogether, our Q2 operating margin rate of 4.8% was about 4x higher than last year, reflecting a meaningful recovery from last year's inventory actions. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.80 was significantly higher than last year and above the high end of our guidance range. While we expected to see a big improvement in profitability this quarter, I can't emphasize enough the importance of our team's agility in delivering this performance, something that's even more notable given that shrink drove nearly a full point of profit pressure versus last year.Now I want to turn briefly to capital deployment and start with our priorities, which have served us well for decades. First, we fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash through share repurchase over time within the limits of our Middle A credit ratings. So far this year, we've made capital expenditures of $2.8 billion and continue to expect full year CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. In the second quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends compared with $417 million last year, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend. And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q2 as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our Middle A credit ratings. And we're encouraged by the progress we've already made, as the combined benefit of a significant profit recovery and lean inventory position have driven a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated $3.4 billion in cash through the first half of this year compared with a slightly negative number through the first half of last year. I'll end my comments on the quarter with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures our current profit performance in the context of our long-term investments. For the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 13.7%. While still healthy in absolute terms and more than 2 percentage points higher than the first quarter, it remains well below the level where we expect to operate over time. Now I'll turn to our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of the year. And today, as we assess the economic and industry backdrop, we continue to see a mixed picture. On the positive side, GDP, employment and overall consumer spending have been resilient, and we're beginning to see a recovery in consumer confidence. On the other side of the ledger, while we're happy to see inflation rates begin to moderate, that's likely to cause some near-term pressure on dollar comps in our frequency categories. In addition, the upcoming resumption of student loan repayments will put additional pressure on the already strained budgets of tens of millions of households. Against this backdrop, we remain cautious in our planning, an approach that has served us really well so far this year. On the top line, we're now planning for comparable sales in a wide range centered around a mid-single-digit decline for the remainder of the year, consistent with what we experienced in July and the second quarter overall. This updated sales expectation is meaningfully softer than our expectation at the beginning of the year. With this change in the top line, we've also adjusted our bottom line guidance and now expect full year GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $7 to $8 range compared with our prior range of $7.75 to $8.75. While multiple factors will determine where our actual results wind up in comparison to this expected range, the single most important variable will be the pace of our sales as we're confident we'll continue to benefit from our efficiency efforts and lean inventory position. In the third quarter, we're expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.20 to $1.60 on a wide range of comparable sales centered around a mid-single-digit decline. In terms of quarterly EPS cadence, I want to take note of a couple of unique circumstances this year. The first is shrink and how that is expected to play out over the next 2 quarters. As I mentioned earlier, based on the high loss rates we're continuing to see, second quarter shrink was consistent with our expectations, and our full year shrink expectations remain unchanged. However, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will look meaningfully different between Q3 and Q4. In Q3, we expect the dollar and rate pressure from shrink will be roughly consistent with the first half of the year at around 90 basis points. However, in Q4, we expect to see a small amount of year-over-year favorability from shrink. I want to stress that this anticipated change in quarterly comparisons does not reflect an expectation that underlying loss rates will begin to improve in Q4. As Brian mentioned, we're working hard, both inside our stores and with government and community partners, to achieve lower loss rates over time. And our long-run expectation is that shrink rates will moderate from today's unsustainable levels. But so far, we've only seen indications that loss rates might soon be reaching a plateau, but have not yet seen evidence that loss rates will begin to come down. So the only reason for the expected change in year-over-year comparisons is the cadence of how shrink was recognized by quarter in the back half of last year, a period when loss rates increased rapidly, resulting in higher shrink accruals at year-end. Because we've seen more consistent loss rates in 2023, quarterly accruals have been more consistent throughout this year. Another important consideration is that 2023 is a 53-week accounting year, so the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that the extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and results in about 30 basis points of operating margin leverage on the quarter. I'll note that the extra week will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length. As I get ready to end my remarks, I want to add my thanks to the entire Target team. From the flexibility they built into our business plans, to their responsiveness in the face of this quarter's top line volatility, and their continued work to enhance our long-term efficiency, they're clearly demonstrating their amazing resilience and showing why we're confident that we work with the best team in retail. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.Brian C. CornellBefore we turn to your questions, I want to pause and reinforce why we're so confident in our long-term prospects, which position us for profitable growth in the years ahead. Retail is an ongoing journey: The continuous process of listening to consumers and rapidly evolving to meet their preferences. To do that well, you need to have the right assets in place which allow you to quickly evolve as your guests' wants, needs and preferences change. And we're proud of the way we have built and strengthened Target's assets over the last decade. During this time, we pioneered and built a unique stores as hubs model and invested in new supply chain capabilities to support that model. We invested billions of dollars in our existing store base, modernizing their shopping experience while optimizing those facilities to support digital fulfillment. We opened new locations in markets that had never been served by a Target store, and we continue to evolve our new store design. We developed and launched industry-leading same-day services, which received some of the highest guest satisfaction ratings of anything we do. Within our assortment, we innovated to make our Food and Beauty businesses even stronger and gained huge amounts of market share along the way. We built an even stronger portfolio of industry-leading owned brands which today generate more than $30 billion in annual sales. We also strengthened our portfolio of national brand partners with Ulta Beauty as the most recent example. At the same time, we developed and launched our Roundel ad business, which leverages the power of our guest base and vendor relationships, to deepen the bond between our guests, our vendors at Target. We also built and launched Target Circle, which has quickly become one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States, providing us with even deeper insights about our guests and how we can serve them. And finally, we invested in our team, the best team in retail, by rapidly increasing their hourly wages and the benefits we provide while building stronger pathways to career development and advancement and designing operational processes to enhance their safety and job satisfaction. With all of these assets in place today, we're not standing still. We're uniquely prepared to navigate into the future, including any uncertainties we'll face. We're committed to carefully listening to our guests and to our team and continuing to invest in capabilities and assets that will best serve our guests, even as their wants and needs and expectations evolve from where they are today. Since no one knows what the future will bring and when new opportunities and challenges will arise, the company's best position to thrive over time are the ones with the tools to adapt. And with our stores, our brands, and our vendor partners, our capabilities and our great team, we have everything we need to deliver long-term growth and success. With that, we'll turn to Q&amp;A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing quarter-to-date. And then if you have any initial reads on what you're seeing with the Back-to-School season.Brian C. CornellMichael, I'm happy to start. Rupesh, obviously, it's very early in the season. But for the first 10 days of August, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. They were very consistent with what we saw in the month of July as guests turn to Target for their Back-to-School and Back-to-College shopping.Michael J. FiddelkeYes. I don't have much to add to that. We knew the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons would be important for us. They always are. Second-biggest seasonal moment for us only next to the holiday season. And it was a season where we expected to have some share opportunities. So like Brian said, 10 days in, so just getting started with the quarter, but we're pleased with what we see so far. And the exciting thing about the balance of the year is we've got a lot of those seasonal moments to come. And we know our business performs so well across all categories in those seasonal moments.Brian C. CornellMichael, the only thing I would add as we think about Back-to-School, and particularly Back-to-College, is we expect the shopping season to extend into September, in fact, throughout the month of September. So we're off to a solid start, it's still very early. But we think this will be a Back-to-School season that extends into September.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhGreat. And then maybe one follow-up question. So at your Analyst Day, you indicated expectations for achieving a 6% operating margin rate as early as FY '24. Just given that weaker top line, is that still in the realm of possibility, of getting up to 6% in your next fiscal year?Michael J. FiddelkeFair question, Rupesh, and one I'm sure we'll come back to over time. Right now, we're laser-focused on delivering a strong back half of the year. We're pleased with the profit recovery we saw in the second quarter. When we headed into this year, the path to 6% was paved with meaningful profit rate improvement in 2023. And I couldn't be more thrilled with the progress the teams are making towards that, as evidenced by the strong profit performance in Q2. And we'll continue to plan cautiously and set the team up for as much agility as possible in the back half of the year. And I would expect that progression on profit to continue through the balance of this year, but more to come at the right time on what we think that long-term trajectory looks like.OperatorOur next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWe wondered if you could talk through gross margins maybe a little bit more. We were curious about how much more markdowns were versus plan given the softness on the discretionary side and some of the merchandising challenges. And what was the offset -- the meaningful offset there?Michael J. FiddelkeYes. Kate, I'm happy to start and welcome, Christina, if you want to add any more color. But the biggest story on the markdown front. I mean, I think we described the promotional environment is rational and really as expected for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, clearly, as you know, Kate, we saw meaningful improvement from last year's excess markdowns and cost to clear inventory. And so as you think about the 5-plus point improvement in margin rate year-over-year, the vast majority of that improvement comes from being cleaner from an inventory respective and saving those costs from last year. And so again, just one more example of, by planning the business cautiously, by positioning with flexibility, and by the team reacting to some of the sales trends we saw in the quarter with urgency, we've been able to keep inventory really clean. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll see as clean of an inventory picture exiting the quarter as we started with, with inventories down 17% in total, down 25% in the discretionary categories. So we feel well managed on the inventory front, and that's showing up with markdowns playing out as expected.A. Christina HenningtonYes, Michael. I wouldn't have a lot to add. We're pleased with the team's agility and we believe that the environment is rational, and we're continuing to build back our profit in light of the circumstances.Katharine Amanda McShaneAnd a follow-up question comes on the heels, I think, of the first question that was asked. But wanted to get a little bit more detail about any changes in consumer behavior within the discretionary categories, especially as traffic got better into July? And just how you're thinking of the discretionary categories in the back half of the year.Brian C. CornellYes. Kate, I think we've continued to see the same trends over really the last year now. Well, I think we see a very resilient U.S. consumer, and I think so much of that is fueled by the strength in the labor market. We continue to see a consumer who is facing high inflationary pressure in Food &amp; Beverage and Essential categories that's absorbing a bigger portion of their wallet. I think as they think about discretionary spending, we've seen a rotation in their wallet from goods into services. You're seeing the uptick in travel and leisure, what's happening in entertainment. So those trends, we expect to continue into the back half of the year. We'll watch it carefully. I think our inventory position allows us the ability to chase into demand, and we'll be ready when we see demand changing as we enter the holiday season. But I think the consumer is still taking a very cautious approach to discretionary spending in the goods sector.OperatorOur next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenRegarding traffic, what's your forecast for traffic that's embedded in guidance? Do you expect it to continue to be in the negative low or negative mid-single-digit range? Also, as we dive a little deeper into the discretionary product assortment, what do you see as opportunities in apparel? And how are you thinking about your overall private label assortment in terms of rebalancing and/or the portfolio relative to non-private label?Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to talk about some of the plans we have in place for the back half of the year, some of the newness we have in our assortment, and some of the exciting new changes we're going to make from an owned brand standpoint?A. Christina HenningtonYes, I'd be happy to. So Oliver, thanks for the question. On the discretionary portfolio, we continue to build our assortment strategy for the long term. We fully believe in our multi-category portfolio, that it offers us an ability to meet the guests' needs in a variety of different times. At the moment, given where the consumer is spending, we're, of course, leading on the strength of our Food &amp; Beverage portfolio and Essentials &amp; Beauty, with Beauty really being a highlight with double-digit growth both in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as our core business. Within discretionary, what we're seeing is that there are things that are very much working around newness and innovation. And as you pointed out, our owned brand portfolio plays a huge role in delivering against those goals. We design, we create, we source, we build assortments that -- where we can control a lot of those elements. And we've introduced a lot of newness whether you think about, even in the last quarter, taking advantage of the hot trend with family tumblers and introducing that and embedding that in Hearth &amp; Hand. We have just relaunched our own brand, Threshold, which is our signature Home brand, with updated aesthetics and great price points and new branding. We continue to lean on opportunities. You'll see us launch a kitchenware brand later this quarter, which we're really excited about for its value, but incredible quality and durability. But beyond those opportunities to introduce innovation, it's really taking advantage of the opportunities where guests can do more in one store at Target, and that happens during those seasonal times, where we can leverage both the strength of Food &amp; Beverage as well as Home or Apparel to complete the trip. And Back-to-School, Back-to-College, as Michael mentioned, is a terrific time for us to showcase the strength of our portfolio. So we'll keep doing what we're doing. We're leaning into different categories, but we're planning appropriately so that we can be responsive in the market.Michael J. FiddelkeAnd Oliver, on traffic, as you know, we don't break out a separate traffic forecast. And so kind of the build that goes into our top line guide is embedded in all the things that underlie it. But a couple of thoughts that, one, I'll just reiterate from my comments. We were pleased with the sequential improvement in July in the quarter, and we saw traffic improve at a slightly faster rate than dollars did as we saw that improvement. And then if you zoom all the way back out, versus 2019, if you look at the first 6 months of this year compared to 2019, I mean, we've got almost well over 20% higher traffic coming to our business than we were pre-pandemic. That translates to 170 million or so more guests interactions with Target in store and online. And so the deeper guest engagement we've built is evidenced by our traffic growth over time, critically important to our prospects going forward.Brian C. CornellI'll try to tie those 2 questions together. During the balance of the year, you'll continue to see us lean into seasonal moments. We know those are very important moments for our guests, those are traffic-driving moments for Target. And to Christina's point, we'll combine great newness with affordability throughout those seasons. If you're in our stores today or looking at target.com, you're seeing us lean into this Back-to-School season with great affordability. We'll continue to do that as we enter the Halloween season, get ready for the holidays, combining that great Target newness with great affordability that meet the needs of our guests. So we'll be cautious as we plan for the back half of the year, but we'll lean into those big seasonal moments where we know the guest expects Target to be there to meet their needs.Oliver ChenBrian, one follow-up. Inclusivity has always been important to Target as well as thinking about stakeholders. What are your thoughts in terms of appealing to the broad array of customers going forward and strategies there, particularly around LGBTQIA+?Brian C. CornellOliver, at the heart of our purpose is our commitment to bring joy to all the families we serve. And that really is all families. So we want to make sure Target is that happy place for all of our guests, a place where they can recharge and enjoy those shopping experiences, and you should expect to see us continue to do that over the years to come.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserThe perception is that Target gained a lot of share over the last few years. And now as its traffic is under pressure, guests are either going elsewhere or Target is losing market share. So what levers can Target pull in order to recapture those who would become disenfranchised or are seeking out value or discretionary goods at other retailers? And how much might it cost to regain those guests that are now shopping elsewhere?Brian C. CornellMichael, I might start by zooming out a bit and kind of looking at our performance over several years. Since the start of the pandemic, we've added over $30 billion of top line growth, a significant increase since 2019. And importantly, that's been driven by an increase in trips and transactions, guests spending more time shopping in our stores. I think the strategy we have in place and have had in place for years will serve us well going forward. We'll continue to make sure we're investing in a great in-store experience. Making sure that we are recommitting to retail fundamentals, which means being in stock every time you shop, providing great affordability, making sure we're leveraging our proximity, providing a great guest experience. That extends into the work we'll do from a fulfillment standpoint. We continue to see our guests turn to Target for same-day services, whether it's Drive-Up or Pick-Up or having something delivered to their home through Shipt. Our owned brand portfolio is now a $30 billion brand portfolio. It's a trusted portfolio of brands that provides great quality and style and affordability. So we'll continue to invest in the strategy that served us so well over the last few years and I believe will continue to serve us well going forward.Michael LasserUnderstood. Our follow-up question is on the operating expense outlook. In light of the traffic declines, presumably, you're adjusting your labor. And on top of that, you're in the midst of harvesting $2 billion to $3 billion of savings over the next couple of years. So can you give us a sense for how your operating dollar growth is going to look in the back half of the year? And are there any onetime factors that are going to benefit your operating expense dollar growth that would not be sustainable moving forward?Michael J. FiddelkeYes, I'm happy to take that one, Michael. I mean, obviously, on the SG&amp;A line, leverage matters. And so the softness we saw in the second quarter showed up in some deleverage on some of those more fixed expenses, especially in an inflationary environment. We still got a fair amount of inflation. And importantly, investments in our team, in wage and benefits on that line as well. But I'll say the team's flexibility in the quarter, not just in SG&amp;A, but across the P&amp;L, was really remarkable. And that starts with well-managed inventories. And we talked about the implications for markdowns on the gross margin line there. But managing inventory well flows across the whole system. I mean, we were heavy last year. That makes us more efficient -- more inefficient in stores when the back rooms are full. It makes us more inefficient in our distribution centers when we're managing a lot of inventory. And so we're seeing the benefits of that cleaner inventories position across the system, and I would expect those benefits to continue. And we've got a team that's really focused on managing costs and expense well in the current environment. And that work on efficiency, to translate the scale gains we've seen over the last few years into a more efficient operation, I would expect that to continue to be fuel in the quarters and years to come on the efficiency front.Brian C. CornellOperator, we have time for one last question today.OperatorOur last question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanI wanted to ask, I don't know the way in which you look at the consumer, whether it's in quintiles or deciles. Can you give us a sense, if you look at the comp that the business is performing, how that spreads across your best customer, your middle customer and then maybe your most occasional customer? And if there's anything we could glean from that and think about how it recovers.Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to share some of the insights we have about the different guests that are shopping our stores today?A. Christina HenningtonYes. I think, obviously, we've seen the -- as Brian talked about, we've seen a rotation in their wallet. And so the guests that are more engaged with our discretionary businesses are now leaning more on into our frequency businesses. But I would tell you a very compelling proof point that came out of the second quarter is how we performed during Target Circle Week. Target Circle Week was Target's opportunity to demonstrate value and give back value to our most loyal customers. This was a shift from prior years, where we did Target Deal Days, and the guests really responded to our actions. In fact, it was our single-largest Target Circle Week ever. We acquired an incremental 500,000-plus guests, which is more than 3.5x the average weeks' acquisition rate, into that loyalty program. A loyalty program, by the way, that already has 100 million members. And so the depth to which we're relating to our guests is going to continue to be fueled by our ability to understand them and serve them uniquely, and Target Circle is one way that we're going to do that.Simeon Ari GutmanAnd then the follow-up, maybe for Michael. If you look at the margin recovery of the business that could happen over, call it, the next year or so, is there anything that stands in the way of it? Meaning if we see comps recover and bounce back, especially that means your signature categories recover, is there any reason why we shouldn't see margins continue along that path? I know you said we'll answer it when we get back to the back half of the year. But is there anything that stands in the way of that margin recovery?Michael J. FiddelkeI think it's the factors we've been talking about for a while now, Simeon. And to see a return to positive comp growth in some of those higher-margin discretionary categories, that would be a welcome benefit to margin, for sure. One of the things we'll need to continue to watch is the pressure we've seen from shortage. If You go back to where we were pre-pandemic, I mean, that is one of the single biggest margin headwinds in the business. And so the path of stabilization, we were pleased to see shortage come in as we forecasted in Q2, but that's still a material headwind on a year-over-year basis, on a 2-year basis. And so I think that will be an important variable to watch going forward as well.Brian C. CornellMichael, on that note, as we wrap up the call today, I certainly want to thank our entire team for their efforts throughout the quarter. I particularly want to recognize our asset protection teams. We've talked a lot over the last couple of quarters about the pressures we've been facing with organized retail crime, and I really appreciate the work that our asset protection teams do each and every day to keep our guests safe, our team safe and allow us to operate safely each and every day. So thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you later this year. That wraps up our second quarter call.OperatorGoodbye.]"

So, to counterattack this effect, consider some inflation-hedging stocks. These stocks do well when inflation increases. In June 2022, U.S. inflation hit a four-decade peak reaching a record 9.1%. Budgets were increasing for consumers and companies’ margins were getting squeezed. However, some leading inflation-resistant stocks performed well during the period. The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (NYSEARCA:INFL), which holds some inflation-hedging stocks, handily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index in 2022. It contains some stocks that benefit as prices of real assets rise. These companies can benefit from rising prices, pass on higher costs or have a low-cost base that enables them to be immune against inflationary pressures. Here are three holdings from the ETF that will hedge your portfolio against inflation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTexas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comAs a royalty energy company that owns oil-rich land, Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL) is a play on rising oil prices. Its crown jewel is its land ownership rights on the Delaware Basin in Texas, which accounts for 25% of total horizontal rigs in the U.S. The Texas-based company earns royalties on the oil and gas production made by companies that lease its land. Texas Pacific Land Corporation doesn’t have to replace its reserves as a royalty company. It is a pass-through entity with its lessees making capital investments. Since it doesn’t have to invest in capital expenditure and employees, it has higher profitability than oil exploration and production companies. The minimal operating and capital expenditures also lead to higher cash flows. And when oil prices increase, those increases flow directly to the bottom line. Story continuesDue to these advantages, TPL stock has delivered outstanding fundamentals. Between 2016 and 2022, adjusted EBITDA grew at a 38% compounded annual growth rate. As a result, it has handily outperformed the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas E&amp;P Index. TPL stock presents significant upside. According to their investor presentation in February, only 14% of royalty acreage is developed. As more of its land gets developed, its royalty income will grow.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)An image of tomato plantsSource: HotFlash / Shutterstock.comArcher Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) participates in the global agricultural supply chain and processes various food ingredients. It’s at the heart of what you eat and drink. It’s one of the inflation-hedging stocks that earns a margin on rising food commodity prices. The company doesn’t engage in farming but sources various agricultural commodities. Its agriculture services and oilseeds division originates, transports and stores various agricultural raw materials. It processes oilseeds such as soybeans into vegetable oils and protein meals. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment processes corn and wheat products into different food and beverage ingredients, including corn and wheat starches, syrup, sweeteners, glucose, wheat flour and dextrose. ADM is positioned for growth due to its exposure to food security, health and well-being, and sustainability themes. After all, a growing population needs more food and healthy ingredients. The company benefits from tight supply and demand in agricultural commodities since it charges higher prices. This agricultural commodities giant has been feeding the world for decades and will continue to do so. And the resiliency of its food processing business model has been proven over the years. The company has paid a dividend for 90 consecutive years and raised it for 50 straight years.Franco Nevada (FNV)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockIn an inflationary world, hard assets like gold and silver protect against price increases. That’s why Franco Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is among the inflation-hedging stocks to consider. This Canadian-based company pioneered the royalties and streaming model in 1986, concentrating on gold and silver mines. It doesn’t develop mines. Instead, it pays an upfront cash payment to the company developing the mine. In turn, it obtains the right to receive a portion of future production or revenues. In streaming contracts, it receives streamed physical volumes of specific commodities, whereas in royalty contracts it earns a share of the revenue generated. This strategy allows the company to avoid the substantial capital expenditures, political upheavals and other obstacles miners face in developing resources for production. Additionally, rather than spending enormous upfront costs on one project, it can diversify its investments. Due to this strategy, the company has ended up with a portfolio of 427 portfolio assets. It earns royalties from mining properties developed and run by top producers such as Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), Vale S.A.(NYSE:VALE), Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) and Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW). As of June 2023, 116 of its 427 properties were in production. The rest were in advanced development or the exploration phase. Regarding commodity diversification, gold, silver and oil royalties were 62%, 11% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. The royalty model generates enormous profits for Franco Nevada. For instance, the company achieved an 84% adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022. The company then invests these profits in new assets. Additionally, it pays out a dividend that has increased for 16 consecutive years. If inflation reaccelerates, Franco Nevada is one of the top inflation-hedging stocks in an inflationary environment.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Operator Instructions) Today's call will last 1 hour. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trey Campbell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Trey CampbellThanks, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chair and CEO of Synopsys; Sassine Ghazi, President and COO; and Shelagh Glaser, CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on our website at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart.Story continuesAart J. de GeusGood afternoon. We delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, exceeding the midpoint of all our guidance targets, while reaching another quarterly revenue record. Revenue of $1.487 billion was in the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP operating margin at 35.3%. GAAP earnings per share was $2.17, while non-GAAP earnings per share was above our target range at $2.88. We generated $560 million of operating cash flow and ended Q3 with a backlog of $7.1 billion. By now, you have all seen our other news. So before I address our segment results and outlook, let me warmly welcome Sassine Ghazi to the call. Today, we announced that the Synopsys Board has named Sassine as Synopsys President and CEO starting January 2024, and that I will take the role of Executive Chair of Synopsys Board at the same time. I'm absolutely thrilled with this transition into the CEO role for Sassine. Sassine is uniquely qualified. He is a proven operational leader, a technology innovator and a trusted partner to our customers and ecosystem friends. He is so much more than that. He embodies our values and culture and inspires our company, including me, with his results' focused leadership. Sassine, welcome to your first of many Synopsys earnings calls.Sassine GhaziThanks, Aart. I'm incredibly honored, humbled and profoundly grateful to the board and you, Aart, for placing your unwavering trust in me. You built Synopsys from a disruptive start-up into one of the world's essential semiconductor ecosystem companies. I'm so proud to have been a part of that journey for the last 25 years working with you, our leadership team and the many colleagues across the organization. I'm determined to build upon our strong foundation, drive innovation and propel Synopsys to even greater heights of success. I look forward to engaging with all of you moving forward and to the continuing partnership with Aart.Aart J. de GeusThanks, Sassine. You have my full support. Now let's turn to what we're seeing in the market. Technology industry trends are playing to our strength. The AI-driven Smart Everything era is putting positive pressure on the semiconductor industry to deliver more. Despite economic challenges, semiconductor design starts and R&amp;D investments continue unabated. Our relentless innovation drive has made Synopsys a catalyst for our customers' success in this new growth era for semiconductors. In fact, the market is playing out much as we expected when we planned the year and we are executing accordingly. Based on continued strong design activity, our high confidence in our business, we are raising our full year revenue guidance range to between $5.81 billion and $5.84 billion. We are increasing our year-over-year non-GAAP op margin improvement expectation to 200 basis points. This is approximately 0.5 point up versus prior guidance. We are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to between $11.04 and $11.09. Shelagh will give you -- will discuss the financials in more detail. Prior to giving color on our segment results, let me update you on our AI progress. By now, I hope that we all understand that AI can and does and has further potential to unlock massive new productivity gains. So while we continue to embed AI in everything we do, not surprisingly, one consistent question most of you are asking is how we'll monetize our AI leadership? Let me address that question head on to the techonomic lens of product differentiation and business model framework including some early proof points. For AI monetization, we see 3 distinct value streams. First, through our design participation and the explosive growth in demand for AI chips. Second, by pervasively embedding our pioneering AI across our full EDA stack, which we call Synopsis.ai. And third, through AI-driven efficiency transformation as we optimize and automate our own internal workflows. Let's start with AI chips. Use cases for AI are proliferating rapidly, as are the number of companies designing AI chips. Novel architectures are multiplying, stimulated by vertical markets, all wanting solutions optimized for their specific application. Third parties estimate that today's $20 billion to $30 billion market for AI chips will exceed $100 billion by 2030. In this new era of Smart Everything, these chips in turn, drive growth in surrounding semiconductors for storage, connectivity, sensing, A-to-D and D-to-A converters, power management, et cetera. Growth predictions for the entire semi market to pass $1 trillion by 2030 are thus quite credible. We are uniquely positioned to benefit. In the semi ecosystem, Synopsys is the leading EDA provider to AI chip designers. Designers requiring unmatched capabilities in design tools, particularly at the most advanced process nodes. They also need our leading interface IP portfolio as AI chips are banking on enormous amounts of data, driving new, faster and lower power interconnect protocol. Synopsys excels at this. In summary, AI chips are a core value stream for Synopsys, already accounting on a trailing 12-month basis for well over $0.5 billion. We see this growth continuing throughout the decade. Let's move to our second value stream, Synopsys.ai. This is where starting 2017, Synopsys, incidentally led by Sassine, pioneered AI-driven chip design, and we have relentlessly advanced the state-of-the-art ever since. Using our AI to automate entire design sub flows, our customers report schedule reductions from months to weeks while simultaneously also achieving better results in terms of speed, power and area of the chips. In February, we reported that our customers had passed 100 commercial tape-outs using our AI. Today, the tally crossed 270 as adoption continues rapidly. 9 out of 10 of the top semiconductor vendors are using Synopsys AI in production, and the tenth one is already testing our solution. What makes this doubly relevant is that the worldwide semi industry has a significant resource shortage. Third parties estimate a design engineering gap of between 15% to 30% by 2030. Even the multiplicity of national chip act recognizes this, and AI and design automation will be critical to help bridge the gap. That's why the industry's first AI-driven full EDA suite, Synopsis.ai, comes in. Initially launched in 2020 for design optimization, we have since added AI-driven test and verification flows now in commercial adoption. Usage is expanding rapidly as customers are seeing stunning results. In the last quarter, our customers have demonstrated up to 10x faster turnaround time and double-digit improvements in verification coverage. Customers are also reporting more than 20% silicon test cost reduction. Recently, we engaged Synopsys.ai for analog and custom design. One of our top customers used our AI optimized Custom Compiler to achieve a 6% performance improvement over manually transit custom circuit. Further completing our Synopsys.ai stack, more AI-driven manufacturing flow extensions are coming soon. But back to economics. Synopsys.ai revenue is just starting to ramp, but early proof points give us high confidence in its long-term growth prospects. We've moved from project-based experimentations to customers now adding Synopsys.ai subscription. Synopsys.ai has driven more than 20% value increases in several recent digital implementation renewals often leveraging significant growth for the underlying core tools used by Synopsys.ai. This quarter, we saw multiple full-flow displacements to Synopsys.ai, driven by up to 10x productivity differentiation versus the competition, which brings me to generative AI. Over our history, key disruptive technologies have catalyzed innovation opportunities for Synopsys to deliver leaps in productivity. Gen AI is such a technology. Anchored in 35-plus years of experience in developing model-based solutions now with unparalleled data assets portfolio, we intend to harness Gen AI capabilities into Synopsys.ai. We see this delivering further advances in design assistance, design exploration and design generation. On the design flow spectrum from optionality to optimality, in other words, moving from many options in early architectures to highly tuned error-free tape-outs, Gen AI techniques will augment the exploration, accelerate design choices and automate some design generation. This will further broaden the intelligence dimensions in our Synopsys.ai. These capabilities represent additional customer value, opening multiple new monetization opportunities. We will elaborate more on our road map in the coming quarters, which brings me to our third monetization value stream, operational efficiency transformation. Gen AI isn't just an opportunity for our customers. We, ourselves, truly intend to eat at our own AI restaurant, so to speak. We see significant operational efficiency and automation potential and processes across the company so that our employees can focus on higher ROI tasks. Our experimentation is in full swing, and we are rapidly learning the strength and challenging of these new approaches. Overall, current progress on our AI journey, and it is great to have Sassine on the call for Q&amp;A as he is very focused on our AI business strategy and monetization. Let me now give some color on our segments of Design Automation at roughly 65% of our business, Design IP at about 25% and Software Integrity at around 10%. Starting with Design Automation, we saw strong revenue momentum and the segment delivered its first $1 billion quarter. Fusion Compiler momentum continues to grow with increased customer share and Synopsys-enabled customers taping out first to a number of leading manufacturing nodes, including TSMC N2 and N5A, Samsung SF3 and Intel 18A. Fusion leadership at advanced node has also translated into key HPC core wins at both semiconductor and hyperscale companies. Transitioning to multi-die chip design, our 3DIC Compiler platform continued momentum across verticals, achieving deployment on the industry's first advanced 3D stacked heterogeneous design for smartphone. We also expanded our multi-die ecosystem enablement, including qualification for leading foundries, latest multi-die flows and support for key 3D design standards. Of note, we deepened our collaboration with Samsung Foundry to accelerate multi-die system design for advanced processes. Let's move to verification, where the need for acceleration is paramount. In Q3, we won a ZeBu hardware-assisted verification engagement who's a risk 5 AI chip provider and so HAPS deployments for prototyping AI chips at a large hyperscaler and a large HPC company. Synopsys Cloud continues to deliver substantial differentiation and time-to-market gains for our customers. Our SaaS solution, which accounts for 70% of our cloud users, continued to gain strong adoption with multiple AI chip start-ups, leading new SaaS deployments. Now turning to Design IP, which is roughly 25% of our revenue. We had an excellent quarter working closely with some of our partners to enable the most advanced process nodes in the design ecosystem. Just this week, Synopsys and Intel announced a very significant expansion of our long-standing strategic partnership in EDA and IP to speed the design and manufacturing of advanced SoCs and multi-die systems for Intel processes. This comprehensive agreement enables Intel's internal IDM 2.0 teams and their external foundry customers to accelerate chip and system design with a powerful portfolio of essential IP developed by Synopsys for Intel 3 and 18A processes. Synopsys IP is now key to ramping and filling multibillion dollar rate for fabs as the advanced node IP supplier of choice of customers and the manufacturing ecosystem. Further supporting this in Q3, we also announced the industry's broadest portfolio of silicon proven IP for TSMC's N3E process as well as an extensive portfolio of IP or all of Samsung Foundry's advanced process technology. In automotive, autonomous driving ADAS systems continued to drive strong demand for our IP. This quarter, we exceeded 30 design wins in 5-nanometer and won our first 3-nanometer design at a marquee automotive OEM. All in all, we have won IP sockets on more than 100 ADAS chips. Third, the Software Integrity segment, which represents 10% of our revenue. Against the continued challenging macro environment for enterprise software, the business delivered solid results. The imperative for security and quality in software has always been critical. And with the rise in Gen AI generated code, big new risks are emerging. Racing forward, we continue to develop innovative new solutions like our AI code analysis API offering on our Polaris SaaS platform. AI code analysis API enables developers to automatically submit code snippets from code assistance such as GitHub copilot and ChatGPT to receive instant feedback on whether the code may originate from risky open source project. In summary, we had outstanding Q3 financial results and operational execution and are confident in our strong close to the year. We are raising our guidance for full year revenue and year-over-year op margin as well as non-GAAP earnings per share expectations. We have a resilient business model and our customers continue to prioritize investments in the chips and systems that position them for future growth. We continue to invest in technology leadership, multi-die design solutions, state-of-the-art IP and the leading edge AI-driven EDA suite to help capitalize this decade of smart, secure and safe products. And last, but certainly not least, I am just delighted to welcome Sassine as our new CEO. I would like to thank our employees and our partners for their passion and commitment. With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh.Shelagh GlaserThank you, Aart. And congratulations, Sassine. I look forward to continuing to partner with you as you transition to CEO and scale the company to the next level of growth. On to results. Q3 was another outstanding quarter with record revenue and earnings. EPS was above the high end of our range. We continue to execute well, which is a testament to our execution and leadership position across our segment, robust chip and system design activity by our customers, who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and with $7.1 billion in noncancelable backlog, the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. With our continued confidence in the business, we are raising our full year targets for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin improvement and EPS. I'll now review our third quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $1.49 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.19 billion. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $963 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 35.3%. GAAP earnings per share were $2.17, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.88. Now on to our segment. Design Automation segment revenue was $1 billion, up 23%, driven by broad-based strength. Design Automation adjusted operating margin was 41.4%. Design IP segment revenue was $350 million, up 12%. Adjusted operating margin was 24.7%. Software Integrity revenue was $133 million, up 12%, and adjusted operating margin was 16.9%. Due to continued macro impact on this segment, we now expect Software Integrity revenue growth in 2023 to be below our long-term guidance of 15% to 20%. Turning to cash. We generated $560 million in operating cash flow and used $300 million for cash for stock buyback. Our balance sheet is very strong. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.8 billion and total debt of $18 million. Now to guidance. As we have previously communicated, we had expected a strong second half. We are again raising our full year outlook for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin improvement and earnings. For fiscal year 2023, the full year targets are: revenue of $5.81 billion to $5.84 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $4.544 billion and $4.564 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.78 billion and $3.79 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 200 basis points; non-GAAP tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $7.85 to $7.96 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $11.04 to $11.09 per share. Cash flow from operations of approximately $1.65 billion. Now to targets for the fourth quarter: revenue between $1.567 billion and $1.597 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.184 billion and $1.204 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $1.005 billion and $1.015 billion; GAAP earnings of $2.17 to $2.28 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $3.01 to $3.06 per share. Consistent with prior years, we will provide additional comments and guidance for 2024 when we report next quarter. In conclusion, we delivered record quarterly revenue and earnings. Based on our outstanding results year-to-date and strong outlook, we are again raising our targets for the full year. We continue to see strong momentum in the business, reflecting our leadership position across our segments, robust design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resiliency of our time-based business model. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Jason Vincent CelinoGreat. Frankly, I don't know where to begin. Aart, what a run. And Sassine, well deserved. And maybe Sassine, sorry to put you on the spot here, but can you just frame your vision around AI and how closely you've been working with the AI strategy?Sassine GhaziSure. First, thank you, Jason. And as Aart mentioned, actually, the AI journey for Synopsys started around 2017. I was the general manager of our EDA business at the time, and no one in our industry was talking about AI in 2017 for EDA applications. Around the 2020 time frame, we actually had customers using it in early production stages. And now as you saw the number, many, many tape-outs. At the time, we started with the design space as the early stage of high impact using AI. And as you have seen us talk about the last couple of quarters with Synopsys.ai, where we're expanding the impact into test, verification, analog custom, manufacturing, et cetera. And Aart mentioned in his remarks that we have customers at this point buying our AI solution as part of their subscription license. And when a customer does that, they already see the value and the impact and they're willing to pay for it. And that's the stage we're in at this point.Jason Vincent CelinoOkay. No, that's great. And then my brief follow-up, I think it was mentioned that in some renewals, you're seeing a 20% increase because of AI. Is this mainly driven from the tools themselves? Or is this more related to the upsell of the core because of the compute?Sassine GhaziI'm sorry, the 20% increase in what? I missed the first part of the question.Jason Vincent CelinoI think Aart mentioned that in some renewals, you were seeing 20% increases in value. I was just curious on the drivers of that? Or maybe I misheard it?Sassine GhaziWe are seeing, yes, absolutely 2 factors. One, there's a pull-through of the technology that our AI system uses, like Fusion Compiler, PrimeTime, et cetera, et cetera. And the customer is adding money -- new money in the agreement based on the AI system that we are selling them. So it's not only an upsell and a pull-through of the license, it's incremental value that the customers are adding to their renewal with Synopsys.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.Gary Wade MobleyCongrats to both Aart and Sassine on the transition.Sassine GhaziThank you.Gary Wade MobleyAnd I just want to pick up where the last discussion point left off. I wanted to maybe probe into maybe how many renewals have come up since you went from on a per design subscription for AI tools to rolling into baseline license renewals. I just want to get a sense of how many of these license renewals are now including AI?Sassine GhaziAs you know, an average EBA contract is about 3 years. So 2021, we started with customers and we have a number of those customers included it in their renewals. So we're already in that first stage with a number of customers, including it in their 3-year contract.Gary Wade MobleyOkay. I wanted to change topics and move to the different trends in the operating margin for the different business segments. I know that you called out in the past, quarter-to-quarter volatility in the op margins for the IP business, but we now have a trend with the trend downwards for the past 2 quarters. So maybe if you can speak to that specific to the IP business. And then conversely, you're showing nice gains in the Software Integrity business with seemingly not much revenue ramp. So maybe you can speak to the under occurrence there and as it relates to OpEx controls in the Software Integrity side?Shelagh GlaserSure. So I think it is -- this is the change that Aart and Sassine drove in the organization. So that's why we've got this more comprehensive segment reporting, and you're able to see what is going on in our 3 large segments. So if I talk about Design IP specifically, we really think about that business on a long-term. And as Aart talked in his prepared remarks, we're building out an IP portfolio for each new node, for each different foundry, for each different customer. So think of us as constantly investing in IP. And when we're signing contracts with customers, we're signing an agreement for a specific amount of dollars with a specific term. And when the customers pull down the IP, it is based on when their design is needing to integrate that IP into the design. So over time, we expect that IP op margin is slightly below our corporate margin. And what you're seeing is what we've always called lumpy, you're able to see what lumpy looks like now with our new segment reporting. So the expectation hasn't changed. And as we're looking out, we are seeing customers deep into their designs, and we understand the timing of when the IP would be pulled down. So we feel strongly about that business. Plus it's an incredible strategic asset for us to be so deeply involved and engaged in our customers design. So we've got a strong view of -- positive view on that op margin. For Software Integrity, we've talked about we've been focused on improving the margins in that business as we scale the business, and you're seeing some of the pull-through for that in Q3 time frame.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe.Joshua Alexander TiltonFirst, Aart, I guess, not a guess, but you'll definitely be missed, and congrats Sassine on the new role.Aart J. de GeusNot like I'm completely disappearing, right? Just to be clear.Joshua Alexander TiltonMore your voice on these earnings calls, it will definitely -- I guess like my first question is just it seems like as of January, we're going to have a bit of a new regime in place. Maybe what are some of the things you can either do differently or just some levers that you feel that you could pull to maybe drive some meaningful margin expansion in the model come next year?Sassine GhaziJosh, I've been part of this company for 25 years, and the last 3 years, it's really been the start of what we call like a momentum journey, and we'll continue that pace of the journey moving forward. What Aart and I -- when I was appointed to COO and then later president, we really set out 3 vectors as priority for the company. The first one is focused on the growth ambition; the second one is scaling and how do we scale efficiently as a company; three, technology leadership and innovation. And if you look at the results, they're really amazing. Over that period of time, we're able to grow revenue 17% CAGR, 700 basis points in non-GAAP operating margin and 26% CAGR EPS. And doing all of this while pioneering industry-first technologies like the AI solutions that we are talking about, plus 3DIC from a multi-die both IT and design tools, et cetera, et cetera. So as we look ahead, January 1, as you commented, it's just the continuity of that pace at a time where the market, the semiconductor chip activity, is so exciting, driven by the AI demand that requires more compute, either data center cloud or edge as well as everything going smart, Smart Everything in a car, in home, in the industry, et cetera. So it's really continuing that pace of momentum we created on all 3 vectors.Shelagh GlaserAnd I would add that we're committed to both short and long-term operating margin improvement. That's what you're seeing the improvement in the second half of the year. We, of course, will guide '24 next quarter, but our long-term guide is at least a 100 basis point improvement in the year. So we're committed to that.Joshua Alexander TiltonSuper helpful. And I think just a quick follow-up that on track. When you guys started buying up all these SIG assets, I think the bullish take was we have this portion of the business that's growing a lot faster than the core EDA, and we could see this nice mix shift effect as SIG becomes a bigger piece of the total pie. But I guess, how do we think about when, from an investor perspective, we should kind of expect SIG growth to be back above the corporate average? Like just maybe help us out with a little color there.Sassine GhaziThe thesis behind SIG remains very strong, which is software quality and security. And actually, right now, you can argue and the future is as strong or stronger with AI-generated code and the need for any developer to ensure that it's secure software that are using in their products. What happened over the last 12 months or so is not unique to Synopsys is you're seeing it in the industry, especially at the software enterprise industry, is a slowdown and that headwind is really what you're seeing right now. And as Shelagh mentioned, even though we're not speaking about long-term projection and guidance for any part of the business, but we are -- last quarter, if you recall, we said we'll be at the lower end of the 15% to 20%, and now it will be slightly below that number, but it's not due to the portfolio or the execution, it's truly the headwind we're facing in the market.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Joe Vruwink with Baird.Joseph D. VruwinkGreat. Congrats Sassine and Aart. I maybe wanted to start just Aart, in your opening comments, the 3 sources of monetizing AI chips and that market opportunity that's more market growth for customers. Your AI products, that's wallet share for Synopsys and then how you can employ AI internally? I take that as meaning higher margins. I guess when you just add all of those things together, can you maybe comment on how it could start to influence your long-term financial framework because a lot of these things we're certainly early days or not as present back in 2021 when the framework was first debuted?Aart J. de GeusWell, you have our basic financial outlook because we have communicated that we're focusing on #1 growth and continued gradual improvement of ops margin. And in many ways, this is against a backdrop that is fantastically exciting because there's going to be a wave of end users, and I mean with that system companies that all want to have AI, that all wants to have chips that are way faster, way lower power, way more data. In other words, the entire industry around us will be unhappy with semiconductors because they want more. And there is nothing better than that because that is what in the early days drove the whole Moore's Law at super high growth. And we have a similar feel going on right now. And you may say, well, but is the technology not limited? Well, no, it's not. What has changed is that the architectures are all changing and that the ability to bring chips immensely close together, including stacking them vertically is now suddenly opening up. Still difficult, still expensive. But that's what FinFETs were before to and then suddenly out of nowhere there were over 10 generations of it. And I think this is exactly the space that we've entered. And so that's another way of saying design is going to become more complex, more engineers are needed. And given that the world supply of engineers is somewhat limited, more automation is the only answer to solve this. Again, not any difference than in the '80s, '90s, 2000s and we all feel this drive because the notion of Smart Everything has shown itself as relevant. Now a little portion of that is, well, how smart are we on the inside? And there's a lot that we can learn. And obviously, anything that we can automate or accelerate in our processes directly goes to the bottom line. And at that point in time, Sassine's job is to figure out how much of that money to the bottom line goes directly back into AI research, right? So that circle is very active.Joseph D. VruwinkOkay. That's all great. I wanted to go back, and Jason asked about the renewal anecdote. I think that's a pretty interesting one. I guess my question is the 20%, is that pretty typical or emblematic of what placement route has been seeing so far? And maybe if it is, how do you see renewals evolving as customers get more experience, more proof points on things like test your new AI verification, analog kind of the full Synopsys.ai suite? What could that mean for a typical renewal?Sassine GhaziYes. In the early stages of AI, what the customers were struggling with were 2 things. One, I may not have enough compute; and two, I may not have enough licenses, EDA licenses. On the compute side, there are multiple ways that can be addressed, but most of our customers figure that out given the value that they were able to see. On the EDA side, the reason we started with project-based, we were really trying to figure out with the customers, what's the combination of number of licenses needed for an AI job because AI is pulling far more licenses of the technology that is under the hood compared to an engineering -- individual engineer effort. So after we learned from that experimentation, let's call it, around 2020 and customers wanting to scale it up, we started providing it as part of the subscription license in order to enable broader and easier adoption for the customer. And with that came monetization through Synopsys. As I said, incremental monetization on 2 sides, more selling of the licenses plus selling the AI technology as well. We have now actually many. Still early stages, though, when I say many in terms of renewals, remember, those are 3-year cycles of renewals and 2020 was just around the corner in terms of a renewal cycle. But we have many customers that they have gone through renewing their subscription license with Synopsys and added more technology that's pulling and AI license.OperatorWe will take our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaBest wishes to both Aart and Sassine on your new roles.Sassine GhaziThank you.Vivek AryaSo I had a near and a longer-term question. So on the near-term design IP, when I look year-to-date, if the model is right, your sales are basically flattish so far this year, I think maybe up 1%. So I'm curious, why is it well below your long-term growth expectations? And then when can we see this business get towards your target, which I think is to grow at kind of in a mid-teens annual basis?Shelagh GlaserSo it is a lumpy business, as I described before, the contracts we signed with the customers, we have a term and a dollar amount and then the timing of those pull downs is really based on customer design. So we're -- we're confident in our long-term growth in that business because of the contracts we have signed with customers. But, Vivek, it is lumpy because it's really dependent. We're delivering IP all the time, constantly refreshing and delivering new IP blocks. And then it's really the pull downs are based on the customer design schedule and we see robust tip activity, and we expect customers pull downs over near-term horizon.Vivek AryaAll right. And for my follow-up, I'm trying to think of what is the right way to think about your sales growth for the next 2 to 3 years? Can it stay mid-teens? Will it decelerate, right, to low double digit? Will it accelerate? Because AI is growing, but that's only 10% of your sales. Is that really enough to help Synopsys continue to grow at this mid-teens pace? Because when I look at a lot of the other parts of semis, right, whether it's consumer or parts of industrial, or a traditional data center, they have really slowed down. So I'm curious, is this AI enough to help Synopsys continue to grow its sales at kind of this mid-teens space over the next 2 to 3 years?Aart J. de GeusJust one comment, Vivek, you're asking, of course, a question that you should ask at the end of Q4, right? That's when we give guidance for the coming year. At the same time, overall, as we mentioned, we are in a market that we perceive as strong for us. We don't see any big changes. From year to year, of course, there's variability. But too early to really talk about that. But fundamentally, what we said in preamble is that fundamentally, we have a degree of momentum that shows us that we're in a very strong business at a good time. And so I wouldn't think that there are any major changes, at the same time, again, we're declining -- too far out guidance here.Vivek AryaRight. Without giving guidance, I guess what I'm curious about is your insights on the growth in the business excluding AI because you gave $0.5 billion number over the last 2 months. Your total...Aart J. de GeusYes. Okay. A good point. Sorry, I didn't catch that. Outside of AI, the business is just strong across the board. We talked earlier about IP. These agreements that we made over the last quarter are very powerful for a long period of time, and they establish us as a provider that is one of necessity for foundries to be successful. Remember, for foundry to be successful with a new node, it takes fundamentally 4 things. One, you have to have, of course, the technology. That's their job. Secondly, you need to have the capacity. Third, the EDA tools, which turns out we are always on time. And fourth, you need the collection of IP-ready-to-go because otherwise, the end users can do design and the fact that we have strong agreements to provide this to the leading foundries in the world is fantastic, and that gives us a degree of stability but also potential further growth that is very, very good.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Ruben Roy with Stifel.Ruben RoyMy congrats as well to Aart and Sassine. And Aart, I hope we get to see you planning to get talked more going forward from here.Aart J. de GeusI wait to see you at the gig.Ruben RoyYou'll see me there, definitely. So Sassine, I wanted to ask on AI as well around the sort of how you're viewing the pervasiveness of AI. Aart talked about the $100 billion market potentially in AI chips by the end of the decade and the 10% of $1 trillion semiconductor market. Early days, but do you think for now that AI-embedded tools are slated better for a certain portion of semiconductor design market? Clearly, generative AI design helper mechanism can be pervasive across the entire gamut of semiconductor, I would think. But for now, is that the right way to think about it -- is this kind of large designs with very complicated place in route? Or do you think it will be more pervasive than that?Sassine GhaziIt will be more pervasive than that. But it will definitely be in the stages of design. So if you think of the design as 3 stages, there is the front end of the design then there is the implementation/optimization of the design and the sign-off where we started with DSO.ai is in the physical implementation because of the pace of optimization is so large, it was such a perfect opportunity for an AI system to look at that large space of optimization and find the right parameters to tune and then give you the most optimized physical implementation. But as we expand into test, for example, and reducing the test pattern or verification improving your coverage, analog mixed signal, it's a whole other place where there is plenty of opportunity to innovate in that domain. And you go into manufacturing, they're all time and can leverage AI for both productivity as well as the quality of the result that you get. Now Aart mentioned as well in his script as 3 stages of design assistance, design exploration and design generation. Those -- I want to say some of those are ambitious, meaning this is where we can see the technology heading in the next 1, 2 years at various level of R&amp;D, in some cases, and customer discussions of where do they see the high impact as well as where do we see the technology available today from AI models, et cetera, et cetera. And you can open up the door to how do you protect your IP, the customer IP, how does the system learn. So the opportunity is definitely in early stages in terms of impact of AI overall on the chip design.Ruben RoyVery helpful.Aart J. de GeusIf I may add something because I love what Sassine just said in terms of these opportunities. It is important to understand that what we have done is we started actually with the single hardest problem, which is all the stuff that sits before tape-out. Tape-out is when the design is done and it gets sent to manufacturing. Well, the one thing you don't want to happen is any errors in that. And so as you add more and more and more detail, you're coming to this notion of the absolute necessity to be as close as you can to 0 errors. And that's why, Sassine mentioned, not only the design, but also the verification steps, the sign-off steps and we have integrated all of those under our AI. And I think it's going to take a long time before many of the other techniques get close to that. But we are going to, of course, put those around. So it broadens our opportunity space, as Sassine has said, but the core of our pioneering was really we can do it and get correct chips out. Now that is challenging.Ruben RoyYes, it's a very interesting discussion. I could ask what I hope is a quick follow-up. Some of your semiconductor customers have started to show their own accelerated compute platforms as platforms for EDA tools and in those demonstrations more efficient than current standard server farms running EDA. What's your feeling on that? Do you view that -- obviously, early days, but as additional accelerants to EDA use or semiconductor design activity out there as the overall productivity could get faster as we put some of these new systems in place for your tool?Sassine GhaziYou're right. It's the right observation. Think of it as another tool that you can use to accelerate a workload. We were primarily CPU, then we introduced some GPU acceleration in a number of simulation functions and verification and some other methods. So yes, Ruben, you can think of it that way.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.Jay VleeschhouwerAart, first, I've always enjoyed our more than 100 quarters of dialogue and Sassine, I'm sure you'll look forward to another 100 quarters of multipart questions on the conference call. But for the 2 of you, let me ask a product road map question, and it does relate to AI. As you may recall from your last analyst meeting back in 2019, in answer to a question at the time -- sorry, in answer to a question at the time about what you thought the longevity or useful life of your new data architecture or a new platform might be, having just introduced Fusion on top of it and DC NXT, for example, on top of it, you answered about a decade. And I know it was an approximation. But the question is, do you think that AI, as you embed it in your own products, extends that useful life of that architecture that you introduced a few years ago, or might it on the other hand, require you to accelerate a rebuilding of the architecture as you completed a number of years ago?Sassine GhaziJay, excellent question, and I remember that discussion as well. When we introduced MDM at the time, if you remember, for our digital platform data model, it was around the 2015 time frame. So when you look at the decade, it's right around the corner. We continue -- and that's what's really the primary foundation to build Fusion, where you bring time Fusion Compilers, StarRC, et cetera, the whole digital platform on one unified data model that is helping us accelerate our innovation pace and rhythm because tools are connected and we're able to move much faster in delivering a new technology, new products. And as you can imagine, the team is constantly looking, is there a more efficient new data model that we can build on? And you mentioned the 2019 Investor Day, whereby I spilled the beans. We will have, hopefully, in the first half of '24, it will be great timing to talk about how we see the future given all the very exciting areas of technology innovation and the market around us.Aart J. de GeusWhat he means is an Investor Day.Sassine GhaziWhat did I say, Investor Day?Aart J. de GeusYou didn't say an Investor Day at that time. That's what you meant, right?Sassine GhaziI was too excited.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham.Yu ShiCongrats to Aart. It's really been my great pleasure and honor actually to work with the luminary of the EDA and semiconductor industry as you are. Also congrats, Sassine.Aart J. de GeusI'm blushing.Yu ShiYes. And congrats to Sassine as well. Looking forward to working with you in the future. Maybe my question. I wanted to ask again on the IP revenue. It seems like so far this year, it's been tracking to like single-digit growth this year. It doesn't sound too right because your long-term guidance is kind of like in the mid-teens. Unless are you expecting we get a big bump in Q4? Or are we going to be tracking below that long-term guidance. But maybe next year, we should expect a somewhat above the long-term guidance kind of growth? That will be my first question.Shelagh GlaserYes. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do anticipate a very strong Q4. So our model that we have, we think as well intact, and that's a long-term model. And so when you see the quarter-on-quarter variability, we don't as much manage it in the 90-day increment. We're managing it at the full year and 12 month increments, and we do expect a strong Q4 in IP.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank.Gianmarco Paolo ContiYes. Congrats on another strong quarter and to Sassine. So perhaps starting with SIG, could you explain whether the new go-to-market strategy is bearing some fruits? I actually, I know you've mentioned this before, but maybe can go a little bit more detail into what exactly happened this quarter with regards to the marginal slowdown. Is this simply part of the macro demand that you have previously described? Is there something else in the mix? And conversely, what is driving the higher margin for this division right now?Sassine GhaziYes. We set out 2 priorities for SIG about 1.5 years, 2 years ago. One is building out our Polaris platform, which is an integrated SaaS, which is the static and dynamic software composition analysis and its cloud-native cloud-ready system. So from a go-to-market point of view, we're still in a transition phase or transitioning our customers to Polaris while we're selling Coverity, Black Duck, et cetera, all the other point products that they can be primarily used on-prem. So that's from a technology platform point of view. From a go-to-market standpoint, actually, we've done a fairly good job in putting the right investments, how much do we do direct, how much do we do through distribution. And we're still on that journey of evolving our go-to-market. Where we're seeing difficulties right now is the negotiation with the customers, given the headwind, they're ending up being a shorter renewals and taking longer to close. So that's really the impact we're seeing, not from a value market share, et cetera, et cetera standpoint. It's just the budget is tighter, in particular, for our enterprise customers.Shelagh GlaserAnd just a comment on operating margin. We're committed to improving operating margin. We had set out to do that this year to improve year-over-year, and we feel well on past that. And obviously, the strong results in Q3 gives us the full year.OperatorWe'll take our final question from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt.Blair Harold AbernethyLet me offer my congratulations on the transition as well, gentleman. Just on the IP business, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of where you're seeing the biggest opportunity over the next, say, 3 to 5 years? Is it 3D multi-die interconnects? Is it AI chip Design IP and just sort of where are you -- how are you thinking about your investments in this segment?Aart J. de GeusOn questionnaires, one would feel I'm all of the above, meaning that the continuation of technology development is still very fast, even for individual chips. And therefore, with those come new speeds, new bandwidth and constant new demand. You're absolutely right to throw in the 3D aspects because one of my perspective on that, it is precisely the fact that 3D has improved dramatically in terms of the connectivity, both in number of pin counts and the speed on the pins and the decrease of energy to switch a pin that actually opens that domain for a decade of success. Now the fact that AI is in the midst of that is -- what's a little bit different about AI processes, it's just the bandwidth and the enormous amount of data that needs to constantly, in many cases, dynamically be treated while the car is driving, so to speak. And so all of these things are wonderful for our field because that says, well, do a lot better. And while the world better, of course, has many variations, we all know that means that there's more design happening, more new chips, more differentiation among the end customers -- among themselves. And so these are positive words in our field for sure. With that, I guess we close the call. Thank you for your attention. For those of you that will connect with us later on today, we're ready to talk to you. And again, have a good rest of the day.Trey CampbellThank you.OperatorAnd that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

This is where folks choose individual stocks based on their singular merits, rather than put additional money into passive, broad-based equity index funds.""We may be exiting the best S&amp;P earnings per share era, but we are likely entering the best stock picker's market in our careers,"" says Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at BofA Securities. ""We recommend being invested in equities but selectively.""That is not to say investors should ditch their index funds; rather, see this as an opportunity to add strong, individual stocks to their portfolio.

It was formed from the 2016 merger of Quintiles, a leading CRO, with IMS Health, a life sciences data and analytics company.Today, IQVIA leverages its extensive patient database to do such things as run virtual clinical trials with up to 90,000 patients globally without them having to leave home. It also uses data to model out what would have happened with placebos in a clinical trial, such that all patients enrolled get active treatment.IQVIA compiles data from more than 150,000 suppliers that include pharmacies, medical claims and electronic health records, and the company has access to more than 1 billion patient records, according to Morningstar analyst Rachel Elfman.""This unmatched database, layered with proprietary methodology, enables clients to set informed strategies to most effectively commercialize their drugs,"" Elfman said.""[W]hile a competitor could theoretically replicate what IQV does with the data by purchasing the patient data, the real value is in IQV's ability to bring it all together and have a global breadth and depth of data,"" Truist Securities analyst Jailendra Singh writes in a recent note.One of the biggest obstacles in clinical trials is recruiting volunteers. IQVIA overcomes this by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to build heat maps to find patients and sites. ""We believe the generative AI can help CROs further significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery and development by identifying potential drug candidates, predicting their efficacy, optimizing their properties, and potentially bringing new treatments to market faster and at a lower cost,"" Singh said.This data also is useful for post-market research and marketing, Singh said. By analyzing large datasets, companies can ""gain a better understanding of the monetary value of their drugs, where they are being adopted and how to make them more valuable.""Singh has a Buy rating on IQV.

In Las Vegas, it owns Caesars Palace, MGM Grand and The Venetian Resort – three of the most recognizable names on the strip.It also owns Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and many others. Overall, the trust's portfolio comprises 50 gaming facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with roughly 60,300 hotel rooms and more than 450 restaurants, bars, nightclubs and sportsbooks.The REIT was formed in 2017 out of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, the largest division of Caesars Entertainment. VICI is a triple-net lease company in which its tenants are responsible for operating costs of the properties. Half of its tenants' leases go up with inflation in 2023, and 96% have this arrangement over the long term. VICI has around $2.9 billion in annualized cash rent.VICI, which came from Julius Caesar's famous 'veni, vidi, vici' quote, was added to the S&amp;P 500 in June 2022. With around $51 billion in enterprise value, it is the largest experiential net lease REIT.In 2017, VICI reported $690 million in adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and it's grown steadily over the years. VICI ending 2022 with $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Moreover, the company has raised its cash divided every year since its inception, and targets a 75% AFFO (adjusted funds from operations, a key REIT earnings metric) payout ratio.In the second quarter of 2023, VICI's AFFO per share rose 11.9% year-over-year to 54 cents, while total revenue was up 35.5% to $898.2 million.As for why VICI is on this list of Strong Buy stocks, the company ""continues to offer greater visibility through its business model coupled with growth through its disciplined investment strategies,"" says Jefferies analyst David Katz. Additionally, the company's focus on acquisitions and partnerships – like its investment in wellness resort Canyon Ranch – ""could add meaningfully to shareholder value over the long term,"" the analyst says.Katz has a Buy rating on VICI Properties and a $43 price target, representing implied upside of 43% to current levels.How to Start Investing In the Stock Market: A Beginner's GuideMarket value: $66.5 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalyst ratings: 10 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong SellAnalysts' consensus recommendation: 1.43 (Strong Buy)As companies move toward adopting advanced technologies such as AI, there will be greater demand for more powerful and complex semiconductors or chips.Enter Synopsys (SNPS, $436.74) – one of Wall Street's top Strong Buy stocks.The company provides software tools and services for semiconductor companies, system-on-a-chip designers and electronics products manufacturers. Its software is used for various stages of the design process, including circuit simulation, logic synthesis and physical design. Synopsys is the largest player in the electronic design automation (EDA) market.The company recently announced an expanded intellectual property (IP) and EDA partnership with Intel (INTC). Needham analyst Charles Shi believes this deal could have a ""significant"" impact to Synopsys' ""revenue and backlog due to the likely breadth and duration of the contract.""Without a readily available foundational and interface IP, many fabless customers would find it difficult to adopt Intel and Samsung's foundry processes, Shi says. ""Given Intel's ambition to grow its foundry business under the IDM 2.0 model, we think this agreement may be worth billions of dollars and add handsomely to SNPS' backlog.Shi has a Buy rating and a $500 price target on Synopsys, reflecting implied upside of 14.5% over the next 12 months or so.Best Long-Term Investment Stocks to BuyMarket value: $27.7 billionDividend yield: 0.9%Analyst ratings: 14 Strong Buy, 5 Buy, 0 Hold, 1 Sell, 0 Strong SellAnalysts' consensus recommendation: 1.40 (Strong Buy)Among major airline carriers, Delta Air Lines (DAL, $43.02) is uniquely positioned.According to Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, Delta is the ""best around"" when it comes to airline stocks amid steady demand for travel and the company's efforts to deleverage and restore its balance sheet.""We continue to believe Delta's balanced capital deployment strategy, structural advantages and opportunity to grow higher-margin businesses should enable it to retain its relative operational and financial leadership vs legacy peers,"" Syth writes in a note to clients. The analyst has a Strong Buy rating on DAL with a $58 price target, representing implied upside of nearly 35%.Meanwhile, Morningstar analyst Nicolas Owens expects ""continued growth"" in the near term thanks to ""strong domestic leisure travel, a strengthening business travel recovery, and increasing international travel due to fewer travel restrictions compared with 2022."" And over the longer term, Owens believes Delta ""can return to 2019 levels of capacity in 2024, and we expect revenue passenger miles will be approximately 19% higher in 2027, our midcycle year, than in 2019.""But even Strong Buy stocks carry risk, with Delta in particular susceptible to geopolitical uncertainty, volatility in the oil markets and stiff competition, Owens says.Best Stocks for Rising Interest RatesMarket value: $1.41 trillionDividend yield: N/AAnalyst ratings: 37 Strong Buy, 13 Buy, 4 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong SellAnalysts' consensus recommendation: 1.39 (Strong Buy)Like many companies, Amazon.com (AMZN, $137.67) tightened its belt as the economy decelerated. And while revenue grew at a slower pace in 2022 than previous years, the tide appears to be turning for Amazon.In the second quarter of 2023, for instance, revenue jumped 11% year-over-year, while earnings arrived at 65 cents per share vs a loss of 20 cents per share in the year-ago period. What's more, the company saw record sales for its July Amazon Prime Day shopping event, with another one scheduled for October.""Management has replaced caution on sales growth and margins with a more positive outlook for both retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS),"" says Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher. ""Other non-retail businesses such as subscriptions and advertising saw resurgent growth [in Q2] after slowing in the prior two quarters.""Those making the bull case for Amazon say it remains the leader in e-commerce with around a 40% market share as its Amazon Prime membership helps attract and retain customers. Plus, its Amazon Web Services division is number one in the cloud computing market, which it invented, with around a 32% share, according to Synergy Research Group.Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company will continue to manage expenses to be in line with revenues. It already shut some of its physical stores such as Bookstores and 4 Star and cut development of devices ""where we didn't see a path to meaningful returns,"" Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. Amazon has reorganized its fulfillment centers geographically as well and made internal operational changes in such areas as processes and physical operations, to lower costs and increase speed of delivery.AMZN is the highest rated of the Strong Buy stocks featured here. Plus, the mean target price of $167.92 indicates implied upside of nearly 22% over the next 12 months or so.

The conservative ADF has represented clients opposing abortion, same-sex marriages and transgender rights.Roth said ethics training would have been fine, but the judge should not have ordered training run by any organization tied to a particular faith.“Starr’s order sets a dangerous precedent, and he deserves sanctions himself for this awful judgment call,” he said.The judge ordered the training after Southwest changed the language of a notice that he ordered sent to employees to explain the legal prohibition against religious discrimination.Southwest, based in Dallas, has appealed the sanctions order and the trial victory of the fired flight attendant.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) share price is up 20% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Disappointingly, the share price is down 7.0% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, Philip Morris International achieved compound earnings per share growth of 3.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Philip Morris International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Philip Morris International's TSR for the last 3 years was 40%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Philip Morris International had a tough year, with a total loss of 1.9% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.8%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PPG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.50, while NVZMY has a forward P/E of 26.21. We also note that PPG has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NVZMY currently has a PEG ratio of 14.89.Another notable valuation metric for PPG is its P/B ratio of 4.20. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NVZMY has a P/B of 5.46.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PPG's Value grade of B and NVZMY's Value grade of D.PPG sticks out from NVZMY in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PPG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Increased customer demand, capacity expansion and improvements in plant productivity are contributing to higher volumes.Albemarle saw higher volumes in the Energy Storage unit in the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the expansion of La Negra III/IV in Chile and a surge in tolling volumes to meet the growing demand from customers. Production from the processing plant in Qinzhou, China also contributed to the volume growth.Albemarle is also benefiting from cost-saving and productivity initiatives. It sees $250 million in productivity benefits over 2023 and 2024 through operational discipline. The company’s cost actions are expected to support its margins in 2023.The company is also strategically executing its projects aimed at boosting its global lithium conversion capacity. It remains focused on investing in high-return projects to drive productivity. The company is well placed to gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market.Albemarle's Kemerton I lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Western Australia achieved first product in July 2022. Kemerton II is also progressing through the commissioning phase. Kemerton III and IV projects have also been moved into execution. Moreover, the Qinzhou plant in China will also boost the growth of conversion capacity and drive lithium volumes. Mechanical completion of the Meishan facility is also expected in early 2024. The Salar yield improvement project has also moved into the commissioning phase.Story continuesSoftness in Specialties AilsThe company’s Specialties unit is exposed to headwinds from demand weakness.  Sales from the segment tumbled around 20% year over year in the second quarter, hurt by lower volumes and pricing related to weakness in certain end markets.The segment faces demand headwinds in consumer and industrial electronics and elastomers markets. The demand weakness is expected to continue in the third quarter of 2023. Albemarle has reduced its adjusted EBITDA outlook for the segment for 2023 factoring in the demand softness. Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus Albemarle Corporation Price and ConsensusAlbemarle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Albemarle Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderAlbemarle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, PPG Industries, Inc.

But the transaction was carried out without triggering disclosures normally required under Dutch financial market rules if a company accumulates a stake of more than 3%, 5%, 10%, or 15% in a Dutch company.When asked about this by reporters, Philips CEO Roy Jakobs said Exor had used a ""construct with a financial institution"" but gave no further details.A US Securities and Exchange Commission filing published earlier this week showed that Exor had first purchased a stake of 2.99% in Philips by June 30 -- just under the reporting threshold.Filings by the Dutch Financial Market Authority AFM dated Aug. 14 but published late on Wednesday showed Goldman Sachs had taken an 12.11% stake in Philips using a derivatives structure that included 95 million call options.Sources confirmed to Reuters earlier this week that Goldman Sachs acted on behalf of Exor but could not give more details.Exor and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Law firm Allen &amp; Overy acted as Exor's legal adviser on the deal, the sources said. Law firm De Brauw confirmed it advised Philips. An Allen &amp; Overy spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.An AFM spokesperson confirmed, without reference to the Exor deal, that there is no legal obstacle to an investor jumping various thresholds in terms of accumulating a shareholding in a single day.Philips welcomed Exor's investment and the companies signed an agreement over the weekend that Exor would commit to not raising its stake further than 20%, eliminating the possibility of a full takeover attempt.(Reporting by Toby Sterling, Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro, Andres Gonzalez, Valentina Za and Emma-Victoria Farr.

In a new report, Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts break down some of the key themes they have seen this quarter: AI, talk of recession, and volume versus pricing. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the report.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, Goldman Sachs is out with its quarterly S&amp;P 500 Beige Book. The firm highlighting key issues facing company managements. And here to break down the dominating themes this earnings season, we've got Josh Schafer following this for us. Josh, walk us through some of those themes.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Akiko. It's been interesting to take a look at what we've learned from earnings overall, right? When you look at this report from Goldman Sachs, a couple interesting things that they highlighted, three main themes here. Of course, we have to talk about artificial intelligence, right? And companies have been talking a lot about artificial intelligence.So you've actually seen artificial intelligence mentions rise about 32% this quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. And you can see that graph really still going up and to the right. I found that pretty interesting, because I didn't think my biggest takeaway from this earnings season was AI as it was last earnings season.But then when you take a look at it by sector, also interesting to see who's mentioning AI. So 80% of tech companies mentioning artificial intelligence, sort of telling you that tech companies still feel like it's a part of-- it needs to be a part of their strategy. It needs to be something they're mentioning. And then you also see there, real estate and communication services, some of the other top sectors that are calling out artificial intelligence.Now, another thing they also highlighted was companies talking about recessions. And we know that a lot of companies have been talking about a recession, a looming recession coming toward the end of last year, maybe first quarter of this year or during those fourth quarter earnings calls earlier this year. But you can see that number is down significantly as well. And you would think back to the early part of earnings season, Akiko, when we heard from those financials, when we heard from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, those banks really had a positive, upbeat look on the consumer.Story continuesAnd the consumer at least remaining resilient and not seeing a downturn. So not shocking to see that number for the recession calls there, because you think about what we're hearing this week, you're hearing Target maybe warn about that consumer a little bit, still not necessarily talking about a recession. And again, Goldman Sachs did this research before target reported earnings this morning.And then a final thing that was interesting to point out that they highlighted in this was volumes versus pricing, what's driving sales. That's something we've been watching a lot when we think about the story of inflation and how inflation is impacting these companies. Now, Goldman Sachs found that some companies are saying that volumes is still what's driving sales. And they're seeing less volumes, but prices are still high. So that's keeping their sales up. While other companies, like Target, are saying volumes are down. Prices might actually be coming down. And that's what's driving sales down.So we haven't gotten a clear picture yet on where that story is going to play out. It seems a little bit mixed right now. But that price versus volume will be something to watch, especially when it does come to retail over the next couple quarters.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. It feels like not all retailers, you know, sort of on the same page when it comes to the timeline for bringing down some of those prices that were inflated several quarters ago. I want to see if we can pull up that chart on AI again, because, Josh, in many ways, we keep talking about this hype cycle. But it really was the last quarter where every company felt the need to just mention AI.This quarter is kind of the show me cycle, right? It is about, how do you monetize this technology? And as a result of that, we have seen just sort of outsized mentions here from tech companies, because they are in fact, the ones that are driving some of these investments. Have we seen other sectors really talk about the monetization? I mean, what more color have we gotten about how that technology is likely to be integrated?JOSH SCHAFER: There's been less commentary on actual monetization, right? And I think that's why you've seen less mentions across other sectors. You mentioned, Akiko, a lot of tech companies have been talking about it. And when we think back to last quarter, it sort of became a little bit of a running gag that everyone had an AI strategy, right? Coke was telling you how AI was going to change their business. And you could argue AI might change how factory workers work or something like that within Coca-Cola's business. But it's not exactly Nvidia either, right?And I think we've seen less companies that don't have a direct strategy for how AI is going to improve revenue or boost revenue in the next couple of quarters, mentioning it, because they realize that right now, that's not really being rewarded by investors. That was being rewarded by investors when you go back three or four months ago. But you take a look at this quarter, and people have been more interested in how AI is directly impacting revenues. Meta said that AI would directly-- has directly been impacting their revenues, keeping people on the app longer. Stock popped almost 10%.Other companies have said that AI is going to be a little bit longer, a little bit slower of a play. Even AMD, which is considered an AI play said, you know, AI is going to be a little bit further down the line. And so that was something that was interesting to see, because that stock didn't react as well. So AI, yes, companies still feel like they need to mention it but maybe not as much as they felt like they needed to mention it when we were really in the heart of that hype cycle.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. It feels like it is about setting expectations, right? A bit of reality check kicking in now. Josh Schafer, thanks so much for that.]"

The 'Barbie' movie has grossed $1.19 billion worldwide thus far. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down how much Robbie is making and how it stacks up compared to her male counterparts.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]ALEXANDRA CANAL: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" I'm Alexandra Canal. Alexandra Canal. Can I speak? Here with Josh Schafer and Brooke DiPalma. And guys, we're talking ""Barbie,"" which we normally do on the roundtable. But this is interesting, because Margot Robbie, the star of the film, she's expected to make a heck of a lot of money from this, $50 million in salary and box-office bonuses.And this immediately brought me back to way back in the day, not that long ago, if you can believe it, but during COVID, remember, when Scarlett Johansson she had that massive lawsuit against Disney, because they decided to put Black Widow on Disney Plus and skipping the theatrical experience entirely. At that time, Scarlett Johansson said she lost out on a lot of money due to those box-office bonuses, which as we're seeing is a really significant part. So as the actors strike is ongoing, that's something that I've been thinking about that actors are fighting for when it comes to this new streaming age revolution. But then, of course, for Margot Robbie, a pretty good payday right now.BROOKE DIPALMA: Very good payday. And I often wonder how much exactly these stars, these celebrities make from each movie that they're in. I mean, they're turning out one per year. We were just chatting about some of Margot Robbie's other films. She was in ""Babylon."" She was in ""Wolf of Wall Street."" And to see this significant of a payout, $50 million. But when you think about the billion-dollar franchise that it is, is that a lot, would you say?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I would say it's pretty significant. To your point, right, these stars only-- some of the big ones-- they only do a movie a year. If that, I mean, Leonardo DiCaprio, he's pretty picky with the movies he does, because he has the ability to make a lot of money. It just goes to show even though there's a lot of turmoil in this industry right now, there is still a lot of lucrative opportunities at the box office.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: All right. So I've been trying to get a little bit of perspective on the numbers, right?ALEXANDRA CANAL: OK.JOSH SCHAFER: So Barbie just passed ""Batman-- The Dark Knight,"" one of my favorite movies of all time, for total domestic box office. And so I looked up how much Christian Bale made off ""Batman."" Quick answer off Google tells me he made $9 million off ""Batman Begins,"" $10 million off ""The Dark Knight,"" 15 million off ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Then when you add in some of the bonuses off the trilogy, so all three ""Batmans,"" which I would consider very popular movies--BROOKE DIPALMA: Very popular.JOSH SCHAFER: --Christian Bale made about $50 million. And we're talking about Margot--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: And we're talking about Margot Robbie making $50 million off one movie. Now, again, remember, ""The Dark Knight"" came out in 2008, so a little bit of a different-- there was a long time ago at this point for how much people made.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But that was also peak box office, peak theatrical.BROOKE DIPALMA: You also have to remember the theaters being absolutely packed for that. So you have to imagine that the people attending, you know, the tickets that were sold for that compared to what we're seeing now, perhaps a similar, but you weigh in inflation, you weigh in all that fun stuff, you know, how much more ticket prices today than they were back in 2008 and maybe perhaps the cut that she's getting, how does that compare.BROOKE DIPALMA: To me--ALEXANDRA CANAL: She's a producer on this movie, too--BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. Correct.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --which we should point out.JOSH SCHAFER: And I think the thing for ""Barbie"" with me when comparing it to ""The Dark Knight 2"" that you just think about is like in 2008, we were going to the movies regularly still, right? ""Barbie"" to me has been one of the big-- I think it has been the biggest talking to friends. People are going to see ""Barbie"" moment since we've got out of the pandemic as far as just, I'm actually going to the movies. You don't talk to people often anymore--ALEXANDRA CANAL: You want to be a part of the culture.JOSH SCHAFER: --adn ask what they're doing over the weekend. And they say they're going to the movies. The past three weeks people have said. Yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I do, too. You're not the only one that has, Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: I've seen ""Oppenheimer."" I haven't seen ""Barbie.""ALEXANDRA CANAL: OK. That's good. You see, he's on one of the two.BROOKE DIPALMA: Exactly.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But, yeah, I do think it's just a cultural moment, and people want to be involved in the conversation at all.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And, you know, really quickly on that cultural moment, I did read that 75% are under the age of 29 who are going to see this movie. And I can't help but think, what does this mean for Halloween sales?

88,3c303d7f-6667-39ae-9e01-21a179568c3d,NTRS,2023-08-17,Is FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexshares-international-quality-dividend-etf-102007650.html,1692267607,STORY,['NTRS'],"[The FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) was launched on 04/12/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Flexshares. IQDF has been able to amass assets over $542.91 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the World ETFs. IQDF, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.47%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.73%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Bhp Group Ltd Common Stock Aud 0 (BHP) accounts for about 3.12% of the fund's total assets, followed by Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) and Novo Nordisk A/s Common Stock Dkk 0.2 (NOVOb.CO).Performance and RiskThe ETF has gained about 7.19% so far this year and is up about 6.80% in the last one year (as of 08/17/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $17.72 and $23.06.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 15.80% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 278 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $27.68 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $69.55 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NFLX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $20 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Netflix shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Broadcast Radio and Television industry that ranks in the Top 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, nine analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.14 per share to $3.48 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Netflix right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

In addition to an unclear number of employees at its locations in Houston, Texas, Singapore, London and Humber, and the United Kingdom, Phillips 66 will lay off 100 full-time employees at its Bartlesville, OK, office.As part of its broader strategy to reduce yearly expenditures by $1 billion by the end of 2023, PSX executed staff cuts in 2022 as well that saved the company about $250 million. Although the targeted workforce reduction of 1,100 employees was accomplished in 2022, the company noted that resignations accounted for a sizable amount of the total staff cut.Phillips 66 previously stated that one way to reduce costs would be to centralize support functions for individual refineries, including finance, procurement and IT.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Phillips 66 carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the energy space are CVR Energy Inc.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:There continues to be modest pressure on estimates for Q3 and beyond, but a big part of that is coming from the Energy sector. Outside of the Energy sector, estimates are very stable and are actually increasing for some key sectors.For the 463 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -9.2% from the same period last year on +0.6% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.We see the above-average Q2 EPS beats percentage as reflective of a favorable turn in underlying earnings trends, particularly since Q2 estimates hadn’t fallen as much as we have seen in other recent quarters.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.3% on +0.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.2% on +3.1% higher revenues.The weak sales numbers from Target TGT – the retailer missed consensus estimates for the top-line and same-store sales – are most likely a function of company-specific execution and merchandising issues, not reflective of moderation in consumer spending.Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesTarget’s Q2 margins were better, and management indicated satisfaction with inventory levels. But investors can’t be faulted for being skeptical of such views, as continuation of Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends in the current and coming quarters will mean the inventory overhang coming back all over again.Unlike Walmart WMT, which hasn’t reported results yet but has a much bigger groceries business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise. At the same time, consumer spending on discretionary items of the type that Target specializes in has undoubtedly moderated as demand shifted towards leisure, travel, and related activities. But Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.Consumer spending will eventually slow down in response to Fed tightening. However, we didn’t see much evidence of that in the Q1 earnings reports, neither from Walmart and Target nor from other consumer-centric companies.These big-box retail leaders missed due to weak execution and failure to have the right merchandise in stores. Consumers didn’t buy the patio furniture at Walmart or appliances at Target, but they did plenty of shopping at Home Depot HD.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from almost 93% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.The blended growth for the quarter is on track for an earnings decline of -8.0% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -3.4% decline in index earnings in the preceding period (2023 Q1) and the -5.4% decline in the last quarter of 2022.In other words, 2023 Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.3%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Gap, Inc. GPS, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. OLLI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy on Robust July SalesRetail sales grew in July driven by robust consumer spending, the Commerce Department said on Aug 15. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike campaign is finally bearing fruit as inflation has sharply declined over the past year. The impact is showing in the steady growth in retail sales over the past few months.Given this situation, investing in stocks like The Gap, Inc., The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc. and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. will be a wise option.Retail Sales JumpRetail sales jumped a solid 0.7% to $696.4 billion in July, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4%, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding autos, retail sales rose a solid 1% in July, surpassing expectations of a 0.4% rise. This follows a 0.2% rise in June.This has so far been the best reading since January 2023. Also, e-commerce sales increased a robust 1.9%, while sales at restaurants and bars rose 1.4%. Sales at sporting goods stores climbed 1.5%.The report indicates that the U.S. economy is still going strong and might avoid slipping into a recession. The jump in retail sales comes as inflation continues to steadily decline from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July for the first time in more than 12 months. The modest rise in July indicates that there is still solid demand for goods, which is driving sales.Story continuesOn a year-over-year basis, retail sales rose 3.2% in July, in line with the annual CPI increase.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with June being the only exception. This has taken the benchmark borrowing rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, a steady decline in inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its current interest rate hike campaign. This bodes well for the retail sector as lower interest rates will give more purchasing power to consumers.Our ChoicesThe Gap, Inc. is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories and personal care products.

I want to highlight that customer traffic drove our 6% overall comp sales increase, and it increased at all of our divisions. As a reminder, for us, customer traffic represents the number of customer transactions.I am particularly pleased with the performance of our largest division, Marmaxx, which delivered high single-digit increases in both comp sales and customer traffic. Our overall apparel and accessories sales were very strong. and our overall home sales significantly improved and returned to positive comp sales growth. Clearly, our terrific mix of branded, fashionable merchandise and great values resonated with shoppers when they visited our stores.In terms of profitability, both pretax profit margin and earnings per share increased significantly versus last year. Importantly, merchandise margin continues to be very healthy with our above-plan sales and profitability performance in the second quarter, we are raising our full year outlook for comp sales, pretax profit margin and earnings per share. John will talk to this in a moment.We are very pleased with the continued momentum of our business and the excellent execution of our teams across the company. They have been laser-focused on driving sales and traffic and improving profitability. The third quarter is off to a very strong start, and we feel great about our plans for the remainder of the year.The marketplace is loaded with outstanding buying opportunities and we are confident that we will continue to offer a terrific mix of brands and an outstanding assortment of gifts to our shoppers during the fall and holiday selling seasons. We are convinced that our differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values will continue to serve us well and allow us to capture additional market share across our geographies for many years to come.Before I continue, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our second quarter financial results in more detail.John KlingerThanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work. I'll start with some additional details on the second quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our overall comp store sales well above the high end of our plan and were entirely driven by an increase in customer traffic. We were very pleased to see that both comp store sales growth and customer traffic improved sequentially each month of the quarter.As we expected, average ticket was down due to merchandise mix, the impact of the lower ticket on sales was largely offset by an increase in units with shoppers putting more items into their cart. This is in line with what we have seen in our business historically. Our overall apparel business, including accessories, continued its momentum with high single-digit comp increase. Overall, home comp sales were up mid-single digits.TJX net sales grew to $12.8 billion, an 8% increase versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Second quarter consolidated pretax margin of 10.4% was up 120 basis points versus last year. This was well above our plan due to a bigger benefit than we expected from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on our above-plan sales. Gross margin was up 260 basis points. This increase was driven by a higher merchandise margin due to the significant benefit from lower freight costs. This year-over-year freight benefit was primarily driven by lower rates as well as a benefit from our freight initiatives and the remainder of our year -- in the remainder of our year-end accrual adjustment. Gross margin also benefited from our inventory and fuel hedges in expense leverage on a 6% comp increase. Our year-over-year shrink accrual and supply chain investments were headwinds to gross margin in the second quarter.Second quarter SG&amp;A increased 170 basis points due to a combination of factors. These include higher incentive accruals and due to above planned results, a reserve related to a German government COVID program receivable, incremental store wage and payroll costs and a contribution to the TJX Foundation. Net interest income benefited pretax profit margin by 40 basis points versus last year. Lastly, we were very pleased that earnings per share of $0.85 were up 23% versus last year and also well above our expectations.Now moving to our second quarter divisional performance. At Marmaxx, second quarter comp store sales increased an outstanding 8%, entirely driven by customer traffic. Marmaxx's apparel and home categories both saw high single-digit comp increases. Further, it was great to see comp sales and traffic increases accelerate every month throughout the quarter. Comp sales were very strong across each of Marmaxx's region. We also saw consistent performance across low, mid- and high-income store demographics.Marmaxx's second quarter segment profit margin was 13.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by a benefit from lower freight costs as well as expense leverage on the strong sales and strong mark on. We continue to be pleased with the momentum at Marmaxx and are excited about the initiatives we have planned to help us drive sales and traffic for the remainder of the year and beyond.At HomeGoods, we were very pleased to see second quarter comp store sales increased 4% and a significant increase in our end customer traffic. HomeGoods comp sales and traffic increases also accelerated every month throughout the quarter. I also want to note that our full year plans assume that HomeGoods will continue to comp positively for the second half of the year. HomeGoods second quarter segment profit margin was 8.7%, up 600 basis points and entirely due to benefit -- a benefit from lower freight costs. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities we see to grow both our HomeGoods and HomeSense banners and capture additional share of the U.S. home market.At Canada, Comp store sales were up 1% and customer traffic increased. Segment profit margin was 15%. As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer in Canada, we have a very loyal shopper base in many value-conscious shop customers. We are confident that we are set up well to continue growing our footprint across Canada and attract more customers to our banners.At TJX International, comp store sales increased 3% and customer traffic was also up. It was great to see comp sales and traffic increases at both our European and Australian businesses. During the quarter, we also launched online shopping in Germany and Austria. Segment profit margin for TJX International on a constant currency basis was 2.1%, which was negatively impacted by over 300 basis points due to the reserve related to the German receivable I spoke to earlier. We are very happy with our overall performance in this division and are confident we can continue to grow our banners in our existing countries and improve profitability.As to e-commerce, overall, it remains a very small percentage of our business. We continue to add new merchandise to our sites so that shoppers can see something new every time they visit.Moving to inventory. Balance sheet inventory was down 7% versus the second quarter of fiscal '23. Similar to the first quarter, the year-over-year decline was primarily due to the elevated levels we saw last year from the early arrival of merchandise and a larger in-transit balance as a result of supply chain delays at that time. We feel great about inventory levels in the outstanding buying environment. As Ernie said, the marketplace is loaded with merchandise, and we are well positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season.I'll finish with our liquidity and shareholder distributions. For the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash. In the second quarter, we paid down $500 million of maturing debt and returned $932 million to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.Now I'll turn it back to Ernie.Ernie L. HerrmanI'll start by highlighting the key strengths that have allowed TJX to grow successfully through many kinds of retail and economic cycles for nearly 5 decades. I'm convinced that these core strengths set us apart from many other retailers and will continue to be a tremendous advantage going forward. First is our value leadership. Our goal has always been to offer great value on every item, every day to every customer. At TJX, value is more than just offering consumers a great price. For us, value also means delivering desirable brands, fashionable merchandise and great quality to our shoppers. We believe our value proposition is 1 of the best in all of retail, and we'll continue to attract consumers to our retail banners all around the world.Second, we have developed 1 of the most flexible brick-and-mortar retail models in the world. The flexibility of our close to need opportunistic buying allows our merchants to quickly react to the hottest trends in the marketplace and adapt to changing consumer preferences. The flexibility of our supply chain and store formats allows us to ship to our stores multiple times a week, merchandise stores individually and flex our floor space to support our ever-changing assortment.Third, we successfully operate stores across a wide customer demographic. We want to sell to everyone, and we aim to appeal to all value-conscious shoppers and inspire and excite them every time they visit us. The flexibility of our business allows us to curate an assortment of good, better and best merchandise across our stores, and to appeal to shoppers across all income demographic areas. Next, we have built an expansive vendor universe over many decades and believe we have some of the best relationships in all of retail. This vast network of changing vendors, which numbered approximately 21,000 over the last year is the reason why we are so confident that there will always be more than enough inventory in the marketplace for us to buy. Our best-in-class buying organization of 1,200-plus merchants does a terrific job selecting the right mix of categories and brands for the right stores to create our fun treasure hunt shopping experience.We also see the globalness of our business as a tremendous strength. We have built a highly integrated global infrastructure, supply chain and buying organization that we believe would be difficult to replicate. This allows us to leverage our global presence to create a differentiated treasure hunt shopping experience in each country we operate in.Last, but certainly not least, is our talent. Teaching and talent development have always been priorities at TJX. Through our organization and management teams, we have deep decades-long off-price experience in the U.S. and internationally. I believe that our global talent base will continue to be a tremendous advantage as we continue our growth around the world. I truly believe that the combination of these key strengths and the execution of them, is why we are 1 of the strongest companies in all of retail and have a very long history of successful performance.Now I'll briefly highlight the opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, as I said earlier, we are seeing phenomenal product availability across all categories and a wide range of brands. This gives us great confidence that we can bring consumers the right assortment at the right values throughout the fall and holiday season. Second, we feel great about our store merchandising initiatives that we have planned. We are particularly excited about our gifting initiatives as we continue to focus on being a destination for gifts throughout the year. With our rapidly changing assortment, we believe shoppers will be inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new. And third, we have very strong marketing campaigns planned. Each of our brands will continue to reinforce our value leadership position through a combination of channels, including digital, television and social media. We believe our compelling campaigns will capture the attention of new consumers while keeping us top of mind with our existing customers.Moving to profitability. We are extremely pleased that the high end of our adjusted pretax profit margin plan for fiscal 2024 now exceeds our previously announced target of 10.6% for fiscal 2025. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the entire organization. I want to assure you that we did not be that we will not be complacent and we'll strive to continue improving our profitability over the long term.Before I close, I'd also like to reinforce our deep commitment to acting as a responsible corporate citizen, and I am proud of the work our teams across the globe continue to do. We expect to publish our annual global corporate responsibility report this fall. And I hope you'll take some time to look at our website to learn more about what we are doing.Summing up, we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing across the business and the very strong start to the third quarter. We've had excellent performance in the first half of the year, and our teams have put us in a great position for continued success for the remainder of the year. I'm convinced that the characteristics of our flexible off-price business model and the operating expertise within our organization are unmatched.I am so proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and a key component of our success. I am extremely confident about the future of TJX and I'm excited about the opportunities we see to capture additional market share and improve profitability in the long term.Now I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full year and third quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.John KlingerThanks, again, Ernie. Before I start, I want to remind you that fiscal '24 calendar includes a 53rd week. Also, as we stated in our press release this morning, we have offered eligible former TJX associates who have not yet commenced their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. We anticipate that the impact of this pension payout offer, primarily a noncash settlement charge, could negatively impact fiscal '24 EPS by approximately $0.01 to $0.02, but could be higher or lower depending on participation rates and other factors.To be clear, any of the guidance we are providing today does not include the potential impact of this pension payout offer. We expect to exclude the impact of this potential settlement charge from our adjusted pretax profit margin and EPS results in the third quarter.Now to our full year guidance. We are now planning an overall comp store sales increase of 3% to 4%. As a reminder, our comp guidance excludes our expected sales from the 53rd week. For the full year, we now expect consolidated sales to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $800 million of additional revenue expected from the 53rd week.As Ernie said, we're increasing our full year profitability guidance. We're now planning full year pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.8%, excluding an expected benefit of approximately 10 basis points from the 53rd week, we now expect adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.7%. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 90 to 100 basis points versus fiscal '23's adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.7%.Regarding shrink, we continue to be laser-focused on our in-store initiatives while making sure we maintain an enjoyable shopping experience for our customers. At this time, our shrink indicators are leading us to believe that we can continue to plan shrink flat in fiscal '24. As a reminder, we will not know the full effect of our shrink initiatives or the accuracy of our indicators until we do a full annual inventory count at the end of the year.Moving on, we're planning full year adjusted gross margin on a 52-week basis in the range of 29.4% to 29.5%, a 180 to 190 basis point increase versus last year. we expect virtually all of this increase to be driven by a benefit from lower freight costs. We are also planning a benefit from merchandise margin. This guidance also assumes a continuation of headwinds from our supply chain investments and incremental distribution center wages.We are very pleased with the level of freight recapture we are seeing given the significant pressure we saw over the prior 3 years. Our expected freight benefit this year includes a pull forward of most of the benefit we were expecting in fiscal '25. We remain laser-focused and looking at ways to reduce our freight costs. Moving on, we're expecting full year SG&amp;A on a 52-week basis to be approximately 19.1%, a 120 basis point increase versus last year. This expected increase is primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals.For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a full year tax rate of 26% and Net interest income on a 52-week basis of about $157 million, and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.16 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.66 to $3.72. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $0.10 from the 53rd week, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. On a 52-week basis, this would represent an increase of 10 -- excuse me, 14% to 16% versus fiscal '23's adjusted earnings per share of $3.11. Lastly, we now expect to open about 125 net new stores in fiscal 2024, an increase of approximately 3%. This reflects a shift of some of our planned fall openings into next year.Moving to the third quarter. We're planning overall comp store sales growth to be up 3% to 4%. Similar to the second quarter, we expect the comp increase to be driven by customer traffic. We're planning for average ticket to be down less than it was in the second quarter, again, due to merchandise mix. We're also expecting an increase in units sold. We expect third quarter consolidated sales to be in the range of $12.9 billion to $13.1 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over the prior year.We're planning third quarter pretax profit margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%. We're expecting third quarter gross margin in the range of 30.3% to 30.5%, up 120 to 140 basis points versus last year. We're planning a significant benefit from lower freight costs partially offset by headwinds from supply chain investments, inventory cap and our year-over-year shrink accrual.We're planning third quarter SG&amp;A of approximately 19.3%, up 130 basis points versus last year. This expected increase is driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive accruals. For modeling purposes, we're currently assuming a third quarter tax rate of 25.3% and net interest income of about $40 million and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.15 billion shares. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.98, up 10% to 14% versus last year's adjusted $0.86. For the fourth quarter, on a 13-week basis, we're planning comp store sales to be up 3% to 4%, adjusted pretax margin in the range of 10.3% to 10.5% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.03. We will provide more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter on our third quarter earnings call.Before I close, I want to echo Ernie's comments that we continue to see opportunities to further improve profitability over the long term. As always, the best way for us to drive profitability is with outsized sales. We continue to see opportunities to grow sales and traffic and capture additional market share. Further, we remain laser-focused on being even better on buying and retail and driving merchandise margin.At the same time, we're expecting continue to face headwinds from incremental wage costs and supply chain investments. As usual, we'll give you a detailed annual guidance beyond this year on our February -- on our call in February.In closing, I want to reiterate that we are very pleased with our -- with the execution of our teams across the company and are confident in our sales and profitability plans. Further, we have a strong balance sheet and are in an excellent financial position to simultaneously invest in the growth of our business and return significant cash to our shareholders. Now we are happy to take your questions as we do every quarter. (Operator Instructions)Thanks, and now we'll open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Matthew Boss.Matthew Robert BossCongrats on a really nice quarter. So Ernie, you cited the third quarter off to a very strong start and tremendous off-price buying opportunities. Could you just elaborate on how traffic and demand progressed over the course of the second quarter, maybe what you've seen in August, across both apparel and home. And then, John, could you just elaborate on the improved bottom line full year outlook as we think about AUR and freight relative to shrink and wages?Ernie L. HerrmanSure. Matt, good question. Obviously, looking at as the indicator I gave when I said very strong for the Q3 start, which is coming out of Q2 where each month got a little stronger. So we were sequentially stronger throughout Q2 as the quarter went on. and that momentum has now continued into Q3. And I think you were asking about any differentiator between apparel or home, I would tell you when it well. When you have comps like this and you have Marmaxx running such a high comp as they did, as you can imagine, we are we are experiencing health across just about every category in the store.And in fact, the parallel across the board has been very healthy as has the home area. And I'm talking within Marmaxx because you've seen that home goods from -- remember, Q1 in Home goods, we were down 7%, and now we were up for in home goods for Q2, which is really a terrific. We had signaled to all of you that we thought there'd be incremental improvement. Clearly, it was even exceeded our expectations. And we are feeling very good about that business also as we go into Q3. So I hope that answered your question.John KlingerAnd Matt, just to answer the question you had for me. I mean, as far as the back half and full year guidance. We continue to see freight opportunity in our initiatives, obviously, increasing our the confidence we have to increase our top line sales gives us the confidence to increase our back half guidance. As far as AUR look, as far as pricing and merchandise margin, they were in line with our expectations. In the buying environment, it's fantastic. As Ernie said, we continue to see opportunities to take price in certain areas and merchandise margin improvement. We're really pleased at how our strategies this quarter drove our top line and again, gave us the confidence to increase our full year comp.Ernie L. HerrmanJohn, as I was touching on it in your question, as we talked -- remember, there was a little bit confusion on the last call, and we talked about how our ticket might be down slightly and pretty much it was on our expectations. right in line. And as a result, we drove our top line as we had explained to you in some of our meetings about you can't judge the average ticket and its sales relationship because some of the categories that we were growing in the mix of departments create multiple purchases. And so we're pleased to see it all really went along the lines of what we had discussed back at the end of Q1.OperatorOur next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI just wanted to confirm what I think you just said, which was the like-for-like price increases are working and the ticket decline was just mix. And then my question is if you think you're seeing any signs of a trade-down customer coming into any of your banners?Ernie L. HerrmanLorraine, so we got it. So yes, the like-for-like pricing continues to work. We continue to see opportunity there as we move forward. And again, we do that, as we said from the very beginning, we do that very selectively in certain areas and certain categories and certain items as witnessed by our performance as well as we have another data point, which we measure qualitatively where we measure customer perception of our values.First of all, we can talk from our turns as well as our sales. But we have another perception point where consumers right now are actually seeing our value perception versus a year ago has actually ticked up a couple of notches. So we're viewed against ourselves as value perception has improved, which tells you it's working. And then a second thing ironically is against the category average, we have improved.So those are good barometers. We can see it in the metrics though, Lorraine, when you look at our turns and our sales. And where, again, as we've also said, is where we have ever founded an item where it didn't work, we adjust and then we bring that item back to where we think if it needs to work. But our hit rate has been 90-plus percent. So the second part of your question, again, grain was on the...Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAny signs of a trade down concerning...Ernie L. HerrmanTrade down, which hard for us to measure trade down. What I think we would say is store closures as well as, I would say, because in some cases, it's not a trade down or it's a trade over based on the category. So hard for us to measure trade down. What we can feel is capturing market share from other retailers that have closed or downsized in some of their store counts. And I am sure we are getting increased market share because we can see it in some of the categories that we carry.John KlingerYes. I mean there's been a lot of volatility in the retail environment for a while. And we think we've got strong execution. We feel that we continue to gain that market share.OperatorNext, you will hear from Brooke Roach.Brooke Siler RoachWith greater visibility to your previous long-term 10.6% FY '25 margin target, can you help contextualize the key drivers of future profit improvement? How are you thinking about the rate and pace of that potential improvement beyond some of these freight recapture opportunities that you've seen this year?John KlingerYes. Brooke, we're not giving guidance long term right now. But I can say that, as always, we strive to improve all the time, whether it's better buying or expense control, we continue to strive to do better.Ernie L. HerrmanBrooke, I would just also jump in what John said earlier in his notes, is that sales have been a driver in helping us to also leverage. And so as we are capturing the sales, we do believe because we've tried to make our store environment sticky for the customer in terms of here, she really having a great experience there as well as the merchandise. These are the 2 primary components of get customers while it captures new customers and get customers back. So we believe momentum doesn't just turn off overnight. So I think part of what we're all feeling internally here is as we've captured new and increased additional visits amidst the market share gain we're getting that, that will be also a margin driver for us as we move forward.OperatorOur next question will come from Mark Altschwager.Mark R. AltschwagerGreat. So maybe just first for John. With respect to the margin guide, if we look at the high end of the guide for Q3 and Q4, it does seem to imply a nice acceleration in Q4. Now I know you've got the benefit from the extra week, you're cycling the shrink accrual so those are some big factors. But I guess, beyond that, maybe what are some of the other factors that we should be mindful of there?John KlingerYes. So as you saw, we did increase the comp. We feel confident about continuing to drive that top line. The other thing that is benefiting us. So in the second quarter and third quarter, we comment on the shrink. So we have just in line with how we accrue, there's an unfavorable impact in the second and third -- first, second and third quarter, and then we have a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. That, along with -- we continue to work on our freight initiatives and continue to try to control those costs as much as we can.Mark R. AltschwagerAnd maybe a follow-up for Ernie. This is the first quarter in a while where both Marmaxx and HomeGoods are contributing to the positive comps. I know there's some noise still with the comparisons in HomeGoods in the back half. But just bigger picture, how should we be thinking about the contribution from HomeGoods versus Marmaxx and a normalized comp algorithm moving forward?Ernie L. HerrmanYes. So Mark, obviously, we won't give the exact comp we're thinking further out. However, we do feel we are really hitting pretty much an inflection point in the HomeGoods business, and we're pretty bullish on the back half here that home will continue to improve on the trend versus the trend that you just saw. We're feeling good about the opportunity to continue to improve in our home mix. And to your point, will continue to contribute to the TJX with a combination of -- with HomeGoods and Marmaxx.Also, just, again, we tend to talk about HomeGoods, specifically, but our home business within our full family stores -- so that's whether in Europe or in Canada and then clearly in T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, our home business there has also -- and those businesses has also improved, also good indicator because we used to talk a few years ago about the fact that home when you roll it all up is a key component of the TJX business. So again, another reason why John and I have talked about as we move forward, that home will continue to be a traffic and sales driver for us over the long term.OperatorOur next question will come from Marni Shapiro.Marni ShapiroCongratulations on a great quarter. If you could just talk a little bit, traffic remains your biggest driver and your marketing has been very, very strong. Can you talk a little bit about has it changed the frequency of how often the shopper is coming to your stores? And are you seeing an increase in your shopper shopping across your different your different boxes. I know you continue to co-locate, but I'm curious if you're seeing that shopper really move from 1 concept to another.John KlingerYes. It's hard for us to read that in detail. Just generally looking at the transaction increases that we have, we believe that we are attracting more new customers to our brands. And when you look at how we're attracting those customers. They tend to be more younger customers, the more Gen Z customers that we're attracting, which we're really excited about because that speaks to the longevity that we see, so.Ernie L. HerrmanYes, Marni, the thing I can tell you, even though we can't get some of that in for -- the ones that are cross-shopping do spend more. So it is a goal of ours to go after that. As John said, we have been attracting a disproportionate number of new Gen Z and millennial shoppers, which is what we really look at in terms of future growth because that's the future higher spend. So when we look out on our strategies for 5 to 7 years, that -- and by the way, we purposely go after that.We do compare -- what we do get at, we can compare our shoppers against some of the competition. There's some general data on that, that we look at. And we've been feeling really good about all gender and age groups to our stores and all the customers that are skewing younger, and that includes in Europe, Australia, domestically.Marni ShapiroAnd then just a quick follow-up, though I do John must be watching Alabama Rush on TikTok because you guys are all over it, and they all shop there, those Gen Zers. But could you just clarify the 53rd week revenue number? I think you said it pretty quickly. I want to make sure I got it down right.Mark R. AltschwagerYes. So the 53rd week is worth 10 basis points to our pretax profit $0.10 to our earnings per share, and it's about $800 million on the top line.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Straton.Alexandra Ann StratonGreat. Congrats on another great quarter, Ernie and John. I think just starting with the guidance from like zooming out here, it looks like you're improving the full year by more than what you guys just beat by. So it seems like you're more optimistic on the back half than maybe you were when we spoke a few months ago. So can you just talk about what the key drivers are their in increased optimism.John KlingerWe beat Q2 by $0.10, and we're beating -- we're increasing the back half by $0.04. -- and that's on increasing the comp from a 2% to 3% to 3% to 4%, given the strength we see in our sales -- and then as far as our freight initiatives, we feel we -- the opportunities that we took in Q2, we're assuming that we continue in back half of the year. And again, we're pulling forward a lot of what we -- within FY '25, but we're really happy to be gaining that benefit this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Bob Drbul.Robert Scott DrbulJust a couple of questions. On apparel and accessories, in terms of what you're seeing and sort of what the consumer is responding to, is there a big change instead of good better best mix that is sort of helping you throughout this quarter and then be the rest of the year?Ernie L. HerrmanGreat question, Bob. Not really a big change again, there has been an amazing -- what I used to script phenomenal availability across really all the areas. I would tell you there are pockets sometimes in categories where we don't get good, better, best as proportionate, but that's our business. So we always know that we're not going to be exact because we're opportunistic in our buying -- our buyers are great on -- in terms of strategically and knowing that they want their mix to be a certain balance depending on the category, by the way.So for example, our buyer and handbags doesn't necessarily want the same ratio of good, better, best, determined by brands, et cetera, the buyer and women's tops, okay? So that varies, but we have been pretty healthy, I would say, other than in certain pockets of certain areas and accessories. It's been a little bit more of an up and down and an imbalance.So we always look at that as an opportunity for the following year because when we have those pockets, as you can see, we just ran a 6 comp. And we still have those pockets of opportunity where we don't have the mix balanced exactly the way we want it to be. and even in some apparel areas. We ran into that in the second quarter that they weren't as strong as they could be if the mix was more balanced and good, better, best, the way that we want it to be.So it's funny, your question brings we could spend a couple of hours on it because we -- and the merchants, we love to talk about how we go about doing that. And we also know that certain quarters, we look better than other quarters. But as you can see in the total picture, we look really strong and the merchants have done across a vast array, and you could never find a quarter where there isn't 1 area that doesn't have a little imbalance. For the most part, really strong balance of good, better, best. Nothing's really changed strategically on that front just a great question you asked.John KlingerAnd by the way, I'll just add to what Ernie said. Our ability to offer good, better and best, I mean, really differentiates us from our competition, and we feel it's a real competitive advantage.Ernie L. HerrmanThat's a great point. I didn't get into that as much on the script. And I know it sometimes in our different investor meetings, we get to talk more about it. But it is I think 1 of the most key strategic advantages we have. A, the fact that our organization is set up to deliver a good, better, best scenario. And if you look, most retailers around us, very few do that. They're not -- they're zeroing in on certain demographic segments or certain, which could include age or fashion looks or different price levels. And we don't do that. And I think that will continue to be a benefit to us over the next 5 to 10 years, huge.OperatorNext, you will hear from Dana Telsey.Dana Lauren TelseyCongratulations on the terrific results. As you think about the real estate as you think about the real estate profile of the store, have you been a beneficiary of any of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations? And is there at all a difference in performance of the stores, suburban or urban? And then lastly, with the improving trend in home goods, how much of that? Or is anything you can green from the elimination of the departure of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, that's also an additive and share enhancement for your home results?Ernie L. HerrmanYes, Dana, thanks for the question. As far as the real estate opportunity, we've been -- we've been on this from the beginning of when retailers start to close stores, and we take the best locations that fit our profile. And we'll continue to do that as we see stores close. As far as the sales and what we've seen, particularly for Marmaxx, we saw very consistent sales performance across income demographic, across geography.And we see ourselves, especially in some of these markets that are more rural is the -- as you see more and more closures as the department store of those areas and see opportunity. So as far as the Bed Bath and Beyond, gaining market share. They've been losing market share for quite a while, and we think we've gained it along the way. So it's sometimes a little bit hard to read that, but we feel that our execution in home has been outstanding, and we've been able to take that market share as it comes up. Yes. So Dana, we think, to John's point, tough to measure, but we feel as though, yes, we are getting from a bed Bath &amp; Beyond or -- but not just those guys, even some of the I believe we're getting some business from the online home retailers as well that have been a little inconsistent in their execution. I think that just creates other opportunities.And then everyone -- that's at the store end for demand, we're talking. The other great not great. The other good thing is it creates additional supply of buying opportunities. We've been talking today about at the retail level, customers we need another place to shop. But for our merchants, they get to take advantage of additional supply and we mean even more now to certain vendors because now they have less places for them to sell their goods. So that's been equally I guess, beneficial.OperatorOur next question comes from Corey Tarlowe.Corey TarloweI had a follow-up on the AUR commentary or ticket I know that it moderated a little bit this quarter. Is the expectation in the guide that it should moderate throughout the rest of the year or perhaps inflect positively as we head into the fourth quarter? And then just as a follow-up on wages. How are you thinking about wages, John, in the outlook throughout the remainder of this year?Ernie L. HerrmanDo you want to take -- I'll start with actually wages. I'll start with wage. Wages, we continue to see that as a headwind in our wages. We're going to be competitive in our wages in every market that we're in. And when we look at our attrition rates, our attrition rates are in line or improving with where they were last year. So we feel really good at where our wage is right now and our ability to attract associates to our company.On the ticket, quarry. So yes, in Q2, we actually didn't moderate. It kind of came in pretty much where we expected. It's as we move to the back half, the ticket, we think, is going to moderate, which is to be down a little less than we were in Q2. However, I always like to qualify this that we do not -- and again, I've talked this way for years, we do not top down, drive our average ticket.So the average ticket, which is really ultimately voted on by the customers, who determine which categories we need to drive hard in the store by supplying them. And we can tell by the way they're selling. And by the way, the market looks so that we'll go after them. It's driven by down at the buyer and merchandise manager level, which is where we really generate.We don't dictate to those teams which categories to have more or less of. That's really driven by consumer demand, which then drives our ticket sometimes because of the mix of the apartments. So right now, we look like we're moderating based on the on order. But if certain opportunities or certain categories get hotter, that could be lower or higher ticket, that could move a little on us. Obviously, Q3, we can project a little better than Q4.So it's always a bit of a touchy one where we don't want to overcommit how firm we are and where the AUR is heading because it's so bottom up by customer demand and buyer driven. Does that make sense?Dana Lauren TelseyYes. That's very helpful.Ernie L. HerrmanYes. But we -- right now, it looks like it is moderating for certainly Q3. .John KlingerAnd what we mean by moderating, down less. And you can see the impact of our top line on the strategy that we've had. I mean, we're offering the customers what they want, and they're coming back.OperatorAnd our final question of the day comes from Adrienne Yih.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantGreat. And it's great to see the acceleration in all divisions actually -- you're welcome. Obviously, my question is probably going to be in inventory. So I actually want to ask not so much about the composition of it, but the buying strategy, off-price buys little bit upfront. We've got great visibility on the open to buy forward looking and then you do a lot of buying sort of intra-season. And so just can you contextualize sort of how that is so different from last year and the advantageous position that is putting you in as you headed to holiday?Ernie L. HerrmanSure, Adrienne. I like the way you framed it all up. So we do not -- obviously, we won't give the percentages by those types of buying pours the way we buy by each one, however, we do buy all those different ways. Right now, we are mission as always, is to pace ourselves on the buying of the in-season closeouts because the market is so loaded.So as we move forward, right now, what we're thinking, Adrienne, is we will pull back even a little bit more on any of the buys that we tend to buy earlier or upfront because all indicators are there will be a continued additional supply, at least over the next 6 to 12 months of what you were just referring to as the in-season closeout type of situation.The packaways is kind of varied. That has become a smaller percent of our business only because, in many cases, the fashion there, if it isn't right, we don't tend to pack it away. But the pattern of what we're seeing right now would tell us we're going to be even a little bit -- and now I'm talking massaging these by just a couple of points. We don't do pendulum swings on our open to buy or how much we do upfront versus leaf for closeouts. Again, the closeouts and the opportunistic side of our business, that's the bulk of our business, and that's what we prioritize. And we see that, I would think, kicking up a notch over the next 6 to 12 months. I hope that answers your question.OperatorThat was our final question of the day.Ernie L. HerrmanOkay. Thank you. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to updating you all again on our third quarter earnings call in November. Take care, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. You may all disconnect. Thank you for participating.]"

Marq Claxton, Director of Black Law Enforcement Alliance and a Former NYPD Officer, tells Yahoo Finance live that ""successful outcomes for the thieves"" is driving the activity. ""Until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these types of activities,"" Claxton said. Claxton says both retailers, legislators, and law enforcement will all need to do their parts to help bring these thefts down. Unfortunately, Claxton says he predicts retail crime ""will continue to escalate and get worse."" Claxton fears that as these robberies become more violent and aggressive, there could end up being fatalities, which could ultimately be what it takes for people to take organized retail crime more seriously.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Target CEO spoke out today in its latest earnings call on the unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized crime. The retail giant among many others continuing to face inventory shrink in relation to rising theft this year. As part of Yahoo Finance's week-long special, ""Retail Evolution-- The New Era,"" we're digging deeper into the legal landscape of retail crime.Here to discuss, we've got Marq Claxton, former NYPD detective and Black Law Enforcement Alliance director. Great to talk to you today. You know, Brooke sort of laid out the problem for us. But that 120% jump number that we heard from Target today really standing out in the first five months of the year. What's driving this?MARQ CLAXTON: A successful outcomes for the thieves. They're in a position now where these type of flash robberies, these smash-and-grabs or they've been called mobberies are very lucrative and very successful for them. So until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these type of activities.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: And what should that look like? When we talk about policies that need to be implemented, what should be the priority there?MARQ CLAXTON: It's a multi-pronged approach. I think one thing for certain is that the commercial establishments have to really get back to the basics and work on increasing the technology that's available for safety. They also have to consider inventory, which was touched on just earlier, about inventory, how much inventory can remain in their stores. And then even work on restructuring interior design and designs of their establishments, using some different materials in order to secure inventory.And then there has to be some work done on the part of legislators. And that may require new legislation or enhanced penalties for existing legislation related to these type of robberies, these type of gang robberies, which is what they are, because, in the drop of a dime, they can turn fatal, because there's a tremendous amount of force being used.And then it has to be a collaborative effort on part of law enforcement, increasing resources. And that's a challenge, given the manpower issues that law enforcement is having across the nation. And then the prosecutor's office have to recognize that this is a disturbing trend that needs to be addressed and dealt with quickly and swiftly. And those individuals who engage in it and who are apprehended must face severe penalties.AKIKO FUJITA: Marq, when you look at some of these smash-and-grabs, it doesn't feel like there are certain items that are being targeted. And yet you just said, this continues because, for those criminals, it is lucrative and successful. I mean, what is that secondhand market look like? Where are they selling to? Where are they making their money?MARQ CLAXTON: Well, we have to be mindful that a lot of these more recent smash-and-grabs are involving more high-end materials, high-end stores. And so, you know, they're making a lot of money in selling to online-- online vendors and other underground kind of backdoor establishments that deal in stolen merchandise on a regular basis. So you have this surge of high-end, very expensive product now being available to these underground resources.SEANA SMITH: So, Marq, how do you crack down then on the third-party sellers here. You know, when we talk about the fact that so many of these items are listed on Amazon, they're listed on Walmart. There was a new law that was passed earlier this summer in an effort to try to stem some of this. But it doesn't sound like that this new Informed Consumers Act is really working that well.MARQ CLAXTON: Well, it's still very early. But I think we're on the right course in as far as holding those people responsible who serve as the second line and passing this merchandise over. I mean, quite frankly, throughout the nation, it is a crime to possess stolen property. So if an individual or a merchant has-- is in possession, knowingly in possession of stolen property, they can be held legally accountable right now. So I think we're in the right-- we're going in the right direction. We're trying to make sure that there's kind of a truth in advertising, if you will, and that merchants are paying-- are more responsible for the product that they bring into their stores.AKIKO FUJITA: Marq, you know, when you look at how this has been handled in California, for example, you have the attorney general, who's now teamed up with some of these retailers to try and crack down on organized crime, I mean, how important do you think it is for law enforcement in retail to essentially partner on this issue, just given the scale of the problem at this point?MARQ CLAXTON: It's vitally important. It's necessary in order to have any kind of impact, any kind of positive impact on decreasing these incidents. Like I said, there has to be this kind of collaborative effort on the part of the commercial establishment, the merchants, the law enforcement, the prosecutor's office, and legislators. And we have to really put additional pressure on those third-party vendors of these items as well. So it's important that there is this collaborative effort in order to stem this tide.SEANA SMITH: Marq, do you think we've seen the worst of it when it comes to retail crime? Or could this be a problem that continues to escalate?MARQ CLAXTON: I'm predicting that it will continue to escalate and get worse. There is a certain boldness that's accompanying many of these smashing robberies. And I think unfortunately, it will get worse. And there will unfortunately be some fatalities at some point, because they're becoming more violent, more aggressive, more frequent with more people. So I'm pretty sure, at some point, there's going to be, you know, regrettably a tragic incident connected to it. And I think at that point, there may be the type of focus that we need to pay attention to what's happening.SEANA SMITH: It certainly needs to be a lot of focus on this issue right now given the risk. Marq Claxton, great to get your perspective. Thanks for joining us.MARQ CLAXTON: Thank you.]"

As high-end retailers struggled with bloated inventories, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Sierra, and Homesense got to offer an even wider assortment of big-name brands as a result. Upon today’s report, shares rose more than 4% to a new 52-week high.Quarterly HighlightsFor the quarter ended on July 29th, the discounting apparel retailer posted a 7.7% YoY rise in sales that amounted to $12.76 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $12.45 billion. Net income also rose from last year’s comparable quarter ($810 million or 69 cents per share) as it amounted to $989 million, or 85 cents per share. Traffic increased across all of its segments.While Home Depot (NYSE: HD) reported a revenue drop as its consumers pulled back on home décor and slashed its outlook in response, TJX even reported its HomeGoods division enjoyed a 4% comparable sales boost. With the rebound in HomeGoods outlets, U.S. comparable sales at Marmaxx expanded 8%. What also helped TJX gain market share in home goods is the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc (OTC: BBBYQ) bankruptcy.Freight costs eased significantly and gross profit margin rose as a result to 30.2%.A Raised Outlook For Fiscal 2024Upon the strong quarter, the discounting retailer of premium brands rose its full-year guidance for comparable store sales, that are expected to rise between 10.7% and 10.8%, and EPS that are now expected in the range between $3.66 and $3.72.Inflation or no inflation, consumers are still willing to splurge – TJX is on a RollTJX’s latest report showed that despite the macroeconomic crunch, consumers are still willing to splurge on discounted premium accessories, clothes and home goods. What the reports of Home Depot, Target and TJX have in common is that they all observed signs of cooling inflation. While full-priced high-end premium retailers struggled with bloated inventories, TJX got to benefit as they offloaded their stock, due to which TJX got to offer a wider assortment than usual. This way, TJX became even more important to high-end brands as it helped them offload their burdening inventories. With its undergoing third quarter off to a very good start, TJX is well positioned to grow its sales and increase customer traffic. It has certainly rejuvenated after a few lackluster quarters with plenty of opportunities coming with the holiday season.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Retail competitor TJX Companies (TJX) posted a beat on earnings and revenue, even raising its full-year outlook. Crypto exchange platform Coinbase (COIN) received regulator approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. customers. Lastly, ArcelorMittal (MT) is reportedly in the middle of considering a potential offer for U.S. Steel (X). Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita highlight several of the day's top stocks after Wednesday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Retail earnings out this week that are telling us a little bit more about the consumer. Before the bell this morning, we heard from Target ending the trading day up nearly 3%. Now they move higher on the profit beat. But ultimately, the retailer slashing its full year profit outlook warning about economic conditions, rising interest rates, and uncertainty from the restart of student loan repayments here.And then on the other hand, we also heard from TJ Maxx that shares there closing up just about 4%. A very strong report from this company, much stronger than the Street, was looking for a full year outlook. Also being raised here to the upside, posting an annual sales jump, also a double digit rise in profits here.So Akiko, we talk a lot about the consumer, the fact that the consumer has remained so resilient in both of these earnings calls here from Target and from TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls there. They were optimistic, but they did say that the next couple of months could be a bit challenging given the fact that some people are pushing off some of their discretionary purchases.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, you hate to pit two companies against each other, but those are two diverging stories right there you just presented. I mean, Target, yes, still offers value, but they are seeing consumers pulling back from discretionary spending. You look at a name like TJX with stores like TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods. I mean, that is where the discounts are. And we are seeing traffic up there in all of the company's divisions that points to where consumers are thinking. Yes, they're turning a little more cautious. They want to spend a little more, but they want value. And that's what this company offers.Story continuesIt's interesting. I'm going back to the conversation we've been having all week, Seana really, as part of our retail special and our focus there. And what we have heard repeatedly is about the value play and consumers really seeking out those items, especially in discount stores, TJX right in the center of that. And that's why we saw a big pop in the stock today on the back of those strong results.Well, shares of Coinbase ending the trading day lower, down just about 2/10 of a percent there. The company says it's secured approval to bring crypto futures to US customers. And Seana, just a reminder, this comes as Coinbase faces off with the SEC, which has alleged that Coinbase has been trading unregistered securities. The company saying that essentially, this approval today does bring a little more regulatory clarity to the crypto space. But interesting to see the reaction on the back of that.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It is interesting when you take to account the fact that the stock actually closed lower. There's still so much uncertainty around Coinbase, that regulatory picture we talked time and time again, about what the timeline looks like for that, when exactly we're going to get a little bit more clarity. And we've heard from a number of investors saying that right now, it's too uncertain. It doesn't make sense to jump in here.But again, when you take a look at Coinbase, their approval here to sell crypto futures and given the popularity on a global basis that we've seen in the derivatives market, you would think that it's obviously good news here for Coinbase. Let's also take a look at the world's second largest steelmaker. ArcelorMittal here is reportedly considering a potential offer for US Steel. And this is according to Reuters. And this coming amid a bidding war already underway for the company following offers from Cleveland-Cliffs, also from Esmark.You're looking at shares of US Steel closing up just over 1.5%. And we know, Akiko, that US Steel has become the target of a couple of companies here, takeover target following several quarters of declines here in terms of sales, in terms of revenue. I think it's too early to know, way too early, of how this is all going to play out and exactly who US Steel is going to favor when it comes to some of these competing offers.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. It's too early to say, but at least we have seen a pop in the stock on the back of these multiple competing offers that have now come in. It's an interesting storyline that we've been talking about, Seana, I think worth repeating. When you think about where the steel industry has gone, we've talked about just how few there are left here. Any kind of consolidation would limit that even further.At the same time, we have seen some strength coming through in steel on the back of those import tariffs that have come in that have essentially sort of pushed out or at least kept at bay Chinese companies that have really been dumping cheap steel there. So we'll see how this all shakes down, but it certainly points to the transition that we are seeing within that industry.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Amgen grew its EPS by 6.6% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Amgen's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While revenue is looking a bit flat, the good news is EBIT margins improved by 2.8 percentage points to 38%, in the last twelve months. That's something to smile about.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Amgen Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Amgen has a market capitalisation of US$142b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$227m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Amgen To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Amgen is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.76%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.52%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.15%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the department store operator had lost 4.15% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.13% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.4% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Macy's as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 22, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.13, down 87% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.04 billion, down 9.91% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.88 per share and revenue of $23.05 billion, which would represent changes of -35.71% and -5.68%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Macy's. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 1.93% lower.

104,4309c1b8-baa8-37d2-898d-5ceaf650fbb3,M,2023-08-17,Kohl's (KSS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kohls-kss-expected-beat-earnings-140008020.html,1692194408,STORY,"['M', 'KSS']","[The market expects Kohl's (KSS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -78.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.91 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.58% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kohl's?For Kohl's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Kohl's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Kohl's would post a loss of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +129.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Kohl's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry, Macy's (M), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the quarter ended July 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -87%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.04 billion, down 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Macy's has been revised 11.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 9.65%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Macy's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

105,7443141a-c3b7-35d3-bbff-e7bd27aa1dd7,GD,2023-08-17,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At General Dynamics (NYSE:GD),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-140013047.html,1692194413,STORY,['GD'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for General Dynamics, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$53b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, General Dynamics has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.5% generated by the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for General Dynamics compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for General Dynamics.So How Is General Dynamics' ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 21% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 11%. Since 11% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, General Dynamics has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 29% return to shareholders who held over that period. So to determine if General Dynamics is a multi-bagger going forward, we'd suggest digging deeper into the company's other fundamentals.If you want to continue researching General Dynamics, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While General Dynamics may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

By reinvesting dividends, growth investors can increase their positions and investing power even quicker. I’m a big advocate of the power of compound interest and reinvesting your dividends amplifies those efforts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor income investors, dividend stocks also are ideal. Holding a selection of quality dividend stocks gives you the opportunity to collect a reliable monthly or quarterly payout that supplements your retirement. That can be really important when inflation is on the rise.F-rated dividend stocks don’t do any of that. Those stocks get the worst ratings from my Dividend Grader tool, which I use to find the best and worst dividend stocks on the market.Holding F-rated dividend stocks is a recipe for disaster. Don’t let it happen to you.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is an up-and-down stock that had a respectable second quarter, returning to profitability after two consecutive quarters of losses. Those weren’t just normal-sized losses. The Q1 debacle was the biggest loss in Intel’s 55-year history.But I’m not ready to say Intel is on the way back. INTC stock gets the bottom rating from the Dividend Grader, coming in at an “F” grade.It’s concerning that Intel’s still showing a 15% drop in revenue on a year-over-year basis. That its margins are down. Or that the company’s Data Center and artificial intelligence revenue dropped 15%. Intel acknowledges it expects additional “softness” in the data center business and stiff competition for AI.Neither of those bodes well for INTC stock.And don’t forget that Intel cut its dividend by 66% in February, making this dividend stock much less appealing even when the stock is on the rise. The current yield is an uninspiring 1.4%.Story continuesMarvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRLV) designs and manufactures semiconductors for carrier, enterprise, data center and automotive platforms. Its chips can be used in cloud applications or on-site.Marvell bulls will point to the company’s first-quarter earnings results, which saw revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of 31 cents, both powered by investor excitement about artificial intelligence.And while MRVL stock went up 32% in that report in late May, what has it done for us lately?Not much. Marvell is down 8% since that earnings report, underperforming technology and semiconductor exchange-traded funds by a significant margin.And if you’re looking for a strong dividend, look elsewhere. MRVL only has a quarterly dividend yield of 6 cents per share, less than 0.5%.You can do much better elsewhere. MRVL stock has an “F” rating in the Dividend Grader.Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT)the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotelSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comHilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT) is a worldwide hospitality company best known for its hotels.Its brands include Hilton, Canopy, Waldorf Astoria, Homewood Suites, Doubletree and Hampton.Overall, it maintains 22 brands with nearly 7,300 properties. Hilton controls more than 1.1 million hotel rooms in 123 countries.The company recorded a top- and bottom-line beat in its Q2 report, posting $2.66 billion in revenue and $1.63 per share earnings. System-wide, it had a 71.3% occupancy rate in the quarter, up 7% from a year ago.But interestingly, the U.S. growth lagged, coming in at 3.9%. European growth and Americas growth outside the U.S. was more than 9%, and Asia Pacific growth was up by 22%.HLT stock is up 22% this year, and maybe perhaps it’s a decent long-term holding. But as a dividend stock, HLT is downright stingy, with a yield of only 0.4%.That’s why this stock gets an “F” rating in the Dividend Grader, despite the company’s recent financial success.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)the Wynn resort in Las VegasSource: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.comCasino stocks like Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were hurt badly by the Covid-19 pandemic and assorted shutdowns. The casino business in Macau still isn’t back all the way, and in-game wagering and other sports betting initiatives haven’t brought in the money that many hoped for in casino stocks.The stock has nearly doubled since its 2020 lows, but recent performance hasn’t been as good. The stock dropped 10% over the last three months amid concerns that investors have already baked Macau profits into the stock price.Second-quarter earnings of $1.6 billion were up from $908.8 million a year ago as the Macau post-Covid recovery accelerated. Income of $105.2 million was an improvement from last year’s loss of $130.1 million.While Wynn’s business may be coming back, the dividend surely isn’t. Before Covid-19, Wynn paid a quarterly dividend of $1 per share. But it suspended its dividend during the pandemic and only came back in May at a paltry 25 cents per share or less than 1% yield.Hopefully, Wynn’s dividend will return at some point, and if it doesn’t, I’m sure the stock’s Dividend Grader rating will improve. But for now, it’s an “F.”Manchester United (MANU)Wide shot photo of Manchester United (MANU) stadium seating at sunset, red seats with white text reading ""Manchester United""Source: shutterstock.com/amirraizatFootball club Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) trades on the New York Stock Exchange, so anyone can get a piece of the famed European club where football greats Ryan Giggs, George Best and Cristiano Ronaldo graced the pitch.That may be fun to do. But is it a good investment? The answer is a clear “no” if you’re looking for dividends.Earnings for the fiscal third quarter ending March 31 included 170 million pounds ($216.2 million), up from 152.8 pounds in the same quarter a year ago. The club reported an operating loss of 4.7 million pounds, an improvement from a loss of 21.8 million pounds a year ago.But unfortunately, the dividend is non-existent. MANU used to be a consistent dividend stock, issuing a 9-cent-per-share payout two times a year. But the last payout was in June 2022, and nothing since then.Can you hear the boo-birds? MANU gets an “F” rating in the Dividend Grader.Spirit AeroSystems (SPR)The Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) website displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comSpirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) manufactures aerostructures for commercial airlines, business and regional jets, and defense platforms. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing (NYSE:BA).Its products include everything from fuselages to wings and wing components, pylons and nacelles. For business and regional jets, Spirit also has an aftermarket business.However, it’s not a profitable business, even with the partnership with Boeing. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. But the company reported an adjusted loss of $1.46 per share, and an operating loss of $120 million, which was greater than the loss of $104.7 million a year ago.Spirit also paid a meager dividend of 1 cent per share until September 2022 but hasn’t paid one since. The stock is down 23% this year and gets an “F”  rating in the Dividend Grader.Big Lots (BIG)Photo of a Big Lots (BIG) store shot from the parking lot with a shopping cart in the foreground and clear blue sky in the background. BIG stockSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is an Ohio-based discount retailer selling toys, clothing, household items, furniture and groceries. It has more than 1,400 locations.But it’s been a struggle for Big Lots in 2023. While the company should be doing well in an inflationary environment. People looking to stretch their dollars typically shop at discount retailers.Instead, Big Lots suffered from greater costs, higher interest rates and supply chain issues. Customers also saw lower tax refunds from the 2022 tax year, which affected their spending in Big Lots stores.Unfortunately for dividend investors, Big Lots responded to these pressures by suspending its 30-cent-per-share dividend.Big Lots is a big disappointment if you’re looking for yield.

PDCO scaled a new 52-week high of $34.46 on Aug 15, before closing the session slightly lower at $33.83.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 14.5% compared with the 11.2% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 4.2% growth.Over the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 6% compared with the industry’s 8.8% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 9.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.2%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.5%.Patterson Companies is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversBroad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock-keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about Patterson Companies’ strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In December 2022, Patterson Companies announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.DownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree which is improving its revenue opportunities, but aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management, which is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen the company’s risk profile, going forward.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and McKesson Corporation MCK.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.5%.

LKQ.Industry: Auto PartsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2136841/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-riding-the-industrys-optimismAging vehicles are a key catalyst for the bright prospects of the Zacks Automotive Replacement Parts industry. In a bid to ensure the sustained operability of their older vehicles, consumers are opting to invest in the substitution of defective parts and constituents. Additionally, integration of e-commerce and soaring popularity of technologically advanced vehicles are revolutionizing the industry. However, commodity cost inflation, forex woes and logistical challenges may pose concerns. Industry participants like Genuine Parts Company and LKQ Corp. stand out favorably due to their strategic acquisitions and investor-friendly initiatives.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts.The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Factors at PlayVehicle Longevity a Key Driver: According to the S&amp;P Global Mobility report released in May, the mean age of automobiles in the United States reached 12.5 years in 2023. This marks the sixth consecutive year of rise in the average age of vehicles and the most substantial annual upturn since the recession of 2008-2009. The escalated pace of the average light vehicle age's growth brings advantages to the automotive replacement sector. A more aged collection of vehicles implies an ongoing requirement for repair and maintenance to uphold proper functionality.Story continuesTypically aligned with the advancement in the mean vehicle age, the industry's course is experiencing growth, as consumers allocate more resources to sustain the operation of their maturing automobiles. Consequently, there has been a noticeable upsurge in the demand for automotive replacement parts.New Opportunities Arising from Technology: The automotive sector is experiencing a transformative shift, driven by the widespread integration of cutting-edge technology and swift digitization, resulting in a complete overhaul of the market landscape. This transformation has opened up new growth avenues for the auto replacement parts industry. As the electrification and autonomous driving trends gain momentum, industry participants are redoubling their efforts to engineer technologically sophisticated components.Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced technologies and components that may require replacement over time. This includes electronic systems, sensors and other specialized parts that contribute to the growth of replacement part demand.Digitization Ramp up: The surge of e-commerce and online retail has reshaped the auto replacement parts industry by providing unprecedented accessibility, diversity of options and convenience for consumers. Through online platforms, customers can easily compare a wide array of replacement parts, read reviews, and access comprehensive product information, enabling informed purchasing decisions. The global reach of e-commerce allows customers to source specialized parts from various regions. This digital transformation benefits both “Do-It-Yourself” enthusiasts and professional mechanics, streamlining the process of finding and acquiring the necessary components. Overall, e-commerce has empowered consumers, expanded market access, and revolutionized the industry's growth trajectory by enhancing customer engagement and choice.Cost-Related Challenges are Concerning: The emergence of highly advanced automotive components is exerting notable pressure on the profit margins of auto replacement parts. Escalating commodity costs compound these issues and could potentially undermine profitability. Additionally, the widespread international footprint of many industry participants renders them vulnerable to foreign exchange complexities. Adverse currency conversions might affect earnings and margins. Moreover, the industry is contending with logistical hurdles and supply chain disruptions, which serve to further curtail potential growth prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #79, which places it in the top 31% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of the year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 2.3% north.Before we present two stocks from the industry worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has declined 9%, narrower than the sector’s decline of 18.8%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 5.4% over the same timeframe.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 8.7X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 13.45X and the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 12.07X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 9.33X.2 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnGenuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland.Genuine Parts’ strategic buyouts to improve product offerings and expand its geographical footprint are boosting its prospects. The KDG acquisition has strengthened Genuine Parts’ market-leading position of North American industrial platform.Other strategic bolt-on acquisitions, including Winparts, Rare Spares, PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group are adding to the top-line growth of the Automotive segment. The recent acquisition of Gaudi has expanded GPC’s European automotive footprint. The company's dividend aristocrat status is commendable. The upbeat 2023 sales and earnings view further sparks optimism. Genuine Parts projects 2023 revenues from both the Automotive and Industrial segments to increase by 4-6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 5.6% and 4.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 10.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Genuine Parts — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B — topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 7.10%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.LKQ: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. LKQ’s strategic acquisitions are boosting its prospects. The acquisition of Uni-Select Inc. for $2.1 billion, completed on Aug 1, 2023, is set to bolster its global automotive vehicle parts distribution business.Synergistic acquisitions in July, including that of a U.S. remanufacturer and distributor of engines, a leading UK truck parts distributor, a Holland-based automotive parts distributor, a Belgium-based automotive parts and accessories business, and an aftermarket accessories distributor in Texas and Oklahoma bode well. Its strategic partnership with Mobivia is expected to boost LKQ’s Europe unit prospects. Strong cash flow and investor-friendly moves are boosting shareholders’ confidence. The company’s North American and European segments have been performing well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 6.3% and 7.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 and 2024 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 4% and 10%, respectively. LKQ— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and having a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, with the average surprise being 1.5%.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

116,0bd212fa-7bd4-33a4-b234-cf1dad05d49d,TSN,2023-08-17,Exclusive-Tyson Foods plans to sell China poultry business -sources,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tyson-foods-plans-sell-052223547.html,1692249743,STORY,"['TSN', 'GS']","[By Kane Wu and Abigail SummervilleHONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. meat and processed food maker Tyson Foods plans to sell its China poultry business, three people with knowledge of the matter said, in the latest case of a multinational firm looking to divest from the country in recent years.The company has hired Goldman Sachs to advise on the sale and sent preliminary information to potential buyers including a number of private equity firms, said two of the people, adding the sale process was at an early stage.While it was not immediately clear what valuation Tyson Foods is seeking for the China poultry business, it has annual sales of about $1.1 billion, one of the people said.Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The sources, who did not say why Tyson was planning to sell the business, declined to be identified because the information was confidential.Calls to Tyson Foods' China headquarters in Shanghai went unanswered.Tyson said this month it was evaluating all operations and closing four more U.S. chicken plants in the latest bid to reduce costs after its third-quarter revenue and profit missed Wall Street expectations.China's meat market has become increasingly challenging, with livestock farm margins squeezed in the last two years due to weak demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased feed prices because of the Russia-Ukraine war, analysts have said.A string of multinational firms have divested their China businesses or pared their holdings in the last few years as some found it hard to reap desired profits amid the country's slower economic growth, strong local competition or geopolitical headwinds, according to bankers.Foreign companies have divested a combined $8.4 billion of Chinese assets across all sectors so far this year, following $13.5 billion of disposals in 2022, Dealogic data showed.In the food industry, U.S. agricultural giant Cargill struck a deal in May to sell its China poultry business to private equity firm DCP Capital for an undisclosed price.Story continuesBritish consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser Group in 2021 sold its China infant formula and child nutrition business to investment firm Primavera Capital Group for an enterprise value of $2.2 billion.Dutch dairy cooperative FrieslandCampina kicked off the sale of its Friso infant nutrition brand in December 2021 but has yet to find a buyer. It sold an infant-formula factory in China to local peer Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group in July 2022.Major Chinese feed and meat producer New Hope Liuhe last month told investors it was reviewing its businesses and considering bringing strategic investors in its poultry and food businesses, in a bid to lower its debt-to-asset ratio.Tyson Foods opened its first factory in China in 2001 and now has four research and development centres, several processing plants and dozens of breeding farms in the country, according to its website for China operations.It operates throughout the industry chain in China, from breeding and slaughtering to processing and distribution, providing chicken, beef, pork and processed foods.The company in June launched a new factory focusing on processed foods such as cooked chicken and pre-made Chinese cuisine in the eastern Chinese city of Nantong and another that focuses on frozen and heat-processed foods in the central Chinese city of Xiaogan, the website showed.Tyson Foods reported $39.5 billion in total sales for the nine months ended July 1, of which $1.9 billion was from the international and other business segment that includes its China operations.(Reporting by Kane Wu in Hong Kong, Abigail Summerville in New York and Roxanne Liu in Beijing; Additional reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

She wanted to expand her business, but as a cash-only operation, couldn’t show banks that she was a worthy investment. An initiative called Project Kirana, launched by Mastercard and its partners, helped Renu adopt digital payments, creating the formal transaction history that would show her business was booming.Renu is one of the 25 million women entrepreneurs we’ve reached with business solutions since 2020, fulfilling a global pledge to bring greater opportunities to women who have been on the wrong side of the digital divide for too long.Measuring the number of women shop owners in India who went digital is the easy part. But how do you calculate the value of financially empowering a generation of women and creating role models for the generations to come? And more broadly, how do you measure any social impact project to show its economic benefits and that it reached its intended goals?By comparison, measurements for environmental projects are fairly mature by now, with multiple levels of analysis available to drill down the direct and succeeding impacts of sustainability initiatives. The lack of similar metrics and tools for social programs means a lot of good work in this field goes unrecognized and businesses will have less incentive to invest in them. Additionally, it’s likely that more precise measurements could direct investments of time and money to more effective programs.A vacuum of credible information about these programs invites skepticism about them. Critics can-and do-say, “What good are they if we can’t measure their success?”These programs do matter a great deal. In the decade since I helped launch the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, I’ve seen our financial inclusion work empower people, strengthen communities and build a more sustainable digital economy. What I love about Renu’s story is not just her shop’s digital transformation, but the way it has also transformed her life. As her business grows, her husband has taken on more responsibilities in the home, nudging social norms toward greater equity. We need better metrics to illustrate those types of changes to businesses, the public, and critics.Story continuesIf we can develop principles for capturing the social contributions companies are making, we can help businesses take action while carrying out their strategic objectives and creating long-term value for shareholders.To measure social impact, we could start by using the tools we already have.In the environmental context, companies have adopted the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, which tracks the full spectrum of a company’s carbon emissions. The first scope accounts for direct emissions from its operations, the second relates to indirect emissions from energy purchased by the company, and the third tracks indirect emissions from a company’s entire value chain.At the Center for Inclusive Growth, we have been thinking about how to capture social impact in a similarly methodical way. Just as the environmental framework is tied to the level of control over the source of emissions, we could account for the level of control in social impact. I’ll offer up the following framework to show how our team is thinking about this challenge, so we can help spark a dialogue using the following as a conceptual starting point.The first scope could cover each company’s approach toward its own employees, since companies have a direct influence on this stakeholder group through workplace investments, programs, and corporate culture. This category could assess pay equity, diversity within leadership ranks, talent development and career progression for underrepresented groups, labor standards, and more. Many companies already track these metrics.Then, the second scope could look at how companies leverage their core competencies, deploy their products and services and work within their supply chains to help address societal challenges. Companies have skills, technologies, and capital that can create widespread social benefits, and many are already leading the way. The activity in this second category involves stakeholders at a level of control that is less direct than the first, such as customers and suppliers.Finally, philanthropic giving, volunteering, and other community investments would comprise the third scope. This level of control is distinct from the second scope because company resources are entrusted to other entities that make decisions about how it’s spent. These efforts, while indirect, can strengthen a company’s brand and reputation, cultivate innovation and opportunity, and generate significant societal value.From there, it’s about measuring the outputs of our investments in all three scopes. A system of accountability for follow-through is vital because when it comes to improving people’s lives, communities, and futures, outcomes matter-not just effort.There is so much good work happening in the social impact space, but much more work to be done to measure it. To incentivize continued progress, we have to start quantifying the impact, even if the best way to do that looks different across companies or industries.By sparking a discussion that influences innovation, promotes transparency and accountability, and inspires more companies to apply the full range of their assets for positive social impact, we can demonstrate the true power of the private sector, which is needed now more than ever.Shamina Singh is the founder and president of Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:The FIRE movement is soaring in popularity–but early retirees report feeling lost and unfulfilledAmerica turned to hospital-at-home programs during the pandemic–but their stunning success calls for a permanent fix‘The Feckless 400’: These companies are still doing business in Russia–and funding Putin’s warDaniel Lubetzky: ‘You can’t make big ESG commitments while failing at the basics of kindness’This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Only Visa can unlock the token.DoJ officials have now begun to investigate Visa's policy of charging retailers more if they choose not to use this technology, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The probe is the latest development in a more than two-year investigation by the DoJ into allegations that Visa is attempting to monopolize the debit card market.Shares in Visa were little changed in early trading.San Francisco-based Visa argues that the technology, which it first introduced in 2014, helps protect digital payments as cardholder information passes from merchants to banks. More than 4 billion tokens have now been issued, with 13,000 retailers using the service.Spokespeople for Visa and Justice Department officials declined to comment, Bloomberg said.According to a document seen by Bloomberg, merchants were informed in recent weeks that Visa and its partners would be rolling out routine fee adjustments.In particular, the new plan would charge merchants higher rates if they chose not to use Visa's tokenization technology than if they opted in to the service, the documents cited by Bloomberg showed. Sources told Bloomberg that this announcement is what revived the DoJ's interest in tokenization.The report comes after Visa peer Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reached a settlement in December with the Federal Trade Commission over its tokenization practices. Mastercard was alleged to have used the technology to prevent merchants from using alternate payment networks. It ultimately agreed to grant these alternate networks access to customers' personal account details.Story continuesRelated ArticlesVisa faces Justice Department probe into 'token' pricing - BloombergIsrael stocks lower at close of trade; TA 35 down 0.35%ViaSat's Inmarsat acquisition a positive, but ViaSat-3 complications 'pose a meaningful headwind' - JPMorgan]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned +8.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 9.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.29 indicates a change of +5% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.9 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $100.11 billion and $103.24 billion estimates indicate +5.5% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $25.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.3%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +7.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.76% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.52%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.15%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device company had lost 4.34% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's gain of 2.19% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.4% in that time.Medtronic will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 22, 2023. On that day, Medtronic is projected to report earnings of $1.11 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 1.77%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.57 billion, up 2.67% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.04 per share and revenue of $32.16 billion, which would represent changes of -4.73% and +2.97%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Medtronic currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Looking at its valuation, Medtronic is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 16.42. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 21.23, which means Medtronic is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesInvestors should also note that MDT has a PEG ratio of 2.67 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MDT's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.78 as of yesterday's close.The Medical - Products industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 106, putting it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S and Medtronic plc.

The stock has done better than the equal-weighted version of index, given the strong performance of a few megacap Tech stocks.The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 11.1% year-over-year growth.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid its overall performance. It reported solid fiscal third-quarter results thanks to higher cross-border volumes. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress its margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. Its volumes are likely to see diminishing effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As such, it warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+71.3% vs. +22.7%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the market.

Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view along with its second-quarter results, expecting better sales of its GLP-1 diabetes products. Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging.However, competition is getting stiffer from pharma bigwigs like Pfizer, who are likely to eat away from Novo Nordisk’s Diabetes care market share.

After all, doing the right thing in our personal lives usually comes at a cost; either a direct one or a cost associated with a lack of recognition of upright behavior or action.However, investing in ESG stocks does not need to be a binary affair, where winning in the moral field leads to losses in the portfolio. According to the Harvard Business Review, going the sustainable or responsible route can pay off. It stands to reason, then, that investors may also benefit. Thus, this framework provides additional impetus for must-buy ESG stocks.To be fair, it’s possible to overdo it. According to a Wall Street Journal article earlier this year, companies which remain neutral on social or political issues outperform enterprises that lean left. At the same time, American society is becoming more liberal over the past half-century. Over time, people expect more from business entities, which is why leading ESG stocks could thrive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, doing good nets positive PR. On that note, below are top ESG stocks for August.Valvoline (VVV)VVV stock: a valvoline sign with a white background and blue and red accentsSource: ricochet64/Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Valvoline (NYSE:VVV), which specializes in automotive retail services like oil changes, might seem an odd idea for best ESG stocks to buy. After all, hydrocarbon extraction processes aren’t exactly known for their environmentally friendly profile.Nevertheless, the company is apparently quite serious about its sustainability and product stewardship initiatives. As well, Valvoline committed itself to the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. It’s not just cheap marketing rhetoric either. Last year, Valvoline ranked number 41 in Investor Business Daily’s 100 Best ESG Companies list.Fundamentally, VVV represents one of the top ESG stocks for August because of its rising relevance. With the average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways hitting a record 12.5 years, people are holding onto their rides for longer than ever. That’s going to benefit auto maintenance centers.Story continuesFinally, analysts peg VVV a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target lands at $41.33, implying nearly 18% upside potential. Thus, it makes a strong case for leading ESG stocks.Merck (MRK)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA multinational pharmaceutical company, Merck (NYSE:MRK) organically slides in as one of the best ESG stocks to buy. Basically, the fundamental nature of the business is to help people. In particular, Merck is a powerhouse in the field of oncology. Over the training one-year period, MRK gained 19% of equity value.Like other high-profile enterprises, Merck takes its views on sustainability and responsibility to people and communities seriously. In particular, the big pharma firm collaborates with key stakeholders to ensure that its scientific innovations are accessible and affordable to those in need. As well, it conducts research in infectious diseases and vaccine development, thus empowering underprivileged communities.Last year, Merck ranked as number nine in Investor Business Daily’s 100 Best ESG Companies list. What’s especially appealing about those interested in investing in ESG stocks is that Merck also benefits from a viable northbound pathway. Right now, analysts peg MRK as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $126, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comAn American agribusiness and food company, Bunge (NYSE:BG) also offers an organic case for best ESG stocks to buy. As a critical component of the food supply chain – with the company involved in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer – Bunge has an incentive to lead from the front regarding sustainability and responsibility.Unsurprisingly, Bunge features a cohesive directive regarding its sustainability initiatives. Per its website, the company commits to three core pillars: action on climate, responsible supply chains and accountability. Earlier this year, the company generated headlines for its program to drive regenerative agriculture in Brazil. One of the highlights of the program is that it will be offered at no cost to farmers.Last year, Bunge ranked as number 18 in Investor Business Daily’s 100 Best ESG Companies list. It was also the top-ranked agriculture-related enterprise by a country mile. Looking to the Street, analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $135, implying nearly 20% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $80 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well-poised to gain, and hence, investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.Story continuesMPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to buy back the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies: It is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $322.5 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Sep 30, 2026. Work related to the deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.Importance of TOW missileRTX’s TOW weapon system, with the multi-mission TOW 2B, enables ground forces to overpower adversary armored and wheeled systems, regardless of the environment or conditions. It provides a combat proven capability to the Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle development program while maintaining compatibility with the existing launch platforms.With its extended range performance, the TOW missile is the long-range precision, heavy anti-tank and assault weapon system of choice for the U.S. Army Stryker, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, ITAS High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Light Armored Vehicle-Anti-tank platforms.The fact that this weapon system is currently deployed with more than 40 international armed forces and integrated on more than 15,000 ground, vehicle and helicopter platforms surely reflects the solid demand that it enjoys in the missile market. The latest contract win by RTX is a bright example of that.What’s Ahead?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and RTX being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.Looking ahead, per a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the 2022-2030 period to reach $84.2 million by 2030. Such massive growth projections indicate solid opportunities for RTX, which has a handful of combat proven missiles in its product portfolio, like Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T), the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) and a few more, in addition to the TOW missile.Story continuesPeer ProspectsConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global rocket and missile market, other major defense primes like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Boeing BA that specialize in developing technologically advanced missiles should also benefit.Northrop Grumman’s missile defense program includes AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation guided missiles, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system and rocket propulsion systems. In August 2022, the company had been chosen by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to lead the Homeland Missile Defense Program.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales implies an improvement of 5.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed Martin’s missile defense program includes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs. It also manufactures the Multiple Launch Rocket System, the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Javelin tactical missile programs alongside other tactical missiles.LMT boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.04%.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Cigna Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Cigna GroupNotably, that recent sale by Mary Terese Hoeltzel is the biggest insider sale of Cigna Group shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$289. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Cigna Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Cigna Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Cigna Group. In total, Senior VP of Tax &amp; Chief Accounting Officer Mary Terese Hoeltzel sold US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Cigna Group Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Cigna Group insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$338m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Cigna Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Cigna Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Cigna Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Cigna Group you should be aware of.But note: Cigna Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Work related to the deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.Importance of TOW missileRTX’s TOW weapon system, with the multi-mission TOW 2B, enables ground forces to overpower adversary armored and wheeled systems, regardless of the environment or conditions. It provides a combat proven capability to the Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle development program while maintaining compatibility with the existing launch platforms.With its extended range performance, the TOW missile is the long-range precision, heavy anti-tank and assault weapon system of choice for the U.S. Army Stryker, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, ITAS High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle and Light Armored Vehicle-Anti-tank platforms.The fact that this weapon system is currently deployed with more than 40 international armed forces and integrated on more than 15,000 ground, vehicle and helicopter platforms surely reflects the solid demand that it enjoys in the missile market. The latest contract win by RTX is a bright example of that.What’s Ahead?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy.

During last quarter's results, over a dozen retailers pointed to theft as a key reason behind slashing their profit outlook. And Target was front and center predicting $500 million in expected losses from organized retail crime in 2023.For more on this, we're joined by Marty Andrews, VF Corp vice president of loss prevention. Marty, great to have you here with us, especially on this topic here and considering the role. How should consumers think about and investors think about, more notably here, the impact that shrink or loss have on some of the companies and how much this has grown over the years?Story continuesMARTY ANDREWS: Yeah, so we've seen a significant uptick in organized retail crime, and it's certainly impacting the profits of organizations. So I think the big thing that the consumers out there need to understand is the difference between organized retail crime and shoplifting. Shoplifting is oftentimes minimized as someone goes in and takes a pack of gum or a candy bar. So we need to educate folks on what organized retail crime actually is. And these are individuals and groups going into stores stealing massive amounts of quantities of merchandise in various stores day in and day out. So that thought process of these are big organizations and they're insured and it's not a big deal, we need to change that narrative.- So Marty, I want to ask you about, there was a viral video recently of a huge, and to your point, organized crime event it appeared for Nordstrom was targeted. About $100,000 of merchandise was stolen at an LA Nordstrom. There have been questions about, what is the solution to this growing problem when it comes to shrink, which again, to your point is more than just shoplifting? What are the solutions that you're hearing on the table?MARTY ANDREWS: Well, that's the big thing that we're trying to battle, right? How do we do this? And I think one of the big things is we're decriminalized some of the activities. So there has to be a punishment for these crimes otherwise, people are going to continue to do them if it's a misdemeanor to go in and do these types of behaviors.So we have to get that. We have to get law enforcement's support in these. And of course, there's limited law enforcement resources nowadays. So some of the things that I'm involved with and that are being done out there, as you mentioned, the RILA, NRF, they're great organizations that are bringing retailers together. We're actually working closely with district attorneys. And retailers are working collaboratively to these.We can't work in a silo, many of these individuals are going to multiple retail locations. So if we can work together and show that this isn't someone coming in and shoplifting one time, they're shoplifting multiple times, multiple times in a day, going to different states, we're getting more traction on those cases. So it's an education process for everyone involved. But it's going to take time, and it's going to take resources and definitely collaboration.- I mean, are we just heading towards even more of the plexiglass wave to have an associate come over and get a product off the shelf for you if we don't see a massive change in the amount of retail theft that's taking place?MARTY ANDREWS: Well, we're seeing some retailers out there doing that and of course, that impacts that consumer interaction. That's why people are going to retail stores, they want to be around the merchandise, they want to touch it, they want to have those interactions. So it's a fine line of how do you get that great consumer experience, but how do you protect your product? So there's a balancing act there. Of course, you're working with different partners within the organization to figure out where you want to draw the line and how you want to run your organization.- And to your point about where you want to draw the line, how does staffing account for deal with these issues? Because you have some retailers who are like, they beef up security but some say, don't even get involved when you have something like this occurring. How can staffing play out in terms of helping to address this issue?MARTY ANDREWS: So staffing is important, security is important but you have to figure out, again, where you're going to draw the line in those areas. So we want to keep people safe. First and foremost, I think every retailer out there would say that. So it is a different environment in a retail store these days, and we have to continually coach on de-escalation and making sure that we're not putting our people in harm's way.So if we can educate folks that we need to stand back, we need to be safe, and then we can work that on the back end from a loss prevention standpoint where we grabbed the video and work with law enforcement and build those cases and seek prosecution.- Do you see this changing the type of inventory that is sold in stores versus perhaps a skew that might be forced to go online only if a retailer is assuming that there could be a higher risk or assessing a higher risk towards a certain product being stolen?MARTY ANDREWS: I haven't heard of anything specifically regards to that. I think we're all sitting around a table and discussing what measures we're going to take. I don't think anything is off the table. You have to discuss it all and take a look at everything and make those best choices to run your business.- And is there the potential for this to get worse before it gets better when you think about thieves becoming more brazen, targeting-- I've seen some data targeting warehouses and distribution center before it even gets to the retailer. Is there the potential for that, Marty?MARTY ANDREWS: Absolutely. Things are happening in transit before it even makes its way to the retail store. So the threat really starts from the point that it leaves the warehouse all the way till it gets to the retail store. So definitely many issues along the way that have to be assessed and continuing to look for different measures and different technologies. There's a lot of good technology providers out there that are working on this issue as well with us side by side.- Marty, it was interesting how you were kind of beginning to quantify how it changes the customer experience. Have we been able to really quantify the difference or the shift in a company's net promoter score even because of a change in that in-person shopping experience as a result of the changes now that have had to take place in order to curb the amount of theft?MARTY ANDREWS: Yeah, and I think that the incident that you were talking about earlier that happened over the weekend, I saw an interview with a consumer that was talking about not feeling safe going to that environment. So that's a scary place for us as retailers. We have to work with the malls, we have to work with law enforcement to bring that safety and that comfort back that I can go to the mall and I can be safe and I can have a good consumer experience.- It's a tough situation across the board. We will have to leave it there for now. Thank you so much, Marty Andrews VF Corporation vice president of loss prevention. Thank you, Marty.]"

The civil action against UBS was filed in 2018, alleging misconduct with regard to the underwriting, issuance and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) that were issued in 2006-2007.UBS said that the entire settlement has been provisioned in prior periods.This case was filed against UBS after an extensive investigation that held UBS responsible to have defrauded investors in connection with the sale of 40 RMBS during the said period. UBS was alleged of violated Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) by knowingly making false and misleading statements to the buyers of these securities regarding characteristics of the mortgage loans underlying RMBS.The government held that UBS had knowledge about significant numbers of loans which backed RMBS did not comply with loan underwriting guidelines. Further, UBS was well aware that a number of securitized loans were unsupported by the property values associated with them. Also, a high number of loans were not originated in compliance with the consumer protection laws.Since UBS had carried out extensive due diligence on the underlying loans before it had issued RMBS, it was aware of major problems.  Hence, ultimately, those 40 RMBS did sustain substantial losses.With this settlement, the U.S. DOJ has successfully collected more than $36 billion in civil penalties in respect to alleged misconduct by various entities. These were connected with the failure of RMBS that ultimately led to 2008 financial crisis.Since UBS’s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, it has been facing legal hassles and operational challenges. This week, individual shareholders and former employees of Credit Suisse are expected to lodge a claim in Zurich’s commercial court.

If true, it would leave Zenit Bank at risk of a loss relating to a loan made in October 2021.Court documents showed that the Russian bank joined an agreement to provide a syndicated loan to Luxembourg-based agricultural firm, Intergrain, for which Credit Suisse was the credit agent.In November 2021, Zenit Bank transferred $20 million to Intergrain. However, after Western sanctions were imposed on Zenit Bank, Credit Suisse notified the Russian bank that it would not transfer payments to it from Intergrain.Documents showed that Zenit Bank filed for interim measures, asking the court to seize funds belonging to UBS and Credit Suisse and prohibiting the disposal of shares.Notably, Zenit Bank’s request to seize funds was not granted and a further court hearing is scheduled for Sep 14.Since the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, UBS has been facing legal hassles and operational challenges.

Making the right decisions can yield bountiful rewards, while wrong turns can lead to substantial setbacks. There lie hidden gems for those equipped with the right insight and patience. One such treasure is the world of undervalued biotech stocks. These aren't simply low-priced stocks but genuine biotech opportunities teeming with potential.Understanding the Biotech MarketWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PFE. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?However, when we speak of ""cheap"" stocks, it's crucial to distinguish between a genuine bargain and a sinking investment. The biotech market is marked by its volatility, swayed by regulatory verdicts, clinical trial outcomes, and broader market movements. Intelligent investments in this space arent just about snatching up the lowest-priced stock; it's about discerning its intrinsic worth. It's about proactive decision-making, discerning genuine value from the surrounding noise.Methodology for Selecting Biotech StocksIn curating picks for this list, I took advantage of the GuruFocus All-In-One Screener. Initially, I filtered for biotech stocks, narrowing it further to dividend-paying ones. Dividend payout ratios were assessed to gauge the dividends sustainability. Attention then pivoted to the Return on Equity (ROE) an indicator of how well a company leverages shareholder equity to generate profit. Finally, we are interested in undervalued picks for this list, so we ensured to include only those companies that are not overpriced compared to the market. To achieve this, we selected stocks with a forward P/E ratio below most of the stocks peers. This way, we know we are getting more value for our money.Story continuesScouting for Biotech BargainsSo, if you're scouting for true biotech bargains, you're right where you should be. The classic investment wisdom tells us to ""buy low, sell high,"" but here, it's all about purchasing with prudence. Let's delve deep into the biotech landscape, spotlighting those stocks that, while overlooked, are bursting with potential.Overview of Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc (PFE, Financial) has experienced a decline of about 31% year-to-date, raising concerns for many investors. Yet, a closer look at its second quarter 2023 results reveals a glimmer of hope. While revenue dropped to $12.73 billion, marking a 54% decrease from the previous year, and net income took a hit, dropping about 77% to $2.33 billion, Pfizer astonishingly exceeded its June 2023 EPS estimates by an impressive 15%. This could suggest a company adept at navigating challenges.Pfizer's Legacy and Dividend ProwessIn the tumultuous realm of biotech stocks, Pfizer's legacy stands resolute. Beyond the figures, we're talking about the powerhouse behind innovations like Viagra, Lipitor, and the groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. As the biopharma sector gears up for its biggest M&amp;A year since the pandemic, now might be an opportune moment for savvy investors to eye biotech bargains. Especially given current events, such as the World Health Organization's focus on the EG.5 strain and potential pharmaceutical industry shifts from drug price negotiation bills, a dependable giant like Pfizer presents a compelling choice.Don't sleep on Pfizer's dividend prowess, either. Although not a Dividend Aristocrat, Pfizer is gearing up to pay its 338th quarterly dividend in Q2 2023. Impressively, Pfizer has hiked its dividends for 14 consecutive years. In the Drug Manufacturers sector, PFE's 4.58% dividend yield outshines 90.67% of 493 competitors, notably higher than the industry's median of 1.71%. With a dividend payout ratio of 0.43, there's promising room for continued growth.Pfizer's Return on Equity and ValuationMoreover, Pfizer distinguishes itself in the Drug Manufacturers sector, boasting an outstanding Return on Equity (ROE). With an ROE of 22.58%, it outperforms 92.86% of the 1023 companies in the industry, showcasing its dedication to delivering substantial shareholder returns.From a valuation standpoint, Pfizer's Forward Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio is 10.77. This makes it more appealing than about 77.42% of the 124 companies in the Drug Manufacturers sector. This ratio is a crucial metric, signifying market expectations for a company's future earnings growth, further emphasizing Pfizer's competitive edge in valuation.In summary, for those scouting for undervalued biotech stock options, Pfizer deserves a spot on your radar.Overview of Gilead Sciences Inc (NASDAQ:GILD)The biotech sector is renowned for its volatile nature, with companies regularly experiencing swift value surges followed by sharp downturns. Even Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD, Financial), a giant in biotech, hasn't escaped such fluctuations. The stock is down by almost 9% year-to-date, possibly hinting at an opportunity for discerning investors. Often, these declines are golden opportunities for astute investors to seize, scouting for biotech bargains that promise long-term returns.Gilead's Financial Performance and Strategic AgilityDespite a somewhat turbulent first quarter in 2023 for Gilead, which saw a 5% revenue increase to $6.60 billion but a 9% dip in net income, there's a brighter side. The company's net change in cash skyrocketed by an impressive 73% to $768 million. Such liquidity retention could be pivotal for future investments and collaborations. Gilead's recent $800 million deal with Cognizant proves its strategic agility during tough times.Gilead's Return on Equity and Dividend YieldIn terms of profitability, Gilead Sciences shines with a Return on Equity (ROE) of 26.19%, showcasing its adeptness at converting shareholder equity into profits. This stellar financial indicator positions Gilead favorably in the Drug Manufacturers sector. Gilead outpaces about 94.92% of the 1023 companies evaluated in the same industry, emphasizing its prowess in offering value to shareholders and its significance in the pharma world.With a Dividend Yield of 3.69%, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) emphasizes its dedication to its investors. This yield places GILD ahead of 82.76% of 493 competitors in the cutthroat Drug Manufacturers industry. Though the current payout ratio is a tad high at 0.68, ample room remains for growth, highlighting Gilead's effective resource allocation for dividends and operational reinvestment.Gilead's ValuationFinally, lets address the topic of valuation. Shares of the biopharmaceutical company are currently trading at an enticing Forward PE Ratio of 11.47. When compared within the Drug Manufacturers industry, GILD's valuation stands out as it is ranked better than 74.19% of the 124 companies in the sector. This positions the company favorably in terms of its valuation relative to many of its peers.In summary, as the adage states, ""Every cloud has a silver lining."" For savvy biotech investors, this brief dip might be their chance to invest in a company set for upward trajectories. After all, Gilead isn't just forging strong alliances; it's adeptly adjusting to the fluctuating market dynamics.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It is intended for heavily pre-treated patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Continued approval of the drug will be based on verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study.The drug, to be marketed by the name of Elrexfio, is the first off-the-shelf (ready-to-use) fixed-dose subcutaneous BCMA-CD3-targeted agent to be approved in the United States. It has the option to be dosed every other week in the long term after 24 weeks of weekly treatment.Pfizer’s stock has declined 31% so far this year against an increase of 7.8% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe FDA’s approval of Elrexfio is based on data from the pivotal phase II MagnetisMM-3 study, which evaluated elranatamab in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM who received Elrexfio as their first BCMA-directed therapy. A. The data from the study showed early and deep responses, and a manageable safety profile for elranatamab. In the study, the overall response rate was 58% in patients who received four or more lines of therapy. Out of these patients, 82% maintained the response for at least nine months. The median time to first response was 1.2 months. The approval also includes data from a cohort of the MagnetisMM-3 study in which the overall response rate was 33% among the 63 patients in this cohort who received four or more lines of therapy.However, Elrexfio’s label comes with a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity.The MagnetisMM program continues to study Elrexfio for expanded use in earlier lines of treatment, both as an individual agent as well as a combination therapy across the entire spectrum of myeloma progression, from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to RRMM. Elranatamab’s marketing authorization application is also under review in the EU.Story continuesPfizer has the largest number of new product and indication launches planned for 2023, most of which are expected to occur in the second half of the year. Pfizer is more than halfway to its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in 18 months' time (all non-COVID indications), which are expected to generate around $20 billion in sales by 2030. Two-thirds of these products have blockbuster potential, according to Pfizer.The FDA approved Abrysvo, Pfizer’s RSV vaccine for older adults, in May. Zavzpret (zavegepant nasal spray), Pfizer’s CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine was approved in March 2023.In June, the FDA approved Litfulo (ritlecitinib), its JAK3 inhibitor for treating severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents. The FDA also approved Ngenla, a long-acting once-weekly treatment for pediatric growth hormone deficiency in the same month.Pfizer believes some of its new product launches like Abrysvo RSV vaccine, etrasimod for ulcerative colitis (under review in United States and EU) and its pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (under review in Europe and the United States), coupled with business development activities, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen SGEN position Pfizer strongly for operational growth in 2025 and beyond.Pfizer offered to buy cancer drugmaker Seagen for $229 per share in cash or a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion in March.Seagen’s acquisition is expected to strengthen Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of antibody-drug conjugates. Seagen currently markets four cancer drugs — Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak. The Pfizer/Seagen transaction is expected to be closed in late 2023 or early 2024. The shareholders of Seagen have already approved the deal.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

164,96e5c473-8746-47df-9811-39c2fd3eb3e4,PYPL,2023-08-17,PayPal's new CEO faces these 3 big challenges,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypals-new-ceo-faces-these-3-big-challenges-203241343.html,1692217961,STORY,"['PYPL', 'AAPL', 'SQ']","[PayPal's (PYPL) new CEO and Dan Schulman's successor, Alex Chriss, is walking into a hornets' nest.The past few years haven't been easy for the payments giant.At the center of PayPal’s problems are weak margins — a problem that has followed the company for years, coming up quarter after quarter — and visible but underperforming products. For instance, Venmo, which is part of the company’s Braintree division, still has a long way to go in terms of monetizing its substantial user base.And just last year, PayPal was subject to a standoff with Elliott Management. Though the activist investor has since backed off — this week revealing that it had dissolved its stake in PayPal altogether — the damage has been done, and the concerns that Elliott raised, especially surrounding margins, still remain.So far this year, PayPal stock has declined more than 16% despite a broader tech rally.Here are the top three challenges that Chriss will face when he takes the helm at PayPal on Sept. 27.Good growth is hard to findThough PayPal has often succeeded in finding growth, it hasn't always been the growth that investors were hoping for.Take PayPal's second quarter, for example. The company saw 11% total payment volume growth, 7% revenue growth, and 8% growth within branded checkout. However, the gross profit numbers didn't follow, coming in at a mere 1% growth. The company also missed on its adjusted operating margin of 21.4%, given Wall Street's estimate of 22%.These concerns about PayPal's ability to grow while optimizing its margins have kept many analysts cautious at best.""We remain on the sidelines and await greater confidence in PayPal’s growth algorithm as we see concerns in the longer-term EPS growth profile,"" John Davis of Raymond James wrote on Aug. 2.Intuit executive Alex Chriss will become the president and CEO of digital payments company PayPal in September 2023. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Competition from Apple and Square has heated upPayPal has long benefited from being one of the first-ever fintechs, weaving together tech and financial services way before it was a well-trodden path.Story continuesHowever, products from Square's parent company Block (SQ) and Apple (AAPL) have been gaining ground at a rapid clip, a process of adoption that shows no signs of slowing. That competition has encroached on PayPal's lead in the space, including Venmo.A 2023 Deutsche Bank survey, based on responses from 1,708 consumers, showed that PayPal has retained its dominance, but its lead is fragile as adoption rates shoot up for Apple Pay and Block's Cash App.""While PYPL continues to be the dominant mobile payment service with 71% of respondents having used the service in the past 12 months, Cash App and Apple Pay both saw large increases in adoption over the past year reaching 46% and 31% adoption, respectively, up from 31% and 23%, respectively, last year,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane wrote in April.Big shoes to fillChriss — who was at Intuit for almost two decades — will be coming into PayPal as an outsider, and that will present challenges.""Coming from the outside, whatever your credentials or accomplishments, you are going to face fear-based skepticism,"" Peerage Capital founder and entrepreneur Miles Nadal said. ""No matter how urgent the need for change, people fear it. That’s further amplified by an outside appointment that sends the signal there is an appetite for change at the highest levels of the organization.""Furthermore, Chriss will be stepping in for Schulman, a notable figure in his own right. Even before PayPal, Schulman made his mark as the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile, a formative CEO of Priceline, and a key executive at American Express.President of PayPal Dan Schulman looks on at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 2023. (Stefani Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images) (STEFANI REYNOLDS via Getty Images)In some ways, this is almost the equivalent of a new CEO taking on the job of a tech CEO-founder, as Schulman has become indelibly associated with PayPal. Schulman stepped in at PayPal in 2014, as the company was separating from eBay (EBAY), and has been PayPal's CEO for the entirety of its tenure as a public company.But PayPal (and its shareholders and activists) have spoken, and it's time for PayPal to head in a new direction.Chriss's first task on Sept. 27 will be gaining trust — something that could be more complicated than filling Schulman's shoes or getting margins in order.""The first challenge is demonstrating the credibility, purpose, and the clear direction required to win internal and external stakeholder trust,"" said Nadal. ""That trust then translates into support.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Still, they left D.C. without the broad bipartisan vote Chair Pat McHenry had labored to achieve. The session ended with new recriminations over old disputes, namely the degree of federal vs. state regulation in a new regulatory framework, casting a dark cloud over the prospect of legislation that could garner support from McHenry, Ranking Member Maxine Waters, and the Biden White House.John Rizzo is Senior Vice President for Public Affairs at Clyde Group. Rizzo most recently served as the Senior Spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where he led public affairs strategy on digital assets, among other issues.And then PayPal and Paxos entered the chat. The surprise unveiling of PYUSD may be the accelerant needed to forge compromise in D.C. and bring about the legal enshrinement of a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. It may also represent a new, more aggressive strategy for how American fintech companies deal with the federal government and D.C. regulators.To understand why PYUSD’s launch is so monumental, one must recognize that it comes from one of the world’s largest digital payment companies, which boasts 430 million accounts. With the flip of a switch, hundreds of millions of users can access and transact in stablecoins through a service with which they are already familiar. It will speed up crypto adoption and make the ecosystem more challenging to bring to heel through Congressional action.The prospect of a significant market participant exploring a stablecoin project is a dynamic I observed up close while serving as a senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2021 and 2022. Those years saw the federal government attempting to implement a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins in the backdrop of Diem, Meta’s stablecoin project’s failure during the summer of 2021 (when it was announced, the project was known as Libra and Meta was called Facebook).Story continuesRead more: David Z. Morris - PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your DepositsHad it succeeded, Diem would have presented two challenges, which were discussed publicly at the time, for the federal government to wrestle with. Libra’s stablecoin would have launched when the U.S. lacked a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, meaning it would exist in a legal and regulatory gray space. And, while that reality would pose a challenge to the federal government, other stablecoin projects have and will exist in the same regulatory gray space. What was different about Diem was that its regulatory challenge would have been turbocharged by the fact that Facebook’s billions of users would have had access to this sort-of-regulated, sort-of-not-regulated crypto token overnight.PayPal is not Meta/Facebook, but the prospect of hundreds of millions of users soon having easy access to a stablecoin on a platform they already use and are comfortable with creates a new urgency for lawmakers in D.C. to reach a compromise on a regulatory framework for stablecoins. That didn’t exist when just a handful of Democrats voted in favor of Chair McHenry’s stablecoins bill.Before PYUSD’s unveiling, the stablecoin market was somewhat steady, consisting of the same players and similar levels of adoption. Hundreds of millions of PayPal users will soon have a crypto asset closer to their fingertips. Democratic policy makers in D.C. who resisted McHenry’s stablecoins bill in search of a better deal must account for the prospect that stablecoin adoption and usage could speed up rapidly soon, heightening some of the risks that D.C. policymakers identified when assessing stablecoin regulation.The legislative calculation isn’t the only equation that has changed for Democratic policymakers after the unveiling of PYUSD. The regulatory calculation has also changed, potentially ushering in a new era of how American crypto market participants engage with D.C.Read more: PayPal’s Regulated Stablecoin Is ‘Watershed Moment’ in CryptoAccording to reports, Libra’s stablecoins project backers extensively sought D.C. policymakers' approval before launching its token. On paper, it made sense. Unlike transportation policy, which Uber and Lyft showed can be changed by the force of will and mass adoption, financial services are highly regulated at the federal level. Forcing financial policy innovation without the pre-approval of regulators is daunting unless you operate in the one area of financial services primarily regulated by states.That’s PayPal’s ace in the hole. It’s the reason it could partner with Paxos Trust and change the pool of potential stablecoin users overnight. Its core business, money transmission, is regulated through a state-by-state licensing regime, meaning the federal government’s ability to impose a cost on PYUSD’s backers for launching a stablecoin without seeking prior approval is limited.The lobbying strategy for PYUSD may herald a somewhat new approach to D.C. by American crypto companies. Instead of asking permission, they’re demanding a seat at the table and bringing with them potentially hundreds of millions of users who will speed crypto adoption and make stablecoins a part of everyday economic life.Achieving a result in D.C. is not always about winning the competition of ideas. Instead, influencing policy is about power and leverageHaving observed power up close during 14 years of federal service between Congress and a presidential administration, achieving a result in D.C. is not always about winning the competition of ideas. Instead, influencing policy is about power and leverage. More often than not, those who have it get their way in D.C., and those who don’t, don’t.Supporters of stablecoins and market participants now have leverage over the federal government, including regulators and lawmakers, in a way that didn’t exist weeks ago. It could grease the wheels for a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins in Congress and begin an era in which American crypto companies force the federal government to deal with them on their terms.]"

Since then, carmakers and suppliers have announced more than $62 billion in investments in EVs, according to Bank of America research.New clean energy projects announced have resulted in more than 86,000 reshoring and foreign direct investment manufacturing jobs while jobs related to EVs grew by 27%, more than 17 times that of gasoline and diesel vehicle jobs, according to data compiled by Bank of America.""[There’s] something like a trillion-dollar shift from the federal government to the auto industry and the consumer,"" Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets lead global autos analyst, told Yahoo Finance. ""All of these OEMs are trying to jump on this and capture and we're seeing that momentum already take place.""Since the law’s passage, Hyundai has poured billions of dollars into two new gigafactories in Georgia to build electric vehicles. BMW has announced a $1 billion investment to retool its South Carolina facility for EV production, along with a $700 million investment to build an electric battery plant nearby. And earlier this year, Toyota upped its investment in its North Carolina battery plant to nearly $6 billion, making the Liberty facility the largest single economic development project commitment in the state’s history.""There’s a 10-year runway and frankly a lot of the hope is that we are subsidizing the learning by doing [it] early on, climbing the learning curve and sliding down the cost curve,"" Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, told Yahoo Finance. ""Then it’s a runaway train that, yes, runs on clean electricity.""EV tax creditsThe electric vehicle tax credit, which is aimed in large part at weaning US reliance on China, has been the primary driver supercharging these investments.Story continuesThe IRA requires that half of the value of battery components be produced or assembled in North America to be eligible for a $3,750 credit. For an additional $3,750 credit, 40% of the value of critical minerals must also be sourced from the US or a free trade partner.It explicitly bans carmakers from using battery components ""manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern,"" referring to non-allied countries including China, starting in 2024.The strict requirements and existing dependence on sourcing critical components from China have limited qualification to roughly a dozen EV models so far, including the Tesla Model 3 (TSLA) and Model Y. But the potential for a credit of up to $7500 per new vehicle has spurred carmakers to realign their supply chains for the long term.When the law was first signed, some electric vehicle makers, including startup Fisker (FSR), criticized the threshold to qualify for federal tax credits.Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker questioned the effectiveness of strict sourcing and manufacturing guidelines that explicitly favored North America, saying that they would ""slow down the adoption of EVs"" by limiting options for consumers.Yet, in his company’s first Product Vision Day earlier this month, Fisker went onstage, touting US manufacturing of his upcoming vehicles and the price reductions they would enjoy under IRA incentives.""They have to be built here in the US because we want to take advantage of the incentives,"" Fisker told Yahoo Finance, referring to the company’s electric pickup truck and SUVs. ""We are looking at a couple of options.""President Joe Biden drives a Cadillac Lyriq through the showroom during a tour at the Detroit Auto Show, Sept. 14, 2022. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Additional production credits in the IRA for battery cells and battery modules produced in the US have only sweetened the deal for producers, Narayan said.""A Chevy Equinox could be sold retail pre-credit for $30,000. You and I could get it for $20,000 at the same profitability,"" said Narayan, adding that American firms like General Motors (GM), which recently opened its Ultium battery factory in Ohio, have been the biggest beneficiaries. ""Everybody needs to build the cells locally in North America to qualify to get the $7,500 [EV credit] and the $35 [per kilowatt-hour battery] credit which completely more than offsets that capital expense of $2.6 billion per plant [for] GM.""Roughly half of all investment dollars stemming from the IRA have gone to EVs and batteries, resulting in an expanded annual battery production capacity of more than a million batteries, according to research from Bank of America.While analysts say the direct impact of tax credits on EV adoption is too early to measure, sales of zero-emission vehicles have continued to see an uptick. Nearly 300,000 new EVs were sold in the second quarter, setting a new record in the US, according to a report by Cox Automotive. That marked a 48.4% increase from the same period last year.""There's a lot of taxpayer money to help out with this,"" Morningstar US autos equity analyst David Whiston said. ""You're already seeing that when Tesla started with the initial 20% price cut on model Y and then they've kept going with that with further cuts.""""There are people that probably would have normally bought a combustion model this year [saying], 'You know what? I'm gonna go electric and get that model Y,'"" Whiston added. ""And the model Y is driving a huge chunk of the EV market gains in the US.""This post was edited by Grace O'Donnell.Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that GM has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.38, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 21.93. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.44. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 2.10.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.61. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 3.87.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help GM earn a Value grade of A, while FOXF has been given a Value grade of C.GM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

If you want to skip out on our introduction to the banking industry and the stock market, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks To Buy According To Wall Street Analysts. Banking has been one of the most heavily covered industries in the financial press this year. This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking cycle that has pushed U.S. interest rates to multi-decade highs. The rate set by the Fed is central to the banking industry's operations because banks are required to lend and borrow from each other at this rate. The higher this rate is, the costlier the borrowing becomes, and this is then transferred down to both consumers and businesses. For businesses, their short term borrowing revolves primarily around financing daily operations as they wait to collect payments and send money to suppliers before products generate revenue. For consumers, the high interest rates affect credit rates and other borrowing products.However, while the bank rate is primarily concerned with bank to bank borrowing and lending, a rapid interest rate hike has broader effects on the economy. Some of these also directly affect banks, particularly if the bond market is disrupted. Bonds that are issued with lower rates drop in value when the interest rate increases and banks often rely on bonds to maintain their capital and asset requirements as legally mandated. The turmoil in the bond market also thrust the banking industry into the limelight earlier this year as some banks that had relied on cheaper bonds discovered that their assets had dropped rapidly in value. For more details on the mini banking crisis in the U.S. in 2023, you should check out Top 20 Most Profitable Banks in the World.Moving into the second half of 2023, the banking industry is still quite dynamic. The March crisis spurred regulatory authorities into action, and new roles have been proposed to make sure that a similar crisis in the future does not affect the American economy. While the banks that failed in March were regional banks with smaller asset bases that did not put the economy at risk, other big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), can cause quite a lot of trouble if they were to face a similar environment. The rules are designed to ensure that the big banks are adequately capitalized to ensure that any turmoil does not spell into them being unable to meet their commitments. If you want to learn more about the different kinds of interest rates, and the results of a Federal Reserve stress test on the performance of big banks, we've covered it extensively as part of our 15 Worst Performing Bank Stocks in 2023 piece.Story continuesThe second half of 2023 has also been a crucial earnings season for all firms and banks in particular. Earnings results of big banks such as Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) show that there has been a bifurcation along the regional and diversified bank lines. The big banks have met or surpassed analyst EPS estimates while regional banks such as KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:TBNK), and Truist Financial Corporation (NYSE:TFC) have lagged the earnings estimates. Additionally, regional bank stocks have been among some of the worst performing this year, as most of the stocks in our list of 10 Oversold Bank Stocks To Buy are those of regional banks.August is shaping up to be another interesting month for the banking industry. Rating agency Fitch Ratings made history as August started after it downgraded U.S. government debt. As the rationale behind the move, the firm shared political uncertainty and difficulties in debt ceiling agreements in Congress as motivating factors but maintained that the U.S. has one of the strongest economies in the world. The firm was back in mid August as it warned that another downgrade to the U.S. banking sector might make it reevaluate ratings on the dozens of U.S. banks it covers, including industry heavy weights such as JPMorgan and Bank of America. The previous Fitch U.S. bank downgrade was in June, but it went relatively unnoticed. Fitch's latest assessment came after Moody's downgraded smaller U.S. banks in August and stressed that risks in the commercial real estate segment and a potential recession in the U.S. in 2024 can affect bank profitability and capital raising measures.So, during this turmoil, you might be wondering what bank stocks are undervalued according to Wall Street analysts. We've made a list of some such stocks today with the notable ones being First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB), and Popular, Inc.

Online sales rose 2.3% in the quarter.""Our customers and members are resilient,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the earnings call. ""They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories.""Meanwhile, its competitor Target (TGT), which reported Q2 results Wednesday, saw a 5.4% drop in sales and shared a dreary outlook for the rest of the year. This comes as consumers' wallets remain pinched from ongoing headwinds like higher gas prices, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments this fall, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, and higher costs for groceries.Sales at Walmart's wholesale business, Sam's Club US, also got a boost last quarter, rising 5.5%, but that was slightly lower than estimates of up 5.58%. The back-to-school and automotive categories performed well as consumers packed their bookshelves and backpacks ahead of the back-to-school season.""Typically, when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween and Christmas and GM in the back half,"" McMillon said. ""I do think our food and consumables percent to total in Walmart US will still go up.""In Q3, Walmart expects sales to increase by 3% and adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.50. Walmart also raised its full-year guidance. The retail giant expects sales to increase approximately 4% to 4.5% and lifted its earnings outlook to a range of $6.36-$6.46 from $6.10-$6.20 previously for the fiscal year.Story continuesWalmart stock fell by 2% on Thursday.The earnings rundown:Here's what Walmart reported compared with Wall Street estimates, according to Bloomberg data.Net revenue: $161.6 billion versus $159.7 billion expectedAdjusted diluted EPS: $1.84 versus $1.70 expectedUS same-store sales growth: 6.3% versus 4.04% expectedSam's Club US stores growth: 5.5% versus 5.58% expectedWalmart US same-store sales growth: 6.40% versus 4.29% expectedTraffic growth: 2.90% versus 1.63% expectedTicket growth: 3.40% versus 2.00% expectedE-commerce growth: 2.30% versus 1.54% expectedGross margin: 23.38% versus 23.55% expectedInventory growth: -5.34% versus -5.54% expectedWalmart by the numbers (Credit: Yahoo Finance, Source: Walmart)What stood out to us:Walmart US gaining market share across categoriesE-commerce is a booming business for the retail giant.In Q2, overall e-commerce net sales increased by 24%, led by pickup and delivery. Online sales now make up 15% of total sales, reaching $24 billion globally.In the US, Walmart continues to gain market share, gaining high single-digit sales growth as grocery shoppers bought more food as well as pet and personal care products.The company also noted that it saw growth in private label brands, which were up 40 basis points, a business it's been bulking up in recent years.""We've seen customers that are trading down from chicken and pork straight into chicken and ground beef, from things like shrimp and steaks,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance. He added customers ""are also trading into private label, and that's about 20% of our business for Walmart US. And frankly, the quality of those items is much better than it was several years ago.""A customer shops for a turkey at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018.

The company cited strong pharmacy sales reflected in script counts, a higher mix of branded versus generic prescriptions, strength in immunizations, and branded drug inflation.Since 2019, the retail giant has built up Walmart Health, aimed at making healthcare more accessible using the retailer's existing US footprint of 4,684 locations.Walmart's other side hustle, the company's media business Walmart Connect, saw a 36% spike in advertising compared to last year.The business could represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company, Drbul wrote in a note to clients, given ""Walmart’s vision, reach, and ambition.""As of June, some of its partners include NBCUniversal, Roku, TikTok, and TalkShopLive. Its growth strategy allows the retail giant to understand consumers' behaviors and refine ad targets as the company focuses on e-commerce sales, which are expected to have increased by 1.5% last quarter.And as the ad market roars back, Walmart Connect and its peers are proving to be pretty immune to macroeconomic headwinds.""Now is the time to be advertising to stay top of mind with consumers and make sure that your brand message comes across loud and clear,"" Ryan Mayward, a senior vice president of sales at Walmart Connect, told Yahoo Finance ahead of the company's annual meeting in May.What else we're watching: C-suite changeupOn Wednesday, Walmart announced Sam's Club CEO and president Kathryn McLay is moving into a new role as head of the international division, replacing Judith McKenna who is retiring, effective Sept. 11, 2023.As part of this change, Walmart US CEO John Furner outlined further executive changes in a letter to all Walmart employees obtained by Yahoo Finance.Chris Nicholas, who previously served as COO and as CFO before that, was promoted to Sam’s Club US CEO and president. Kieran Shanahan, an exec in the International Operations division, was named executive vice president and COO for Walmart US.What analysts were saying after earnings: ""We remain encouraged for growth within WMT's margin accretive initiatives which include +35% growth in advertising, marketplace, and WMT+ memberships which we estimate between 22-24 [million] members. Inventory management remains a strength as levels fell (5.6%) relative to total sales growth +5.9%."" -Oliver Chen, TD Cowen""It was another solid quarter, causing WMT to raise its full-year guidance once again. With investors starting to look toward next fiscal year, we see plenty of levers for WMT to continue its strong momentum and grow margins. 1P e-commerce profitability seems to be at an inflection point. In addition, higher-margin businesses like advertising and 3P marketplace are growing faster than the core."" -Arun Sundaram, CFRA""We expect the stock to trade higher today given the 2Q beat and raised FY23 guidance. ... Expect some questions to emerge on TGT’s discretionary trends given WMT’s general merchandise improvement in 2Q."" -Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)This article was originally published in the second issue of FreightWaves’ Supply Chain Playbook.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed an already fragile global supply chain, companies have invested billions of dollars in technology, including digitization and artificial intelligence, in an attempt to speed up the flow of data to tackle ongoing forecast demand challenges.Businesses are prioritizing the speed of data propagation within their supply chains. This includes sourcing materials, working with vendors, managing warehouses and transportation, and coordinating with retailers to ensure they can meet the changing demands of consumers while remaining profitable.However, based on first-quarter earnings calls, many companies, including manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies, missed the mark on their forecasts as they struggled to become more agile in adjusting their resources to align with evolving consumer and economic trends.Economy and inflation challengesRetailers that used to base their forecasts on previous years’ sales are now being more cautious, as the surge in e-commerce their companies experienced during the pandemic continues to decline.“Between the pandemic and now with the ongoing challenges that we’re facing with the economy and inflation, I think many retailers are trying to find an ordering balance,” Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, told FreightWaves.According to Gold, NRF members have made significant investments in data analysis to improve their ability to predict consumer demand to prevent bloated inventory levels that many large retailers experienced around this time in 2022.Retailers that used to base their forecasts on previous years’ sales are now being more cautious, as the surge in e-commerce their companies experienced during the pandemic continues to decline. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Big-box retailers like Best Buy, Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. seemingly ignored inventory data that the pandemic-driven buying spree that lasted from March 2020 until the end of 2021 was waning, leading to bloated inventories, according to an article written by FreightWaves’ Mark Solomon. Instead of consumers purchasing big-ticket items like electronics, consumers shifted their focus to buying less profitable items like groceries, he wrote.Story continuesAdam Josephson, a market expert for FreightWaves, said that retailers like Walmart and Target misread demand for high-ticket discretionary items such as furniture, apparel and appliances last year.“They assumed that the COVID levels of demand would sustain themselves and they didn’t and Target and Walmart, along with companies like Home Depot and others, spent months and months trying to get those inventories down. In some cases, they’re still struggling to do so,” Josephson said. “These companies got caught with their pants down and now are trying to react accordingly.”Shifting pandemic policies affect businesses, consumersWhile numerous retailers expected employers to continue to allow employees to work remotely post-pandemic as some studies suggested, many companies chose to implement some type of hybrid model, which requires some in-person time in the office.Gartner, a management consulting firm, estimates that fully remote and hybrid employees will account for 71% of U.S. workers in 2023. The company’s survey of Fortune 100 companies showed that 77% have implemented hybrid work schedules.“Obviously, the return to work [policies] certainly had an impact on many businesses,” Gold said. “Retailers prepared for folks to work from home and stock up on things like athleisure wear, but consumers are now buying more business-casual attire as they head back into the office.”Companies are using data tools like FreightWaves SONAR, which provides ocean data that can be used to predict what domestic trucking volumes may look like over the next six weeks, to help forecast demand. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Finding a balance to adapt to current economic conditions is challenging as many seasonal orders are placed six to nine months in advance, according to Gold.“Forecasting was challenging prior to the pandemic but with the economic uncertainty it’s become even more challenging going forward,” Gold said.“I don’t think you can look back on the past three years and make any real determinations just based on numbers. I think it’s important to get a better understanding of what’s happening going forward,” he said. “During the pandemic, when you saw the initial spike in e-commerce when everything was locked down, people were home, and now that’s tailed off back to where it was traditionally.”Demand visibilityReliance on historical data to develop forecasts is unpredictable based on consumers’ ordering patterns during the pandemic, as well as in 2019, when the global economy reported its lowest growth in a decade, dropping to 2.3%, according to the lengthy report released by the United Nations in January 2020.Previously, companies would survey their customers about their demand forecasts based on the previous years’ sales or look at historical demand patterns to develop their forecasts. However, even with better data, some companies are finding it hard to interpret and quickly pivot to consumer demand.However, companies are using data tools like FreightWaves SONAR, which provides ocean data that can be used to predict what domestic trucking volumes may look like over the next six weeks, to help forecast demand.While the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global supply chain, adding data tools to traditional forecasting models is key.“What folks came to realize throughout the pandemic is how forecasting and data are all linked together,” Gold said. “It’s all integrated — everybody in the supply chain relies on each other — from what the retailer is forecasting and expecting, which has an impact on the ocean side, the truck side, the warehouse side. And if you get a hiccup anywhere along the line, it impacts everybody else.”Companies must be nimble when there are significant demand drops or increases throughout the supply chain, he said.“What folks are trying to prepare for and understand is where that demand is and make sure they’ve got the right resources available with every step along the way,” Gold said. “And that was one of the challenges that we had during the pandemic — the resources didn’t match what that demand was. Because demand happens so quickly, that folks on the ocean shipping side couldn’t respond in time.”Diversifying sourcing strategiesWhen the Chinese government shut down the entire Wuhan province in late January 2020 because of COVID, it sparked panic among manufacturers and retailers that relied solely on China to produce their goods and services. Some are turning to Vietnam and India to help prevent another backlog of freight hindering ocean carriers from delivering goods to the U.S. and other countries.While companies have been exploring nearshoring options, which may take years to develop, Gold said the key to building a resilient supply chain is to have diversified sourcing strategies in place going forward.“Businesses around the globe are looking for new sourcing opportunities — and diversification — not just relying on China as a sole source but having China plus another source,” he said. “This means you have to work closely with all of your supply chain partners, your ocean partners and your trucking partners from the outset so that if a disruption occurs, companies throughout the supply chain can react immediately and have a plan in place to be able to mitigate the impact of whatever issues arise.”The post Data key to tackling forecasting challenges  appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:There continues to be modest pressure on estimates for Q3 and beyond, but a big part of that is coming from the Energy sector. Outside of the Energy sector, estimates are very stable and are actually increasing for some key sectors.For the 463 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -9.2% from the same period last year on +0.6% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.We see the above-average Q2 EPS beats percentage as reflective of a favorable turn in underlying earnings trends, particularly since Q2 estimates hadn’t fallen as much as we have seen in other recent quarters.For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.3% on +0.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.2% on +3.1% higher revenues.The weak sales numbers from Target TGT – the retailer missed consensus estimates for the top-line and same-store sales – are most likely a function of company-specific execution and merchandising issues, not reflective of moderation in consumer spending.Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Story continuesTarget’s Q2 margins were better, and management indicated satisfaction with inventory levels. But investors can’t be faulted for being skeptical of such views, as continuation of Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends in the current and coming quarters will mean the inventory overhang coming back all over again.Unlike Walmart WMT, which hasn’t reported results yet but has a much bigger groceries business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise. At the same time, consumer spending on discretionary items of the type that Target specializes in has undoubtedly moderated as demand shifted towards leisure, travel, and related activities. But Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.Consumer spending will eventually slow down in response to Fed tightening. However, we didn’t see much evidence of that in the Q1 earnings reports, neither from Walmart and Target nor from other consumer-centric companies.These big-box retail leaders missed due to weak execution and failure to have the right merchandise in stores. Consumers didn’t buy the patio furniture at Walmart or appliances at Target, but they did plenty of shopping at Home Depot HD.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from almost 93% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.The blended growth for the quarter is on track for an earnings decline of -8.0% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -3.4% decline in index earnings in the preceding period (2023 Q1) and the -5.4% decline in the last quarter of 2022.In other words, 2023 Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.3%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.The long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either.These growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.John HulbertGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their insights on our second quarter performance, along with our outlook and priorities for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the second quarter and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian?Story continuesBrian C. CornellThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our team and our business model showed remarkable resilience in the face of multiple headwinds in the external environment. While these headwinds have led to a temporary slowdown in the pace of our business, that doesn't mean our team is standing still. Throughout the company, our team remains focused on staying agile and flexible as we continue to serve our guests and to listen carefully to them in this very dynamic environment. And we're fortunate to have a business model that's inherently flexible by design. We offer a balanced multi-category assortment that's focused on our guests' wants and needs, allowing us to stay relevant in any environment and to quickly pivot as our guest priorities change. And our unique stores as hubs model, a concept we pioneered in the retail industry, allows us to serve our guests quickly, flexibly and reliably on every shopping journey, whether it takes place in a store or on a digital device. By continuously listening to, learning from and engaging with our guests and then refining our playbook with their insights, we'll continue to achieve our purpose of delivering everyday joy for all the families we serve while reinforcing our strong culture of caring, growing and winning together. As you'll recall, in the first half of 2022, we were faced with excess inventory, driven by a rapid change in consumer spending patterns. In the face of that challenge, the team took important steps a year ago, allowing us to quickly adjust our inventory down to the proper level. Those critical decisions have allowed our team to operate efficiently while focusing on serving our guests. They've enabled the presentation of fresh, seasonally appropriate assortments throughout the year and provided the flexibility to lean into share opportunities in key seasons, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. And importantly, last year's inventory actions laid the groundwork for the recovery in profitability we've achieved so far this year. Our team also played a critical role in our second quarter profit performance. As we began to see softening sales trends early in the quarter, the team in our stores and supply chain responded with speed and agility. Their discipline, along with ongoing efficiency efforts, allowed our profit performance to exceed our original expectations despite a meaningful shortfall on the top line. More specifically, for the quarter just ended, operating income expanded by more than $800 million compared with a year ago. And despite the fact we've experienced more than a percentage point of cumulative profit pressure from higher shrink since 2019, our EPS of $3.86 through the first half of the year is more than 50% higher than in 2019. While this is encouraging progress, we are confident we'll see further meaningful increases in our profitability over time. On the top line, Q2 results were below our expectations as comparable sales decreased 5.4%. Within the quarter, comp trends softened from the second half of May into June, before we saw a meaningful recovery in both traffic and comps in July. In the month, we were especially pleased with trends around Independence Day holiday, along with Circle Week, which also resulted in the addition of more than 0.5 million new Target Circle members. Consistent with recent industry trends, second quarter comps reflected continued growth in our frequency categories, offset by notable software results in our more discretionary categories. Across channels, sales were strongest in our stores, while results in our digital channel were led by continued growth in our Drive-Up service. Consistent with our stores as hubs strategy, more than 97% of our second quarter sales were fulfilled by our stores. As we've described for more than a year now, the divergence of sales trends between our frequency and discretionary categories is being driven by multiple cross currents that are affecting the U.S. consumer. These include the impact of inflation in frequency categories, like Food &amp; Beverage and Essentials, causing these categories to absorb a much-higher portion of consumers' budgets. In addition, consumers are choosing to increase spending on services, like leisure travel, entertainment and food away from home, putting near-term pressure on discretionary products. And finally, the rollback of government efforts to support consumers during the pandemic, including stimulus payments, enhanced child care tax credits and the suspension of student loan payments, presents an ongoing headwind that consumers continue to manage. Beyond these factors in the second quarter, many of our store team members faced a negative guest reaction to our Pride assortment. As you know, we have featured a Pride assortment for more than a decade. However, after the launch of the assortment this year, members of our team began experiencing threats and aggressive actions that affected their sense of safety and well being while at work. I want to make it clear: We denounce violence and hate of all kinds, and the safety our team and our guests is our top priority. So to protect the team in the face of these threatening circumstances, we quickly made changes, including the removal of items that were at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior. Pride is one of many heritage moments that are important to our guests and our team, and we'll continue to support these moments in the future. They are just one part of our commitment to support a diverse team, which helps us serve a diverse set of guests. And as we talk to these guests, they consistently tell us that Target is their happy place, somewhere they can go to escape and recharge. So as we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're committed to staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target. Specific to Pride and Heritage months, we're focused on building assortments that are celebratory and joyous with wide-ranging relevance, being mindful of timing, placement and presentation, leaning into segmentation and leveraging our digital experience and reconsidering the mix of owned brands, national brands and external partners within these assortments. Our goal is to ensure we continue to celebrate moments that are special to our guests while acknowledging that, every day, for millions of people, they want Target to serve as a refuge in their daily lives. In addition to these more recent challenges, our team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime. As you'll hear in more detail from Michael, shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations, but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time. And unfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction. During the first 5 months of this year, our stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence. As a result, we're continuing to work tirelessly with retail industry groups and community partners to find solutions to promote safety for our store teams and our guests. Looking ahead, as you'll hear from both Christina and John, our team is focused on moving forward and preparing for the biggest seasons of the year. And given the current consumer and economic backdrop, we've adjusted our guidance for the remainder of the year, consistent with a cautious planning approach that has served us so well during the first half of the year. Against this cautious backdrop, our team is laser-focused on delivering newness, quality and affordability, reinforced by a commitment to retail fundamentals. Given the rapid growth and the volatility our business has experienced over the last several years, we have an opportunity to refocus our team on 4 key factors that determine where consumers choose to shop: Being reliably in stock; highlighting affordability throughout our assortment, presentation and marketing; leveraging the proximity of our stores to the guests we serve; while ensuring a seamless differentiated, easy and inspiring guest experience on every trip, every day. These areas have always been a source of strength, and we want to ensure we continue to differentiate our experience from our competitors. Within our merchandising, we'll continue to invest in our industry-leading owned brand portfolio, along with the expansion of key national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Levis, Apple and Disney. We'll focus on deepening the relationship with over 100 million Target Circle members and leveraging the power of our Roundel ad business to integrate relevant offers and promotions throughout the fall. And we'll continue to drive awareness of our industry-leading Drive-Up service and highlight the recent addition of new guest-focused options, including Drive-Up returns and the ability to have a Starbuck beverage delivered with your order. Of course, we'll also continue to invest in our physical assets to position us for continued future growth. But the bulk of these investments are happening in our stores as we add new locations, complete full store remodels, enhance the efficiency of our same-day services and add new locations for our Ulta Beauty partnership, Disney store concept or enhanced Apple experience. In the supply chain, we're continuing to invest in upstream replenishment capabilities, along with the expansion of our network of sortation centers, which deliver meaningful savings while increasing the speed of our last-mile delivery. So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take stock of where our business is today. And I think it's helpful to pull back the lens because 2023 is the fourth year in a row in which the external backdrop has been far different from anything we've ever experienced. Yet today, as a result of our team's consistent efforts to listen, understand and serve our guests, Target is a much different company than it was 4 years ago. We have the right strategy, guest relevance and team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Through the first half of 2023, our total revenue of just over $50 billion was about 39% higher than the $36 billion we delivered in 2019. This growth reflects significant increases across our entire business in all 5 merchandising categories in both our stores and digital channels and in our Roundel ad business. And this growth reflects an increase in guest engagement, as measured by the number of visits they're making to Target. And today, despite the challenges we faced in recent quarters, the number of guest trips through the first half of 2023 was more than 169 million higher or more than 21% higher than in 2019. Our team delivered this growth during a time of exceptional uncertainty and volatility. I want to end my remarks by acknowledging that accomplishment. And I also want to recognize the team members in our stores and distribution centers for the way they quickly responded to the recent and unexpected slowdown in our top line sales trends. It's because of their discipline and agility that we've continued to provide an outstanding shopping experience while delivering better-than-expected profitability so far this year. On behalf of all our stakeholders, I want to thank our entire team for their continued extraordinary efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Christina.A. Christina HenningtonThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the multiple headwinds we were faced on the top line, there were a number of things to like in the second quarter. Of the many notable bright spots, our team's agile execution in service of our guests and each other rises to the top. Consumers continue to face difficult choices with every purchase. Whether managing their budgets in the face of higher prices or planning for resuming student loan payments, our guests are facing multiple ongoing challenges. With inflation rates moderating, however, we've started to see consumer confidence begin to recover from recent lows. And while we're maintaining an appropriately cautious outlook today, we're hopeful that conditions can improve with time. In the meantime, even as consumers continue to spend with caution, our guests continue to embrace newness and seasonally relevant moments, all with an unwavering focus on affordability. In the second quarter, comparable sales were down 5.4%, softer than our expectations coming into the quarter. Frequency categories continue to grow, partially offsetting the softness we saw in discretionary categories. Essentials &amp; Beauty grew in the mid-single digits, led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the low double digits. Within our Beauty offering, core Beauty delivered double-digit growth while sales from Ulta Beauty at Target more than doubled compared with a year ago, showing why we're so enthusiastic about this exclusive partnership. Food &amp; Beverage sales were in the low single digits, and we saw particular strength in snacks, candy and beverages. Conversely, discretionary categories softened further from recent trends, with Apparel, Home and Hardlines all seeing comp declines in the low double digits to mid-teens in the second quarter, several percentage points softer than in the first quarter. Even as trends in these categories remain quite soft overall, there are pockets of newness that are working quite well, and we're doubling down on investments in those areas. For example, our Entertainment business within Hardlines continues to see healthy growth in the mid-single digits, driven by newness in books and renewed growth in vinyl records. With that in mind and knowing how our guests can't get enough of Taylor Swift, we proactively secured an exclusive vinyl offering that Swifties bought in droves. Additionally, in Home, we've seen incredible demand for Stanley tumblers and cups. So we worked in partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines to add exclusive new colors to the line as part of our beloved owned brand, Hearth &amp; Hand, found only at Target. As you heard from Brian, we anticipated some of the headwinds at play throughout the second quarter. including the continued pullback in discretionary spending. Other headwinds were incremental, including the strong reaction to this year's Pride assortment. Our goal is for our assortment to resonate broadly and deliver on the Target brand promise. In this case, the reaction is a signal for us to pause, adapt and learn so that our future approach to these moments balances celebration, inclusivity and broad-based appeal. As we move ahead, we're confident that if we stay close to our guests, consistently execute on our retail fundamentals and continue investing in our assortments, services and experiences, we will position Target for continued growth over the long term. After all, as a guest-led company, we have been listening to and learning from our guests for decades. As an example, last year, we heard loud and clear that Target Circle members love exclusive events. So we repurposed last year's Deal Days and made our Target Circle Week in July bigger than ever with incremental promotions and new ways to engage. In fact, we enrolled well over 0.5 million new guests during this event alone, more than 3.5x higher than in an average week. Additionally, Beauty guests told us for years how they would love the convenience of completing their beauty trip with access to prestige beauty products while shopping at Target. This led to the development of a unique partnership with Ulta Beauty to meet those needs. And today, based on the strong results we've seen so far, we continue to expand the footprint of these new shop-in-shops. When our guests, who already love our Drive-Up service, told us that they wanted us to add Starbucks and the ability to make returns, we quickly built, piloted and are now rolling out those capabilities across the chain, and we're seeing incredibly high Net Promoter Scores from our guests. And well before the recent release of the long-awaited Barbie Movie, we collaborated with our vendor partners to secure exclusive items across multiple categories while adding a splash of pink style for Barbie fans of all ages. Barbie, along with Disney's The Little Mermaid, are the most recent examples of our long record of success in securing timely, relevant product lines supporting key movie licenses across toys, apparel, home, beauty and food, which have allowed us to consistently capture between 30% and 60% market share with these properties. While we continue to take a conservative inventory position overall, these examples show that we are still leaning into key opportunities. We know our guests want to celebrate culturally and seasonally relevant moments, and we'll be leaning into those moments in a big way in the third quarter and the upcoming holiday season. And our guests have told us that affordability; availability; and easy, convenient and consistently joyful shopping experience are more important than ever. While I've shared in prior calls that we're always focused on retail fundamentals, we're further sharpening our focus on 4 key aspects: Comprehensive affordability, in-stock levels, leveraging our proximity to our guests and the overall shopping experience. For a great example look no further than our Back-to-School and Back-to-College assortments. We know our guests are approaching Back-to-School with a value-conscious, deal-driven mindset, so we're leaning into savings for teachers and college students, including our 20% off Teachers Appreciation and Student Savings events. We're also featuring ultra low everyday prices all season long, with school supplies starting as low as $0.25, and key items such as lunch boxes and graphic tees at compelling $5 price points. And just in time for Back-to-School, we're launching new Good &amp; Gather products, including an assortment of new lunchbox-sized items. Back-to-College is always a big season for Target. This year, we're leaning into affordability as well as proximity to college-bound students. This includes strategic inventory bets and allocations in key markets where there are the greatest market share opportunities to ensure we're in stock and ready to play offense during this critical season. Of course, affordability goes well beyond a single season like Back-to-School. In fact, with many consumers making their decisions on where to shop based on affordability, we're highlighting the comprehensive value we provide through our $30-plus billion owned brand portfolio. For example, Threshold, our flagship owned brand in Home, just received a major facelift. With new branding, stronger price points and a clarified aesthetic to help guests mix and match affordable styles for their homes, this beloved brand will be even easier to love. And just in time for the holidays, we'll be launching new owned brands while expanding others, including the launch of a new kitchenware line that will make everyday meal prep easier while offering incredible quality and durability. Look for lots of newness on store shelves and online later this Fall. As John will cover in more detail, we continue to invest heavily in our in-store experience, which starts with new stores and remodels that incorporate our latest and greatest offerings, including Apple, Levi's and Disney experiences, as well as the additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. And just like we remodel our stores to reflect our latest thinking and guest feedback into the shopping experience, we'll begin rolling out a remodel of our digital experience this quarter. Based on guest feedback, we're investing to create a digital experience that enhances the love of discovery while balancing the ease of navigation. This will include different landing experiences, more personalized content, enhanced search functionality, ease of navigation and other updates to bring more joy and convenience to our digital guests. Through it all, our teams continue to exhibit a commitment to excellence in the pursuit of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. Regardless of the external environment, our team consistently shows up and rises to the moment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside such a talented team. Thank you for all you do to bring that Target magic to life day in and day out. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John J. MulliganThanks, Christina. Like Brian and Christina, I want to start by thanking our amazing team. This quarter's better-than-expected profitability was a testament to their agility and resilience as they successfully managed through multiple challenges. And while the team deserves credit for this performance, they got an assist from this year's leaner inventory position which offered more room to maneuver than a year ago when the team was dealing with excess inventory. This year, with unclouded facilities, a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and our continued work to enhance efficiency, the team delivered an impressive increase in profitability in the face of a challenging top line. Across the entire supply chain, we're benefiting from much more favorable conditions than a year ago. Perhaps most notable is in global shipping, where second quarter import lead times were nearly 30 days shorter than last year and within a couple of days of pre-pandemic levels. In our domestic supply chain, because of strong partnership with our vendors, we're seeing improvement on multiple performance metrics, including fill rates and on-time arrivals. And at our regional distribution centers, inbound backlogs have been reduced by more than a day since last year.In the new flow centers we've opened over the last couple of years, we're also seeing improvements across multiple performance metrics as these new buildings continue to scale up towards capacity. In support of their primary role in replenishing store inventory, these facilities were designed and equipped to support our stores as hubs strategy with newly developed automation that can assemble customized, presorted and sequence shipments for every store they serve. With these shipments, stores see faster replenishment times, require less labor to unload a trailer and maintain lower levels of backroom inventory. More precisely, stores being serviced by these new facilities have seen a 20% reduction in lead times, enabling them to respond more quickly to changes in guest demand. Also notable, stores serviced by these new facilities are benefiting from improvements in in-stock levels while maintaining lower levels of backroom inventory.Beyond store replenishment, we're operating these new flow centers in a way that's unique within the industry. In the same way we pioneered ways to leverage the proximity, inventory and assets in our stores to quickly and efficiently fulfill digital orders, we're leveraging those same characteristics of our flow centers to fulfill certain digital orders beyond their primary role in replenishing store inventories.In light of our focus on retail fundamentals throughout the supply chain, our stores are seeing meaningful improvements in their in-stocks, even with 17% lower inventory on our balance sheet than a year ago. In the second quarter, overall in-stocks were a full percentage point better than first quarter and more than 2 points better than last year. We've seen even bigger improvements on our top items and in our top stores. And this year, we sat with meaningfully better in-stocks on key seasonal programs, including Back-to-School and Back-to-College, than we saw a year ago.Our new sortation centers are delivering outstanding results. These facilities operate downstream from our stores and help to increase the speed and efficiency of last-mile delivery. Up to 70% of the packages processed by these facilities stay in the local market, allowing us to partner with Shipt to handle the last mile. This integration with Shipt allows us to achieve meaningful efficiency and cost savings while offering much greater speed of delivery to our guests.More specifically, in markets where we operate a sortation center, the average click-to-deliver time is nearly 1.5 days shorter than the network average, with about 1/3 of the packages arriving in only 1 day. As we continue to open new buildings and test and iterate on their operating model, we expect these speed metrics will continue to improve in the future.Today, based on the proven success of this strategy, we have 10 sortation centers already operating and expect to open at least 6 more over the next few years. This current group of sortation centers is expected to process more than 35 million packages in 2023, representing a more than 20% increase from a year ago and a more than sixfold increase from 2021. As I described in our call 3 months ago, store teams this year have been focused on reinforcing best practices that support the retail fundamentals Christina highlighted earlier. In particular, this year, we've been investing to provide incremental training and reporting on several key factors that play a critical role in providing a great shopping experience, including staffing and scheduling; setting, filling and replenishing merchandise presentations; and protecting the safety of our guests and our team. Throughout this year, our store teams have been progressing through a strategically sequenced training program designed to reinforce these best practices at key moments, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. The goal is to provide an elevated, consistent experience every day in every store across the country. Since we've rolled out this training, we've seen broad-based improvement on performance metrics tied to critical guest outcomes, including pricing accuracy, locating items for digital orders and setting key seasonal programs more quickly and completely. And in support of the goal of achieving greater consistency in the level of execution across our nearly 2,000 stores, we've implemented a new rapid response process to help individual locations recover more quickly when they begin to see a decline in key metrics. Also in stores, as Christina mentioned, we are really pleased with the early results from nationwide rollout of Drive-Up returns and the ability to add a Starbucks order to a Drive-Up trip. We've long said that Drive-Up receives the highest satisfaction rating of any service we provide. And as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we continually push ourselves to find new ways to further differentiate Drive-Up. And when we ask our guests how we could do that, they told us that adding Starbucks and taking returns were at the top of their list.To ensure that we could consistently execute on these new services while maintaining the high bar we've attained for satisfaction, we applied a disciplined test-and-iterate approach to the rollout, beginning with small-scale tests in the second half of 2022. Following a successful test of Drive-Up returns, we launched the service nationwide in April and May, and the results have been outstanding. Once a guest arrives at a Drive-Up lane, the average wait time for a team member to process their return is within 3 minutes, consistent with our standards for a traditional Drive-Up order. As we began testing the addition of Starbucks to Drive-Up, and given the complexities of making and promptly delivering a hot or cold beverage after our guest arrives, we wanted to put the process through an intensive period of testing and refinement. And today, based on what we've learned during the test period, we're confident we can scale up this service while consistently maintaining our service standards. As a result, we're currently in the process of rolling out Starbucks at Drive-Up nationwide and plan to complete the rollout by the end of October, just in time for pumpkin spice latte season.So now before I finish my remarks, I want to provide a brief update on this year's new store openings. As you know, we plan to open about 20 new locations this year, ranging in size from 20,000 to 137,000 square feet. In the second quarter, we completed and opened another 5 new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 11.Highlight of our second quarter projects was the opening of our first new offshore location since 2021, a new store in the Oahu Windward Mall, bringing our store count in Hawaii up to 9. At 132,000 square feet and featuring a Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, CVS, Snack Bar and 18 Drive-Up stalls, this is one of the largest stores we'll open in 2023. And I'm happy to say that it had one of the strongest openings of the year, reflecting outstanding execution by our team. Like our other stores in Hawaii, this new location is expected to be one of the most productive in the chain. And during its first week, it generated the second-highest sales volume out of the most recent 175 stores we've opened.I also want to pause and acknowledge the devastating wildfires that hit Maui in Hawaii. Thankfully, members of our team there are safe, though some have lost homes, had to evacuate or are providing shelter for family and friends. Our nearby stores remain open, helping guests to get much-needed essentials while donating masks and other emergency supplies. In addition, Target has announced a $1 million donation to help national and local disaster partners, and our team member giving fund is collecting donations from team members across the country to help their colleagues impacted by these wildfires.So as I turn the call over to Michael, I want to end with where I started and highlight the tireless efforts of the best team in retail. The last 4 years have been anything but business as usual, and through it all, our team has consistently maintained their focus on what matters most: Taking care of our guests and taking care of each other. I couldn't be more proud to work alongside them and learn from them every day.That, I'll turn it over to Michael.Michael J. FiddelkeThanks, John. As John just mentioned, our team and operating model continue to navigate through a host of challenges on the top line, but our business is showing its resilience. More specifically, we're really pleased with the strength of our second quarter profit performance, which further validates the cautious planning approach and lean inventory position we've maintained throughout the year. This positioning, combined with our continued efficiency efforts, allowed us to make meaningful progress toward our profit recovery goals even in the face of softer-than-expected sales, giving us further confidence that our strategy is sound, we have the right team and our business is positioned for continued progress in the years ahead.Total revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter. Total sales also decreased by that same amount while other revenue grew 1.3%. Within other revenue, we continue to see strong growth from our Roundel ad business, which offset declines in credit card profit sharing and other small income items compared with last year. Comparable sales were down 5.4% in Q2, reflecting a 4.8% decline in traffic. Among the factors affecting our top line performance, comps and discretionary categories continue to reflect challenging trends in the industry, which softened further in Q2. A second factor was lower inflation in food, beverages and essentials as we compare to over peak inflation a year ago. Furthermore, traffic and top line trends were affected by the reaction to our Pride assortment, which launched in the middle of May. And lastly, our results reflected the comparison over last year's clearance and promotional activity, which affected weekly comp trends in certain categories, particularly in the digital channel. While each of these factors played a role in the quarter, it's not possible to reliably quantify the separate impact of each one.In terms of the monthly cadence in Q2, comp sales in May were down a little more than 3%, moved down to a decline of just over 7% in June, then made an encouraging recovery to minus 5% in July. Monthly traffic followed a similar cadence and actually recovered a bit faster than sales in July. Even with unexpectedly soft sales, inventories remain very well controlled. At the end of the second quarter, balance sheet inventory was 17% lower than a year ago. This reflects our cautious planning approach, the agility of our team in responding to softer sales trends and the benefit of a faster global supply chain which enabled shorter lead times. Among our merchandising categories, discretionary inventory was down 25% at the end of Q2, partially offset by increases in our frequency categories and strategic investments and long-term share opportunities. Importantly, as John mentioned, even with much leaner inventories, we've seen meaningful in-stock improvements across our network. We were really pleased with our second quarter gross margin performance, which was enabled by our ongoing work to navigate this volatile environment. Our Q2 gross margin rate of 27% was 5.5 percentage points higher than a year ago. This increase reflects multiple benefits within merchandising, including lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, along with the benefit of lower freight and transportation costs.Beyond merchandising, we also saw about 0.5 point of benefit in digital fulfillment and supply chain due to a lower mix of digital sales and a favorable mix of same-day services within the digital channel. Offsetting these benefits was a 90 basis point headwind from inventory shrink, in line with our expectations.One note. Consistent with the first quarter, category mix did not affect our gross margin rate compared with last year, and we saw a similar deceleration across all 5 of our core merchandising categories between Q1 and Q2 of this year.Our second quarter SG&amp;A expense rate was 1.7 percentage points higher than last year. This increase reflects the deleveraging impact of lower sales, combined with the impact of higher costs, including continued investments in paying benefits for our team and inflationary pressures throughout our business. These pressures were partially offset by disciplined cost management across our team.On the D&amp;A expense line. The Q2 rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales on a 3.9% increase in dollars. Altogether, our Q2 operating margin rate of 4.8% was about 4x higher than last year, reflecting a meaningful recovery from last year's inventory actions. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.80 was significantly higher than last year and above the high end of our guidance range. While we expected to see a big improvement in profitability this quarter, I can't emphasize enough the importance of our team's agility in delivering this performance, something that's even more notable given that shrink drove nearly a full point of profit pressure versus last year.Now I want to turn briefly to capital deployment and start with our priorities, which have served us well for decades. First, we fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash through share repurchase over time within the limits of our Middle A credit ratings. So far this year, we've made capital expenditures of $2.8 billion and continue to expect full year CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. In the second quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends compared with $417 million last year, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend. And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q2 as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our Middle A credit ratings. And we're encouraged by the progress we've already made, as the combined benefit of a significant profit recovery and lean inventory position have driven a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated $3.4 billion in cash through the first half of this year compared with a slightly negative number through the first half of last year. I'll end my comments on the quarter with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures our current profit performance in the context of our long-term investments. For the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 13.7%. While still healthy in absolute terms and more than 2 percentage points higher than the first quarter, it remains well below the level where we expect to operate over time. Now I'll turn to our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of the year. And today, as we assess the economic and industry backdrop, we continue to see a mixed picture. On the positive side, GDP, employment and overall consumer spending have been resilient, and we're beginning to see a recovery in consumer confidence. On the other side of the ledger, while we're happy to see inflation rates begin to moderate, that's likely to cause some near-term pressure on dollar comps in our frequency categories. In addition, the upcoming resumption of student loan repayments will put additional pressure on the already strained budgets of tens of millions of households. Against this backdrop, we remain cautious in our planning, an approach that has served us really well so far this year. On the top line, we're now planning for comparable sales in a wide range centered around a mid-single-digit decline for the remainder of the year, consistent with what we experienced in July and the second quarter overall. This updated sales expectation is meaningfully softer than our expectation at the beginning of the year. With this change in the top line, we've also adjusted our bottom line guidance and now expect full year GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $7 to $8 range compared with our prior range of $7.75 to $8.75. While multiple factors will determine where our actual results wind up in comparison to this expected range, the single most important variable will be the pace of our sales as we're confident we'll continue to benefit from our efficiency efforts and lean inventory position. In the third quarter, we're expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.20 to $1.60 on a wide range of comparable sales centered around a mid-single-digit decline. In terms of quarterly EPS cadence, I want to take note of a couple of unique circumstances this year. The first is shrink and how that is expected to play out over the next 2 quarters. As I mentioned earlier, based on the high loss rates we're continuing to see, second quarter shrink was consistent with our expectations, and our full year shrink expectations remain unchanged. However, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will look meaningfully different between Q3 and Q4. In Q3, we expect the dollar and rate pressure from shrink will be roughly consistent with the first half of the year at around 90 basis points. However, in Q4, we expect to see a small amount of year-over-year favorability from shrink. I want to stress that this anticipated change in quarterly comparisons does not reflect an expectation that underlying loss rates will begin to improve in Q4. As Brian mentioned, we're working hard, both inside our stores and with government and community partners, to achieve lower loss rates over time. And our long-run expectation is that shrink rates will moderate from today's unsustainable levels. But so far, we've only seen indications that loss rates might soon be reaching a plateau, but have not yet seen evidence that loss rates will begin to come down. So the only reason for the expected change in year-over-year comparisons is the cadence of how shrink was recognized by quarter in the back half of last year, a period when loss rates increased rapidly, resulting in higher shrink accruals at year-end. Because we've seen more consistent loss rates in 2023, quarterly accruals have been more consistent throughout this year. Another important consideration is that 2023 is a 53-week accounting year, so the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that the extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and results in about 30 basis points of operating margin leverage on the quarter. I'll note that the extra week will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length. As I get ready to end my remarks, I want to add my thanks to the entire Target team. From the flexibility they built into our business plans, to their responsiveness in the face of this quarter's top line volatility, and their continued work to enhance our long-term efficiency, they're clearly demonstrating their amazing resilience and showing why we're confident that we work with the best team in retail. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.Brian C. CornellBefore we turn to your questions, I want to pause and reinforce why we're so confident in our long-term prospects, which position us for profitable growth in the years ahead. Retail is an ongoing journey: The continuous process of listening to consumers and rapidly evolving to meet their preferences. To do that well, you need to have the right assets in place which allow you to quickly evolve as your guests' wants, needs and preferences change. And we're proud of the way we have built and strengthened Target's assets over the last decade. During this time, we pioneered and built a unique stores as hubs model and invested in new supply chain capabilities to support that model. We invested billions of dollars in our existing store base, modernizing their shopping experience while optimizing those facilities to support digital fulfillment. We opened new locations in markets that had never been served by a Target store, and we continue to evolve our new store design. We developed and launched industry-leading same-day services, which received some of the highest guest satisfaction ratings of anything we do. Within our assortment, we innovated to make our Food and Beauty businesses even stronger and gained huge amounts of market share along the way. We built an even stronger portfolio of industry-leading owned brands which today generate more than $30 billion in annual sales. We also strengthened our portfolio of national brand partners with Ulta Beauty as the most recent example. At the same time, we developed and launched our Roundel ad business, which leverages the power of our guest base and vendor relationships, to deepen the bond between our guests, our vendors at Target. We also built and launched Target Circle, which has quickly become one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States, providing us with even deeper insights about our guests and how we can serve them. And finally, we invested in our team, the best team in retail, by rapidly increasing their hourly wages and the benefits we provide while building stronger pathways to career development and advancement and designing operational processes to enhance their safety and job satisfaction. With all of these assets in place today, we're not standing still. We're uniquely prepared to navigate into the future, including any uncertainties we'll face. We're committed to carefully listening to our guests and to our team and continuing to invest in capabilities and assets that will best serve our guests, even as their wants and needs and expectations evolve from where they are today. Since no one knows what the future will bring and when new opportunities and challenges will arise, the company's best position to thrive over time are the ones with the tools to adapt. And with our stores, our brands, and our vendor partners, our capabilities and our great team, we have everything we need to deliver long-term growth and success. With that, we'll turn to Q&amp;A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing quarter-to-date. And then if you have any initial reads on what you're seeing with the Back-to-School season.Brian C. CornellMichael, I'm happy to start. Rupesh, obviously, it's very early in the season. But for the first 10 days of August, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. They were very consistent with what we saw in the month of July as guests turn to Target for their Back-to-School and Back-to-College shopping.Michael J. FiddelkeYes. I don't have much to add to that. We knew the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons would be important for us. They always are. Second-biggest seasonal moment for us only next to the holiday season. And it was a season where we expected to have some share opportunities. So like Brian said, 10 days in, so just getting started with the quarter, but we're pleased with what we see so far. And the exciting thing about the balance of the year is we've got a lot of those seasonal moments to come. And we know our business performs so well across all categories in those seasonal moments.Brian C. CornellMichael, the only thing I would add as we think about Back-to-School, and particularly Back-to-College, is we expect the shopping season to extend into September, in fact, throughout the month of September. So we're off to a solid start, it's still very early. But we think this will be a Back-to-School season that extends into September.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhGreat. And then maybe one follow-up question. So at your Analyst Day, you indicated expectations for achieving a 6% operating margin rate as early as FY '24. Just given that weaker top line, is that still in the realm of possibility, of getting up to 6% in your next fiscal year?Michael J. FiddelkeFair question, Rupesh, and one I'm sure we'll come back to over time. Right now, we're laser-focused on delivering a strong back half of the year. We're pleased with the profit recovery we saw in the second quarter. When we headed into this year, the path to 6% was paved with meaningful profit rate improvement in 2023. And I couldn't be more thrilled with the progress the teams are making towards that, as evidenced by the strong profit performance in Q2. And we'll continue to plan cautiously and set the team up for as much agility as possible in the back half of the year. And I would expect that progression on profit to continue through the balance of this year, but more to come at the right time on what we think that long-term trajectory looks like.OperatorOur next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWe wondered if you could talk through gross margins maybe a little bit more. We were curious about how much more markdowns were versus plan given the softness on the discretionary side and some of the merchandising challenges. And what was the offset -- the meaningful offset there?Michael J. FiddelkeYes. Kate, I'm happy to start and welcome, Christina, if you want to add any more color. But the biggest story on the markdown front. I mean, I think we described the promotional environment is rational and really as expected for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, clearly, as you know, Kate, we saw meaningful improvement from last year's excess markdowns and cost to clear inventory. And so as you think about the 5-plus point improvement in margin rate year-over-year, the vast majority of that improvement comes from being cleaner from an inventory respective and saving those costs from last year. And so again, just one more example of, by planning the business cautiously, by positioning with flexibility, and by the team reacting to some of the sales trends we saw in the quarter with urgency, we've been able to keep inventory really clean. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll see as clean of an inventory picture exiting the quarter as we started with, with inventories down 17% in total, down 25% in the discretionary categories. So we feel well managed on the inventory front, and that's showing up with markdowns playing out as expected.A. Christina HenningtonYes, Michael. I wouldn't have a lot to add. We're pleased with the team's agility and we believe that the environment is rational, and we're continuing to build back our profit in light of the circumstances.Katharine Amanda McShaneAnd a follow-up question comes on the heels, I think, of the first question that was asked. But wanted to get a little bit more detail about any changes in consumer behavior within the discretionary categories, especially as traffic got better into July? And just how you're thinking of the discretionary categories in the back half of the year.Brian C. CornellYes. Kate, I think we've continued to see the same trends over really the last year now. Well, I think we see a very resilient U.S. consumer, and I think so much of that is fueled by the strength in the labor market. We continue to see a consumer who is facing high inflationary pressure in Food &amp; Beverage and Essential categories that's absorbing a bigger portion of their wallet. I think as they think about discretionary spending, we've seen a rotation in their wallet from goods into services. You're seeing the uptick in travel and leisure, what's happening in entertainment. So those trends, we expect to continue into the back half of the year. We'll watch it carefully. I think our inventory position allows us the ability to chase into demand, and we'll be ready when we see demand changing as we enter the holiday season. But I think the consumer is still taking a very cautious approach to discretionary spending in the goods sector.OperatorOur next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenRegarding traffic, what's your forecast for traffic that's embedded in guidance? Do you expect it to continue to be in the negative low or negative mid-single-digit range? Also, as we dive a little deeper into the discretionary product assortment, what do you see as opportunities in apparel? And how are you thinking about your overall private label assortment in terms of rebalancing and/or the portfolio relative to non-private label?Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to talk about some of the plans we have in place for the back half of the year, some of the newness we have in our assortment, and some of the exciting new changes we're going to make from an owned brand standpoint?A. Christina HenningtonYes, I'd be happy to. So Oliver, thanks for the question. On the discretionary portfolio, we continue to build our assortment strategy for the long term. We fully believe in our multi-category portfolio, that it offers us an ability to meet the guests' needs in a variety of different times. At the moment, given where the consumer is spending, we're, of course, leading on the strength of our Food &amp; Beverage portfolio and Essentials &amp; Beauty, with Beauty really being a highlight with double-digit growth both in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as our core business. Within discretionary, what we're seeing is that there are things that are very much working around newness and innovation. And as you pointed out, our owned brand portfolio plays a huge role in delivering against those goals. We design, we create, we source, we build assortments that -- where we can control a lot of those elements. And we've introduced a lot of newness whether you think about, even in the last quarter, taking advantage of the hot trend with family tumblers and introducing that and embedding that in Hearth &amp; Hand. We have just relaunched our own brand, Threshold, which is our signature Home brand, with updated aesthetics and great price points and new branding. We continue to lean on opportunities. You'll see us launch a kitchenware brand later this quarter, which we're really excited about for its value, but incredible quality and durability. But beyond those opportunities to introduce innovation, it's really taking advantage of the opportunities where guests can do more in one store at Target, and that happens during those seasonal times, where we can leverage both the strength of Food &amp; Beverage as well as Home or Apparel to complete the trip. And Back-to-School, Back-to-College, as Michael mentioned, is a terrific time for us to showcase the strength of our portfolio. So we'll keep doing what we're doing. We're leaning into different categories, but we're planning appropriately so that we can be responsive in the market.Michael J. FiddelkeAnd Oliver, on traffic, as you know, we don't break out a separate traffic forecast. And so kind of the build that goes into our top line guide is embedded in all the things that underlie it. But a couple of thoughts that, one, I'll just reiterate from my comments. We were pleased with the sequential improvement in July in the quarter, and we saw traffic improve at a slightly faster rate than dollars did as we saw that improvement. And then if you zoom all the way back out, versus 2019, if you look at the first 6 months of this year compared to 2019, I mean, we've got almost well over 20% higher traffic coming to our business than we were pre-pandemic. That translates to 170 million or so more guests interactions with Target in store and online. And so the deeper guest engagement we've built is evidenced by our traffic growth over time, critically important to our prospects going forward.Brian C. CornellI'll try to tie those 2 questions together. During the balance of the year, you'll continue to see us lean into seasonal moments. We know those are very important moments for our guests, those are traffic-driving moments for Target. And to Christina's point, we'll combine great newness with affordability throughout those seasons. If you're in our stores today or looking at target.com, you're seeing us lean into this Back-to-School season with great affordability. We'll continue to do that as we enter the Halloween season, get ready for the holidays, combining that great Target newness with great affordability that meet the needs of our guests. So we'll be cautious as we plan for the back half of the year, but we'll lean into those big seasonal moments where we know the guest expects Target to be there to meet their needs.Oliver ChenBrian, one follow-up. Inclusivity has always been important to Target as well as thinking about stakeholders. What are your thoughts in terms of appealing to the broad array of customers going forward and strategies there, particularly around LGBTQIA+?Brian C. CornellOliver, at the heart of our purpose is our commitment to bring joy to all the families we serve. And that really is all families. So we want to make sure Target is that happy place for all of our guests, a place where they can recharge and enjoy those shopping experiences, and you should expect to see us continue to do that over the years to come.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserThe perception is that Target gained a lot of share over the last few years. And now as its traffic is under pressure, guests are either going elsewhere or Target is losing market share. So what levers can Target pull in order to recapture those who would become disenfranchised or are seeking out value or discretionary goods at other retailers? And how much might it cost to regain those guests that are now shopping elsewhere?Brian C. CornellMichael, I might start by zooming out a bit and kind of looking at our performance over several years. Since the start of the pandemic, we've added over $30 billion of top line growth, a significant increase since 2019. And importantly, that's been driven by an increase in trips and transactions, guests spending more time shopping in our stores. I think the strategy we have in place and have had in place for years will serve us well going forward. We'll continue to make sure we're investing in a great in-store experience. Making sure that we are recommitting to retail fundamentals, which means being in stock every time you shop, providing great affordability, making sure we're leveraging our proximity, providing a great guest experience. That extends into the work we'll do from a fulfillment standpoint. We continue to see our guests turn to Target for same-day services, whether it's Drive-Up or Pick-Up or having something delivered to their home through Shipt. Our owned brand portfolio is now a $30 billion brand portfolio. It's a trusted portfolio of brands that provides great quality and style and affordability. So we'll continue to invest in the strategy that served us so well over the last few years and I believe will continue to serve us well going forward.Michael LasserUnderstood. Our follow-up question is on the operating expense outlook. In light of the traffic declines, presumably, you're adjusting your labor. And on top of that, you're in the midst of harvesting $2 billion to $3 billion of savings over the next couple of years. So can you give us a sense for how your operating dollar growth is going to look in the back half of the year? And are there any onetime factors that are going to benefit your operating expense dollar growth that would not be sustainable moving forward?Michael J. FiddelkeYes, I'm happy to take that one, Michael. I mean, obviously, on the SG&amp;A line, leverage matters. And so the softness we saw in the second quarter showed up in some deleverage on some of those more fixed expenses, especially in an inflationary environment. We still got a fair amount of inflation. And importantly, investments in our team, in wage and benefits on that line as well. But I'll say the team's flexibility in the quarter, not just in SG&amp;A, but across the P&amp;L, was really remarkable. And that starts with well-managed inventories. And we talked about the implications for markdowns on the gross margin line there. But managing inventory well flows across the whole system. I mean, we were heavy last year. That makes us more efficient -- more inefficient in stores when the back rooms are full. It makes us more inefficient in our distribution centers when we're managing a lot of inventory. And so we're seeing the benefits of that cleaner inventories position across the system, and I would expect those benefits to continue. And we've got a team that's really focused on managing costs and expense well in the current environment. And that work on efficiency, to translate the scale gains we've seen over the last few years into a more efficient operation, I would expect that to continue to be fuel in the quarters and years to come on the efficiency front.Brian C. CornellOperator, we have time for one last question today.OperatorOur last question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanI wanted to ask, I don't know the way in which you look at the consumer, whether it's in quintiles or deciles. Can you give us a sense, if you look at the comp that the business is performing, how that spreads across your best customer, your middle customer and then maybe your most occasional customer? And if there's anything we could glean from that and think about how it recovers.Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to share some of the insights we have about the different guests that are shopping our stores today?A. Christina HenningtonYes. I think, obviously, we've seen the -- as Brian talked about, we've seen a rotation in their wallet. And so the guests that are more engaged with our discretionary businesses are now leaning more on into our frequency businesses. But I would tell you a very compelling proof point that came out of the second quarter is how we performed during Target Circle Week. Target Circle Week was Target's opportunity to demonstrate value and give back value to our most loyal customers. This was a shift from prior years, where we did Target Deal Days, and the guests really responded to our actions. In fact, it was our single-largest Target Circle Week ever. We acquired an incremental 500,000-plus guests, which is more than 3.5x the average weeks' acquisition rate, into that loyalty program. A loyalty program, by the way, that already has 100 million members. And so the depth to which we're relating to our guests is going to continue to be fueled by our ability to understand them and serve them uniquely, and Target Circle is one way that we're going to do that.Simeon Ari GutmanAnd then the follow-up, maybe for Michael. If you look at the margin recovery of the business that could happen over, call it, the next year or so, is there anything that stands in the way of it? Meaning if we see comps recover and bounce back, especially that means your signature categories recover, is there any reason why we shouldn't see margins continue along that path? I know you said we'll answer it when we get back to the back half of the year. But is there anything that stands in the way of that margin recovery?Michael J. FiddelkeI think it's the factors we've been talking about for a while now, Simeon. And to see a return to positive comp growth in some of those higher-margin discretionary categories, that would be a welcome benefit to margin, for sure. One of the things we'll need to continue to watch is the pressure we've seen from shortage. If You go back to where we were pre-pandemic, I mean, that is one of the single biggest margin headwinds in the business. And so the path of stabilization, we were pleased to see shortage come in as we forecasted in Q2, but that's still a material headwind on a year-over-year basis, on a 2-year basis. And so I think that will be an important variable to watch going forward as well.Brian C. CornellMichael, on that note, as we wrap up the call today, I certainly want to thank our entire team for their efforts throughout the quarter. I particularly want to recognize our asset protection teams. We've talked a lot over the last couple of quarters about the pressures we've been facing with organized retail crime, and I really appreciate the work that our asset protection teams do each and every day to keep our guests safe, our team safe and allow us to operate safely each and every day. So thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you later this year. That wraps up our second quarter call.OperatorGoodbye.]"

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: There continues to be modest pressure on estimates for Q3 and beyond, but a big part of that is coming from the Energy sector. Outside of the Energy sector, estimates are very stable and are actually increasing for some key sectors. For the 463 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -9.2% from the same period last year on +0.6% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates. We see the above-average Q2 EPS beats percentage as reflective of a favorable turn in underlying earnings trends, particularly since Q2 estimates hadn’t fallen as much as we have seen in other recent quarters. For 2023 Q3, S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -2.3% on +0.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +3.2% on +3.1% higher revenues.  The weak sales numbers from Target TGT – the retailer missed consensus estimates for the top-line and same-store sales – are most likely a function of company-specific execution and merchandising issues, not reflective of moderation in consumer spending.Target has struggled in the post-Covid period, failing to foresee shifts in consumer spending away from discretionary categories like apparel, home furnishings, and electronics, resulting in unsold inventory that then needed to be cleared through markdowns.Target’s Q2 margins were better, and management indicated satisfaction with inventory levels. But investors can’t be faulted for being skeptical of such views, as continuation of Q2’s weak sales and traffic trends in the current and coming quarters will mean the inventory overhang coming back all over again.Story continuesUnlike Walmart WMT, which hasn’t reported results yet but has a much bigger groceries business, Target has all along been seen as more of a play on discretionary merchandise. At the same time, consumer spending on discretionary items of the type that Target specializes in has undoubtedly moderated as demand shifted towards leisure, travel, and related activities. But Target appears to have lost out more than other retailers that sell comparable merchandise, with TJX Companies TJX as a good example of one such retailer.Consumer spending will eventually slow down in response to Fed tightening. However, we didn’t see much evidence of that in the Q1 earnings reports, neither from Walmart and Target nor from other consumer-centric companies.These big-box retail leaders missed due to weak execution and failure to have the right merchandise in stores. Consumers didn’t buy the patio furniture at Walmart or appliances at Target, but they did plenty of shopping at Home Depot HD.The challenge for retailers like Target, Walmart, TJX, and others is not only to have the correct merchandise but also to deal with higher expenses related to freight, payroll, and other items.We have provided the updated Q2 earnings season scorecard for the Zacks Retail sector in the detailed report.Beyond the Retail sector, the 2023 Q2 reporting cycle has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with results from almost 93% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies already out.The blended growth for the quarter is on track for an earnings decline of -8.0% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -3.4% decline in index earnings in the preceding period (2023 Q1) and the -5.4% decline in the last quarter of 2022.In other words, 2023 Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.3%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either, as you can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail. These trends have been confirmed and strengthened by the Q2 earnings results and management’s guidance and commentary for the current and coming quarters.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Marq Claxton, Director of Black Law Enforcement Alliance and a Former NYPD Officer, tells Yahoo Finance live that ""successful outcomes for the thieves"" is driving the activity. ""Until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these types of activities,"" Claxton said. Claxton says both retailers, legislators, and law enforcement will all need to do their parts to help bring these thefts down. Unfortunately, Claxton says he predicts retail crime ""will continue to escalate and get worse."" Claxton fears that as these robberies become more violent and aggressive, there could end up being fatalities, which could ultimately be what it takes for people to take organized retail crime more seriously.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Target CEO spoke out today in its latest earnings call on the unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized crime. The retail giant among many others continuing to face inventory shrink in relation to rising theft this year. As part of Yahoo Finance's week-long special, ""Retail Evolution-- The New Era,"" we're digging deeper into the legal landscape of retail crime.Here to discuss, we've got Marq Claxton, former NYPD detective and Black Law Enforcement Alliance director. Great to talk to you today. You know, Brooke sort of laid out the problem for us. But that 120% jump number that we heard from Target today really standing out in the first five months of the year. What's driving this?MARQ CLAXTON: A successful outcomes for the thieves. They're in a position now where these type of flash robberies, these smash-and-grabs or they've been called mobberies are very lucrative and very successful for them. So until there are things put in place to mitigate damage or to resist this current surge, there's going to be an increase in these type of activities.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: And what should that look like? When we talk about policies that need to be implemented, what should be the priority there?MARQ CLAXTON: It's a multi-pronged approach. I think one thing for certain is that the commercial establishments have to really get back to the basics and work on increasing the technology that's available for safety. They also have to consider inventory, which was touched on just earlier, about inventory, how much inventory can remain in their stores. And then even work on restructuring interior design and designs of their establishments, using some different materials in order to secure inventory.And then there has to be some work done on the part of legislators. And that may require new legislation or enhanced penalties for existing legislation related to these type of robberies, these type of gang robberies, which is what they are, because, in the drop of a dime, they can turn fatal, because there's a tremendous amount of force being used.And then it has to be a collaborative effort on part of law enforcement, increasing resources. And that's a challenge, given the manpower issues that law enforcement is having across the nation. And then the prosecutor's office have to recognize that this is a disturbing trend that needs to be addressed and dealt with quickly and swiftly. And those individuals who engage in it and who are apprehended must face severe penalties.AKIKO FUJITA: Marq, when you look at some of these smash-and-grabs, it doesn't feel like there are certain items that are being targeted. And yet you just said, this continues because, for those criminals, it is lucrative and successful. I mean, what is that secondhand market look like? Where are they selling to? Where are they making their money?MARQ CLAXTON: Well, we have to be mindful that a lot of these more recent smash-and-grabs are involving more high-end materials, high-end stores. And so, you know, they're making a lot of money in selling to online-- online vendors and other underground kind of backdoor establishments that deal in stolen merchandise on a regular basis. So you have this surge of high-end, very expensive product now being available to these underground resources.SEANA SMITH: So, Marq, how do you crack down then on the third-party sellers here. You know, when we talk about the fact that so many of these items are listed on Amazon, they're listed on Walmart. There was a new law that was passed earlier this summer in an effort to try to stem some of this. But it doesn't sound like that this new Informed Consumers Act is really working that well.MARQ CLAXTON: Well, it's still very early. But I think we're on the right course in as far as holding those people responsible who serve as the second line and passing this merchandise over. I mean, quite frankly, throughout the nation, it is a crime to possess stolen property. So if an individual or a merchant has-- is in possession, knowingly in possession of stolen property, they can be held legally accountable right now. So I think we're in the right-- we're going in the right direction. We're trying to make sure that there's kind of a truth in advertising, if you will, and that merchants are paying-- are more responsible for the product that they bring into their stores.AKIKO FUJITA: Marq, you know, when you look at how this has been handled in California, for example, you have the attorney general, who's now teamed up with some of these retailers to try and crack down on organized crime, I mean, how important do you think it is for law enforcement in retail to essentially partner on this issue, just given the scale of the problem at this point?MARQ CLAXTON: It's vitally important. It's necessary in order to have any kind of impact, any kind of positive impact on decreasing these incidents. Like I said, there has to be this kind of collaborative effort on the part of the commercial establishment, the merchants, the law enforcement, the prosecutor's office, and legislators. And we have to really put additional pressure on those third-party vendors of these items as well. So it's important that there is this collaborative effort in order to stem this tide.SEANA SMITH: Marq, do you think we've seen the worst of it when it comes to retail crime? Or could this be a problem that continues to escalate?MARQ CLAXTON: I'm predicting that it will continue to escalate and get worse. There is a certain boldness that's accompanying many of these smashing robberies. And I think unfortunately, it will get worse. And there will unfortunately be some fatalities at some point, because they're becoming more violent, more aggressive, more frequent with more people. So I'm pretty sure, at some point, there's going to be, you know, regrettably a tragic incident connected to it. And I think at that point, there may be the type of focus that we need to pay attention to what's happening.SEANA SMITH: It certainly needs to be a lot of focus on this issue right now given the risk. Marq Claxton, great to get your perspective. Thanks for joining us.MARQ CLAXTON: Thank you.]"

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe global robotics market should reach more than $200 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 22.80% (Market Research Future, 2021).This high double-digit growth should not be overlooked, and will certainly make a lot of investors very rich. Below are my top three must-buy robotics stocks for 2023.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock soared on Thursday, August 3rd after reporting its Q2 2023 financial results. The company saw its net sales up 11% year-over-year, as they ramped up their offerings for same-day and one-day delivery for U.S. prime members. Net income came in at $6.75 billion, while generating $7.9 billion in free-cash-flow from operations. A significant improvement from negative free-cash-flow of $23.5 billion in the trailing twelve months prior. EPS (Earnings Per Share) came in at $0.65, up 425% year-over-year. After a tumultuous year of slow growth in 2022, the company is beginning to re-focus its efforts on customer experience and generative AI.CEO Andy Jassy, said that the company is focused on lowering costs to serve its fulfillment network. They are also concentrating on AWS cloud deployment, with new workloads to serve its robust generative AI strategy. Their suite of AI products include; AWS Tranium, AWS Inferentia, AWS Bedrock, and Codewhisperer. Amazon expects net sales between $138 to $143 billion in Q3 2023, representing a 9-13% increase year-over-year. As the company re-focuses its efforts on cost-cutting and generative AI, its long term growth prospects to serve the robotics market should not be ignored. Story continuesNvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a tear in 2023, thanks to wall street’s optimism on artificial intelligence. Investors have been overly optimistic on Nvidia, as the company ramps up its focus on accelerated computing and generative AI. The company is currently at the forefront of a technological transition that is the largest since the birth of the internet in the 2000s.Nvidia’s advanced graphics processing units will help accelerate AI workloads for the gaming, robotics, energy storage and automotive sector. Their robotics platform, Nividia Isaac, has the potential to be the market leader to address end-to-end solutions for the robotics industry.After reporting their Q1 FY2024 earnings results, the company’s EPS (Earnings Per Share) was up 28% year-over-year. Net income came in at $2.04 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Despite posting strong quarterly financial results, the market may be pricing in too much optimism for Nvidia.Nvidia is currently trading at 43X its FY2024 sales, with a forward price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 60.  To say Nvidia’s valuation is rich would be an understatement. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock is a sell. Despite the company’s lofty valuation, investors should be aware that Nvidia’s AI growth story is only just beginning. You might want to consider holding off on buying the stock until it finds a bottom or dollar-cost-averaging for the long term. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office.

199,842f2afb-1993-37bd-907d-c00236cab34a,BXP,2023-08-17,3 Well-Known REITs Get Surprising Downgrades To Start The Week,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-well-known-reits-surprising-182723115.html,1692210443,STORY,"['BXP', 'EPR', 'WPC']","[Analysts downgrading stocks is an everyday occurrence and certainly nothing out of the ordinary. But it's major news when well-regarded stocks with large followings are the subjects of the downgrades.This week began with downgrades on three popular real estate investment trusts (REITs) across three different subsectors. Two of the downgrades were by the same analyst with Bank of America Securities and one was by an analyst with Argus Research.Take a look at the three REITs that could be in for a decline in share price as a result.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE:BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with 191 properties, as of June 30, concentrated within the six largest cities from Boston to Seattle. The firm calls itself ""the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States."" Its 54.1 million square feet of space is 88.6% leased with a weighted-average lease term of 7.5 years. Many of its properties are rated as premier quality and located in highly desirable areas of the cities.On Aug. 14, Argus Research analyst Marie Ferguson downgraded Boston Properties from Buy to Hold. Rising office vacancies, tepid return-to-office trends and high debt interest expenses are holding back many of the office REITs.But the downgrade is surprising because Boston Properties beat the analyst estimates on both funds from operations (FFO) and revenue in its Aug. 1 second-quarter operating results. The one negative was that despite raising the full-year 2023 FFO guidance, management projected a 4% decrease in midpoint FFO.The downgrade is also surprising, given that on Aug. 9, Wells Fargo analyst Blaine Heck maintained his Overweight position on Boston Properties and raised the price target from $64 to $80.Boston Properties pays a quarterly dividend of $0.98. With the decline in price over the last week, the annual $3.92 dividend now yields 6%.Last year was difficult for Boston Properties, and its total return was negative 40.39%. Year to date in 2023 has been much better, with a total return so far of 3.03%.Story continuesTrending: This REIT You’ve Never Heard Of Is Crushing The Market – Up 36% Over The Past Two YearsWP Carey Inc. (NYSE:WPC) is a New York City-based diversified net-lease REIT, whose single-tenant properties include industrial, warehouse, office, retail and self-storage units. It was founded in 1973 and recently celebrated its 50th year of investing in properties. WP Carey has traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1998 and converted to a REIT in 2012.WP Carey presently has 1,475 net-leased properties with approximately 180 million square feet in 26 different countries. Its portfolio includes 398 tenants from over 30 industries and an occupancy rate of 99%. One important consideration is that 99.1% of its property leases include rent escalators to buffer the inflationary environment prevalent today.WP Carey has raised its quarterly dividend for 98 consecutive quarters, dating to 1999. The annual dividend of $4.28 yields 6.53% and the forward FFO payout ratio is 81.3%. While the payout ratio is a little higher than investors would like to see, it's still easily covering the dividend and has declined over the last few quarters.WP Carey is another REIT that beat the consensus estimates for FFO and revenue in its July 28 second-quarter earnings report.But on Aug. 14, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein downgraded WP Carey from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $78 to $67. Dennerlein is becoming more bearish on net-lease REITs.""Our models already reflect higher interest costs, but risks appear skewed towards further increases in their cost of capital,"" he wrote. ""We will be watching interest rate moves closely.""Dennerlein said he believes that same-store growth has now peaked and that WP Carey will need to dispose of vacant offices going forward.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Heffern still has an Outperform rating and a $79 price target on WP Carey from the end of July.EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a Kansas City, Missouri-based diversified experiential REIT that owns and operates 363 movie theater chains, amusement parks, ski resorts, fitness centers and other recreational venues with over 200 tenants across 44 states.On Aug. 2, EPR Properties reported its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.28 beat the estimates of $1.26 and was up from FFO of $1.17 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $172.19 million crushed the estimates of $148.66 million by 16.31% and was a 7.77% increase over revenue of $160.45 million in the second quarter of 2022.Along with the second-quarter results, EPR Properties also delivered its full-year 2023 guidance of $5.05 to $5.15. The estimated consensus was $4.90.On Aug. 14, Bank of America Securities analyst Dennerlein downgraded EPR Properties from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target from $50 to $45. Dennerlein noted that ""the length of the (Hollywood writer/actor) strike and its impact on content production is the key risk from both an upside/downside perspective on the multiple.""One week earlier, JMP Securities analyst Mitch Germain reiterated his Market Outperform rating on EPR Properties with a $54 price target.One might wonder whether the analyst will readjust EPR Properties' rating should the strike end quickly. If so, the recent price decline from $47.40 to $42.76 could provide investors with an opportunity to pick up share prices with a strong yield. The monthly dividend of $0.275 has a $3.30 annual payout that yields 7.71%.EPR Properties has performed quite well in 2023, with a total return of 21.1%Keep in mind that analysts are only correct with their ratings about 50% of the time, and investors should perform their own due diligence before initiating any stock positions.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

It is poised to reap gains from the housing-driven demand recovery, as it now has eight of the top 10 national builders as its trade customers. WHR remains on track with its long-term targets, with profitable growth of 5-6% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 11%-12%.Whirlpool also remains committed to protecting margins and productivity amid ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures.

OLLI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy on Robust July SalesRetail sales grew in July driven by robust consumer spending, the Commerce Department said on Aug 15. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike campaign is finally bearing fruit as inflation has sharply declined over the past year. The impact is showing in the steady growth in retail sales over the past few months.Given this situation, investing in stocks like The Gap, Inc., The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc. and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. will be a wise option.Retail Sales JumpRetail sales jumped a solid 0.7% to $696.4 billion in July, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4%, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding autos, retail sales rose a solid 1% in July, surpassing expectations of a 0.4% rise. This follows a 0.2% rise in June.This has so far been the best reading since January 2023. Also, e-commerce sales increased a robust 1.9%, while sales at restaurants and bars rose 1.4%. Sales at sporting goods stores climbed 1.5%.The report indicates that the U.S. economy is still going strong and might avoid slipping into a recession. The jump in retail sales comes as inflation continues to steadily decline from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July for the first time in more than 12 months. The modest rise in July indicates that there is still solid demand for goods, which is driving sales.Story continuesOn a year-over-year basis, retail sales rose 3.2% in July, in line with the annual CPI increase.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with June being the only exception. This has taken the benchmark borrowing rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, a steady decline in inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its current interest rate hike campaign.

We had expected a comparable sales drop of 2.1% and a comparable store sales decline of 1.4% for the quarter under discussion.MarginsThe gross margin expanded 550 basis points to 27%, reflecting lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, the benefits of lower freight costs, retail price increases, and lower supply chain and digital fulfillment costs. These were partly offset by higher inventory shrink. Meanwhile, the operating margin increased to 4.8% from 1.2% in the year-ago period.We had expected year-over-year improvements of 410 basis points and 280 basis points in the gross margin and operating margin rates, respectively, for the quarter under review.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,617 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $14,926 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,990 million.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Ross Stores and Costco are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ROST likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than COST has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.94, while COST has a forward P/E of 38.81. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. COST currently has a PEG ratio of 4.41.Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 9.05. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, COST has a P/B of 10.50.Based on these metrics and many more, ROST holds a Value grade of B, while COST has a Value grade of C.Story continuesROST stands above COST thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ROST is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Excluding autos, retail sales rose a solid 1% in July, surpassing expectations of a 0.4% rise. This follows a 0.2% rise in June.This has so far been the best reading since January 2023. Also, e-commerce sales increased a robust 1.9%, while sales at restaurants and bars rose 1.4%. Sales at sporting goods stores climbed 1.5%.The report indicates that the U.S. economy is still going strong and might avoid slipping into a recession. The jump in retail sales comes as inflation continues to steadily decline from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July for the first time in more than 12 months. The modest rise in July indicates that there is still solid demand for goods, which is driving sales.On a year-over-year basis, retail sales rose 3.2% in July, in line with the annual CPI increase.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with June being the only exception. This has taken the benchmark borrowing rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, a steady decline in inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its current interest rate hike campaign.

The DOJ declined to comment and Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Both Visa and rival Mastercard are facing increasing scrutiny for their dominance in the payments market.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission started an investigation last October into whether Visa and Mastercard's security tokens restrict debit-card routing in online payments.Visa disclosed last month that the DOJ's antitrust division had on May 2 demanded additional documents and information on its debit card practices in the United States and competition with other payment networks.Mastercard also disclosed in April that it was being asked to provide additional information by the DOJ.In 2019, Visa had settled a European Union antitrust probe relating to card fees.

(NYSE:V) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaThe Vice Chair, Kelly Tullier, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.1m worth of shares at a price of US$233 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$240). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 50% of Kelly Tullier's stake.In the last year Visa insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Visa better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of VisaFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, currently worth about US$246m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Visa Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Visa shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Visa insiders selling. Of course, the future is what matters most.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S and Medtronic plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa shares have modestly outperformed rival Mastercard this year (+15.8% vs. +13.8%), but somewhat lagged the S&amp;P 500 index (+15.8% vs. +18.4%). The stock has done better than the equal-weighted version of index, given the strong performance of a few megacap Tech stocks.The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. For fiscal 2023, our estimate for revenues indicates almost 11.1% year-over-year growth.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid its overall performance. It reported solid fiscal third-quarter results thanks to higher cross-border volumes. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress its margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. Its volumes are likely to see diminishing effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As such, it warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+71.3% vs. +22.7%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the market. Saxenda and Wegovy sales have been gaining momentum.Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs are likely to further boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view along with its second-quarter results, expecting better sales of its GLP-1 diabetes products. Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging.However, competition is getting stiffer from pharma bigwigs like Pfizer, who are likely to eat away from Novo Nordisk’s Diabetes care market share. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market also remain a woe.(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Medtronic shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past six months (+0.4% vs. -1.9%). The company is strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for advanced medical technologies.

Only Visa can unlock the token.DoJ officials have now begun to investigate Visa's policy of charging retailers more if they choose not to use this technology, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The probe is the latest development in a more than two-year investigation by the DoJ into allegations that Visa is attempting to monopolize the debit card market.Shares in Visa were little changed in early trading.San Francisco-based Visa argues that the technology, which it first introduced in 2014, helps protect digital payments as cardholder information passes from merchants to banks. More than 4 billion tokens have now been issued, with 13,000 retailers using the service.Spokespeople for Visa and Justice Department officials declined to comment, Bloomberg said.According to a document seen by Bloomberg, merchants were informed in recent weeks that Visa and its partners would be rolling out routine fee adjustments.In particular, the new plan would charge merchants higher rates if they chose not to use Visa's tokenization technology than if they opted in to the service, the documents cited by Bloomberg showed. Sources told Bloomberg that this announcement is what revived the DoJ's interest in tokenization.The report comes after Visa peer Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reached a settlement in December with the Federal Trade Commission over its tokenization practices. Mastercard was alleged to have used the technology to prevent merchants from using alternate payment networks. It ultimately agreed to grant these alternate networks access to customers' personal account details.Story continuesRelated ArticlesVisa faces Justice Department probe into 'token' pricing - BloombergIsrael stocks lower at close of trade; TA 35 down 0.35%ViaSat's Inmarsat acquisition a positive, but ViaSat-3 complications 'pose a meaningful headwind' - JPMorgan]"

T-Mobile’s equipment revenue fell 23% last quarter, while AT&amp;T’s slipped 7% and Verizon’s postpaid phone upgrades dropped 34%.Executives partly blame smartphone makers and say customers are content waiting longer between upgrades. Verizon Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg said on a recent earnings call that there hasn’t been any “major” new devices recently, while T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Peter Osvaldik said customers are “happy with their devices” for longer time frames.The turnaround comes after a surge in demand of wireless devices during the Covid-19 pandemic — revenues hit about $6 billion per carrier in the last quarter of 2020 when stimulus checks, product promotions and nationwide lockdowns spurred consumers to upgrade their electronic devices. Now, consumers have returned to pre-pandemic upgrade cycles as networks pull back on promotions.Almost a third of new phone buyers in March had kept their old device for at least three years, up from just 20% in March last year, analysis by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners shows. The average age of a North American’s smartphone rose to three-and-a-half years last quarter, according to Assurant Inc. Earlier this month, Apple Inc. posted its third straight quarter of declining sales, while other phone makers, including Samsung Electronics Co., have also seen sales of their devices slow or remain flat.Story continuesThe decline in revenues isn’t necessarily bad for telcos. “Lower equipment sales are a good thing for the carriers,” New Street Research LLP Managing Partner Jonathan Chaplin said, as they often lose money on smartphone sales due to promotional discounts. “If the upgrade rate declines, they are subsidizing fewer handsets, and their margins expand,” he said.Still, less enticing smartphone upgrades could pose a problem for the wireless carriers’ all-important service revenues, making up about three-quarters of total sales, as they rely on offerings like free phones to bring in new customers and fuel growth.New Street’s Chaplin sees upgrades and equipment revenues continuing to decline through the end of the year absent a “blockbuster” iPhone launch in September or October. Though even Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has limited visibility: “It’s very difficult to estimate real time what is going on with the upgrade cycle,” he said on a recent earnings call.Slowing subscriber growth has weighed on carriers’ shares this year. AT&amp;T is down 23%, Verizon has dropped 16%, and T-Mobile, which recently had its best second quarter in eight years, is down about 1%.--With assistance from Scott Moritz.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSorry, But LinkedIn Is Cool NowChina’s Debt-Fueled Housing Market Is Having a Meltdown, AgainDrug Benefit Firms Devise New Fees That Go to Them, Not ClientsNever Mind Shrinking Households, Builders Are Adding BedroomsCow-Free Dairy Wants to Beat the Fake Foods Curse, But First … Those Prices©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company began notifying customers via email and SMS on July 18, she said.The move follows similar actions taken by telecom rivals T-Mobile and Verizon in trying to incentivize AutoPay customers to switch from using credit cards to using bank accounts or debit cards for payments, according to a report in Payments Dive.According to a T-Mobile support page, payments must be made with a debit card or linked bank account to be eligible for its free AutoPay service.Streamlining payment methodsA T-Mobile spokesperson told Kiplinger the company has made changes to its AutoPay discount eligibility as it streamlines its payment methods.“The majority of our customers use their bank account or debit card for AutoPay and will continue to get a discount,” the T-Mobile spokesperson said in a statement. “Customers who use AutoPay with a credit card can update their payment method to bank transfer or debit card to keep the discount.”T-Mobile began notifying customers in May to update their payment method, she added.Verizon did not respond to requests for comment.According to its website, $5 or $10 per month AutoPay and paper-free discounts are available for those who sign up online or by phone using their bank account, debit card or Verizon Visa Card.The push to incentivize customers to move away from credit card transactions is seen as a response to the credit card processing fees paid by vendors.As Kiplinger recently reported, a bipartisan bill is making its way through Congress that seeks to lower those processing fees by increasing competition in the Visa- and Mastercard-dominated processing network by requiring major banks to add other credit card network platforms.Related ContentHow Do Credit Cards Work?

The Company believes presenting these non-GAAP measures, which exclude items that are not comparable from period to period, is useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, the Company believes presenting these metrics on a constant currency basis will help investors and analysts to understand the effect of significant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on these performance measures and provide a framework to assess how business is performing and expected to perform excluding these effects.The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Percentage increases/decreases in net sales for the Company and each segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and compared to the same periods in the prior quarter and fiscal year. The Company calculates constant currency net sales results by translating current period net sales in local currency using the prior year period’s currency conversion rate.Net sales changes for the Company and each segment are based on absolute sales dollar changes and are not presented in accordance with the Company’s comparable sales definition utilized historically due to the uncertain business environment resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The segment gross profit and segment SG&amp;A expenses presented in the Condensed Consolidated Segment Data, and GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation Table above, as well as SG&amp;A expense ratio, and operating margin, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program costs for the quarter and fiscal year ended on July 2, 2022 and Debt Extinguishment costs for the fiscal year ended on July 2, 2022. In addition, segment Operating Income (loss), Loss on extinguishment of debt, Provision for income taxes, Net income (loss), and Net Income (loss) per diluted common share, have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program costs for the quarter and fiscal year ended on July 2, 2022 and Debt Extinguishment costs for the fiscal year ended on July 2, 2022.There were no items affecting comparability in the quarter and fiscal year ended on July 1, 2023.The Company also presents free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is calculated by taking the ""Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities"" less ""Purchases of property and equipment"" from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

ANGO recently announced the receipt of the FDA’s Breakthrough Device designation for its AngioVac System for the proposed indications for use to include the non-surgical removal of vegetation from the right heart. Following the FDA’s grant of the Breakthrough Device designation, AngioDynamics will engage with the FDA to achieve the new expanded indication for the non-surgical removal of the vegetation.The latest FDA recognition is expected to significantly solidify AngioDynamics’ foothold in the niche space and strengthen its Med Tech segment globally.Significance of the DesignationThe AngioVac System uses a venous drainage cannula to remove thrombi (a blood clot formed within the vascular system of the body) or emboli during extracorporeal bypass for up to six hours.The FDA Breakthrough Device designation is designed to help patients gain timely access to medical devices that may provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions for which no approved or cleared alternatives currently exist.Per management, the FDA’s recognition of the AngioVac System reflects its potential to provide a novel and innovative treatment pathway for the non-surgical removal of vegetation from the right heart. Management believes that the recognition will likely be a significant step toward advancing patient care.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global thrombectomy devices market was valued at $1.3 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $2.6 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.4%. Factors like the increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and growth in demand for minimally invasive procedures are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory recognition raises optimism about AngioDynamics.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, AngioDynamics announced the completion of enrolment and final treatment in its Pivotal Study of the NanoKnife System for Ablation of Prostate Tissue in an Intermediate-Risk Patient Population (PRESERVE).Story continuesIn July, AngioDynamics reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in the overall top line.

PDCO scaled a new 52-week high of $34.46 on Aug 15, before closing the session slightly lower at $33.83.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 14.5% compared with the 11.2% rise of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 4.2% growth.Over the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 6% compared with the industry’s 8.8% rise. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 9.2% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 12.2%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 4.5%.Patterson Companies is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its broad product line. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and a few notable acquisitions are expected to contribute further. Integration risks and stiff competitive forces persist.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversBroad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal, while it continues adding stock-keeping units to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Acquisitions: We are upbeat about Patterson Companies’ strategy of expanding its business via strategic acquisitions. In January, it announced that it had, through subsidiaries, completed the previously-announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies.In December 2022, Patterson Companies announced that it had, through a subsidiary, closed the previously announced acquisition of substantially all the assets of Dairy Tech, Inc.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Patterson Companies’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. Strength in the overall top line, value-added Services and Other business of the Dental segment and the overall Animal Health segment was witnessed. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the company. Prudent cost-saving initiatives and solid sales execution continue to favor Patterson Companies.DownsidesStiff Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies needs to continue to introduce newer products in the market to withstand competitive pressures. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Integration Risks: Patterson Companies has been on an acquisition spree which is improving its revenue opportunities, but aggravating integration risks. Regular acquisitions are also a distraction for management, which is likely to impact organic growth. This may limit Patterson Companies’ future expansion and worsen the company’s risk profile, going forward.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and McKesson Corporation MCK.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.5%.

245,e6b236a7-6aca-3166-bfec-094c0cdb526d,APD,2023-08-17,The 3 Best Hydrogen Stocks to Buy in August,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-hydrogen-stocks-buy-110045779.html,1691751645,STORY,"['GS', 'BE', 'APD']","[With the world going green, some of the most explosive opportunities can be found in hydrogen stocks. Analysts at Markets and Markets say the market could be worth $410.6. billion by 2030. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says we could be looking at a $1 trillion opportunity by 2050. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy just said it would invest $1 billion in hydrogen production projects as part of its Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program, creating a big opportunity for some of the leading hydrogen stocks.Even better, hydrogen emits no greenhouse gases when it’s burned. Instead, the only waste product is water, making it even more desirable than natural gas and oil. With that said, now is the best time to jump into leading hydrogen stocks.Leading Hydrogen Stocks: Air Products and Chemicals (APD)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockOne of the top, most oversold hydrogen opportunities is Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD). All after, it gapped from $304 to $285.40 on earnings. While it posted better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $595.6 million, or $2.67 a share, it missed on revenues, which fell 5% year over year to $3 billion. The company also narrowed its full-year guidance, now seeing earnings per share (EPS) of $11.40 to $11.50 a share, as compared to prior guidance of $11.30 to $11.50.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the negativity priced into the gap, I’d use weakness as an opportunity. For one, APD is now technically oversold on relative strength, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Two, the last time APD became this technically oversold, it bounced from about $270 to $304. Helping things, analysts at Mizuho just raised their price target on APD to $330 from $322, with a Buy rating.Even better, APD recently declared a dividend of $1.75 a share. APD has a current yield of 2.44%.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockI’d also use weakness as an opportunity with Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE). After running from about $13 to $18.70, the stock dropped to around $15, finding support. From here, I’d like to see BE challenge $18.70 again initially, with a long-term target of $24. Helping, JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) just raised its price target to $22 from $20 a share.Story continuesWhile recent earnings took it down, most of that negativity is now priced in. Not only did it miss on EPS, it missed revenue targets too. Again, not to sound like a broken record, but I’d use that weakness as an opportunity to buy. Plus, we have to consider Bloom just unveiled two new products that could boost growth moving forward. For one, its Series 10 energy server is expected to meet the needs of those in the data center market.Two, it also just launched its advanced Combined Heat and Power (CHP) solution, which uses high-temperature exhaust steam for industrial steam production and absorption chilling, as noted by the company. “Bloom’s advanced CHP solution is particularly attractive to the world’s largest CHP markets in Germany, South Korea, Italy, Japan and the United States, where almost half of the operating CHP systems are over 20 years old and ready for replacement,” they added.Global X Hydrogen ETF (HYDR)A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.Or, if you simply want to diversify with several big hydrogen names at a lower overall cost, look into ETFs such as the Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ:HYDR). With an expense ratio of 0.5%, the ETF offers exposure to companies involved in the production and integration of hydrogen and the development and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cells.Some of its top holdings include Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Bloom Energy, Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP), ITM Power (OTCMKTS:ITMPF), and FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) — to name a few. HYDR has also become oversold after pulling back from about $10.50 to $9.40. From here, I’d like to see an initial retest of $10.30, with a potential test of $12 shortly after.If hydrogen can become the explosive market many expect, ETFs and related stocks could push aggressively higher. The time to buy is now on pullbacks.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

LKQ.Industry: Auto PartsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2136841/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-riding-the-industrys-optimismAging vehicles are a key catalyst for the bright prospects of the Zacks Automotive Replacement Parts industry. In a bid to ensure the sustained operability of their older vehicles, consumers are opting to invest in the substitution of defective parts and constituents. Additionally, integration of e-commerce and soaring popularity of technologically advanced vehicles are revolutionizing the industry. However, commodity cost inflation, forex woes and logistical challenges may pose concerns. Industry participants like Genuine Parts Company and LKQ Corp. stand out favorably due to their strategic acquisitions and investor-friendly initiatives.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts.The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Factors at PlayVehicle Longevity a Key Driver: According to the S&amp;P Global Mobility report released in May, the mean age of automobiles in the United States reached 12.5 years in 2023. This marks the sixth consecutive year of rise in the average age of vehicles and the most substantial annual upturn since the recession of 2008-2009. The escalated pace of the average light vehicle age's growth brings advantages to the automotive replacement sector. A more aged collection of vehicles implies an ongoing requirement for repair and maintenance to uphold proper functionality.Story continuesTypically aligned with the advancement in the mean vehicle age, the industry's course is experiencing growth, as consumers allocate more resources to sustain the operation of their maturing automobiles. Consequently, there has been a noticeable upsurge in the demand for automotive replacement parts.New Opportunities Arising from Technology: The automotive sector is experiencing a transformative shift, driven by the widespread integration of cutting-edge technology and swift digitization, resulting in a complete overhaul of the market landscape. This transformation has opened up new growth avenues for the auto replacement parts industry. As the electrification and autonomous driving trends gain momentum, industry participants are redoubling their efforts to engineer technologically sophisticated components.Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced technologies and components that may require replacement over time. This includes electronic systems, sensors and other specialized parts that contribute to the growth of replacement part demand.Digitization Ramp up: The surge of e-commerce and online retail has reshaped the auto replacement parts industry by providing unprecedented accessibility, diversity of options and convenience for consumers. Through online platforms, customers can easily compare a wide array of replacement parts, read reviews, and access comprehensive product information, enabling informed purchasing decisions. The global reach of e-commerce allows customers to source specialized parts from various regions. This digital transformation benefits both “Do-It-Yourself” enthusiasts and professional mechanics, streamlining the process of finding and acquiring the necessary components. Overall, e-commerce has empowered consumers, expanded market access, and revolutionized the industry's growth trajectory by enhancing customer engagement and choice.Cost-Related Challenges are Concerning: The emergence of highly advanced automotive components is exerting notable pressure on the profit margins of auto replacement parts. Escalating commodity costs compound these issues and could potentially undermine profitability. Additionally, the widespread international footprint of many industry participants renders them vulnerable to foreign exchange complexities. Adverse currency conversions might affect earnings and margins. Moreover, the industry is contending with logistical hurdles and supply chain disruptions, which serve to further curtail potential growth prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector.

Parade gets acquired, women are being replaced by men in the C-suites of retail's biggest companies, and Cummins' CEO builds on a 104-year-old legacy. Have a wonderful Wednesday!- Powerful leadership. Jennifer Rumsey grew up in Columbus, Ind. It didn't mean much to her at the time, but the city is the headquarters of Cummins, a 104-year-old manufacturer that produces power generators and diesel engines.Rumsey started working for Cummins 24 years ago and became the company’s CEO this time last year. With revenues of $28 billion, Cummins is ranked No. 146 on the Fortune 500, making Rumsey one of the 52 female CEOs who lead 10.4% of Fortune 500 businesses.As she marks one year in the CEO job for her hometown manufacturer, Rumsey is reflecting on what drew her to Cummins and what has kept her there for more than two decades. In college, she studied mechanical engineering and got a job working for a fuel cell startup, which she thought would be integral to the future of environmentally-friendly energy. But the experience didn’t feel rewarding. “I realized I was working long hours on a technology that was far from being actually used by a customer and making a real impact in the world,” she says.Cummins CEO, Jennifer RumseyShe arrived at Cummins as the company was focused on reducing the environmental impact of diesel engines used in trucking, agriculture, marine power, and more. That felt like it had more of a real-world impact.Rumsey has risen through the ranks, overseeing several different engineering categories and Cummins’ components business before serving as chief technical officer and then CEO.Her approach to leadership is inspired by her experience as a woman in engineering—""I have had people comment that I don't look like an engineer""—and by the business leaders who preceded her. Cummins' longtime CEO J. Irwin Miller was an early believer in stakeholder capitalism, which acknowledges the needs of employees and communities, not just shareholders. As leader of the National Council of Churches, he helped organize the 1963 March on Washington; later, the company exited South Africa during the apartheid regime. (Miller was also known for his contributions to modern architecture.) Miller died in 2004, just a few years after Rumsey joined the company.Story continuesFor Rumsey, continuing that legacy means building a diverse team and addressing the company’s role in climate change through various commitments to develop new technologies, reach net-zero, and reduce greenhouse gasses. The company says it reduced greenhouse gasses 31% between 2018 and 2021.“As I was becoming CEO, I realized that we are really at a unique and critical time for our business—and for our world,” she says. “Climate change is a real crisis. And we have a responsibility and a role to play in helping to address it.”Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

Sinclair's actions defrauded Diamond and its creditors, because Sinclair knew that Diamond was ""careering toward bankruptcy"" due to declining revenue from cable and satellite television subscriptions, according to the lawsuit.""Throughout this entire period of precipitous decline, Sinclair unrelentingly continued to carry out its plan to 'milk' Diamond for Sinclair's own benefit and to extract whatever value it could salvage before Diamond's inevitable bankruptcy,"" Diamond wrote in a complaint filed in U.S. bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas.Sinclair said on Wednesday that Diamond's claims were without merit and that it would vigorously defend itself. Sinclair said last month that it was aware that Diamond had filed a lawsuit under seal.Sinclair acquired Diamond, which previously broadcast games under the ""Fox Sports"" brand, in a $10 billion deal that helped clear the way for Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets.Diamond's complaint alleges that Sinclair quickly used Diamond's funds to pay off part of Sinclair’s costs in acquiring the company. Sinclair later collected ""extortionate"" management fees from Diamond and pocketed most of the money raised in a deal that rebranded Diamond’s channels as ""Bally Sports,"" according to the complaint.Diamond filed for bankruptcy in March, seeking to finalize a settlement with its lenders and renegotiate its MLB contracts. Diamond has said it needs the right to stream baseball games online to make up for lost revenue from declining customer cable subscriptions.

Iger was asked by MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson on the company earnings call if he would consider splitting the company into two. Nathanson’s thesis would be that the first company would be comprised of the parts of the business that are working better, such as the theme parks, Disney+, and Walt Disney Studios. The second company would be comprised of ventures that are struggling or carrying more debt, such as the linear TV networks, ESPN+ and Hulu. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the implications of a potential split up of Disney.Video Transcript- Disney CEO, Bob Iger, facing a series of headwinds from box office bombs to slowing park revenues and a linear TV business that's in freefall. While Iger is seeking solutions to some of those issues, one analyst is suggesting that the entertainment giant should consider breaking itself up. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the details. Allie, what's the case for this?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I know it's a loaded question, right. And this was first introduced by MoffettNathanson analyst, Michael Nathanson. He asked Iger point blank on the earnings call, would you consider splitting Disney into two companies? And this is his thesis.Company number one would be the good part of Disney. So that would be the theme parks, Disney+, and the film studios. Obviously, that studio IP incredibly important.And company number two, that would basically be the bad stuff that you don't want, the linear networks which Iger has already suggested that he would want to sell off.Now, this is complicated with ESPN since Iger has been very bullish on ESPN. He eventually wants to take the network fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer service. And you'd also have Hulu with the live TV option as well. And the Disney+ Indian brand, Disney Hotstar, would be included in company number two.Story continuesSo he says that would allow Disney to unload some of that debt, would allow it to create more value on the good parts of the business because he thinks right now within the current structure, that's undervalued, being dragged down by some of those linear network headwinds.However, it's very complicated because Disney is a company that really feeds on different parts of the business to run the engine. The parks feeds off of the studios, the success there. Linear networks, that generates a ton of cash that Disney can then feed into the streaming side of the business.So I spoke with Bank of America analyst, Jessica Reif Ehrlich, who said she's not necessarily in the camp that Disney should separate itself. That being said, Bob Iger has made it clear that there are a lot of options currently on the table. And that is certainly one possibility that you could see down the line. And it's something that we've heard a lot in Hollywood, right, unlocking value.Paramount Global, that's one company that's often been looked at as a company where you could probably get a lot of value for parts of that business. So if you sell off BET, if you sell off Showtime, which there's already been reportedly interest from a lot of buyers, that could unlock some value. We see Lionsgate spinning off its Starz business.So this is something that's really a phenomenon especially for these legacy media companies that are going through a lot of challenges right now. The question is, though, is this the right move for Disney specifically? So we'll see.AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, the other question, Allie, I have is, number one, is it the right move, how realistic is it. But also, then what happens to those linear assets? And I'm not just talking about Disney. I mean, you just brought up a point of companies trying to unlock value. Nothing in that proposition points to the linear assets that exist. So then what happened?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and I think that's a good point. Who will buy the linear networks, especially if ESPN is not included in that, right? ESPN is one of the biggest value propositions.And Jessica Reif, she brought up an interesting point too, that how can ESPN maintain its value if it's not on ABC and you don't have access to some of those stations. Yes, linear viewership is declining. But the reach that that has is still very significant and is still largely tied to the ESPN part of the company.And that's something that I don't even think Bob Iger has fully figured out. There have been some articles out there that he's a bit anxious about this. Although he did put it out there to the world, if there's anyone interested, I'm open to conversations. So he clearly knows he has to do something, that the stock price has been on a decline. There have been a lot of challenges throughout different parts of the business. Even the parks, which has long been the storied part of the entire company, really the lifeline, there has been some softness there in terms of attendance. So you need to shake things up.And even Iger said on the call, I'm not sure what that is yet. I'd welcome different types of opinions. Now he has Kevin Meyer and Tom Staggs, former executives at the company advising him on this. So that's something that I think he's very focused on, especially even before we can name a successor, which is part of the reason why they extended his contract.- He certainly has some tough decisions to make, it sounds like, over the next couple of years. All right, Allie. Thanks.]"

The two sides settled the suit for an undisclosed sum.TSG, which is based in New York, helps to fund the production and marketing costs of films in exchange for a share of the profits.TSG Entertainment helped provide funding for a number of high-profile films, including Avatar: The Way of Water - 20th Century Studios via APThe company has co-financed more than 140 films made by 20th Century Fox, which Disney acquired as part of a $71bn (£13bn) takeover of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment business in 2019.It said it has spent $3.3bn over the last decade on titles including The Banshees of Inisherin, The Menu, Jojo Rabbit, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Deadpool.TSG recently requested an audit of three of the films it co-financed after noticing a decline in its profits. The company alleges it found “rampant self-dealing” and “accounting tricks” that showed it had been underpaid by $40m.The lawsuit claimed: “At its root, it is a chilling example of how two Hollywood behemoths with a long and shameful history of Hollywood accounting, defendants Fox and Disney, have tried to use nearly every trick in the Hollywood accounting playbook to deprive plaintiff TSG — the financier who, in good faith, invested more than $3.3 billion with them — out of hundreds of millions of dollars.”Story continuesTSG said its audit also found that it was not credited with revenue it should have received and was charged tens of millions of dollars for distribution fees that were not part of its agreement.In addition, the financier claimed that Disney’s renegotiated licensing deal with Warner Bros Discovery in 2021 cut into its potential profits. It also accused Disney of blocking its attempt to sell stakes in other films, which in turn prevented it from investing more in hits such as Avatar: The Way of Water.TSG, which was founded by Wall Street brothers Chip and Robert Seelig, has longstanding relationships with a number of Hollywood studios. It is being represented by John Berlinski, the same lawyer who represented Ms Johansson.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

One might think so, looking at oil bulls’ optimism Thursday after the vow by Beijing’s central bank to get its economy moving.Crude prices rose for the first time in four days, tacking on more than $1 per barrel in the latest session, while remaining down on the week after the pledge by the PBOC, or People’s Bank of China, which now has to be matched by action.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled Thursday’s trade up $1.01, or 1.3%, at $80.39 a barrel. WTI lost 4.6% in three prior sessions, leaving it down more than 3% on the week.That was a breakaway from a previous seven-week rally triggered by a bull fervor over Saudi production cuts that lifted the U.S. crude benchmark by 20% in that period, resulting in a 9-month high of $84.89 for a barrel.London-based Brent crude finished the New York session up 67 cents, or 0.8%, at $84.12. Week-to-date, Brent was down around 3% after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return and a seven-month high of $88.10.The oil rally ran into trouble this week after one bad patch of economic data after another released by China, the world’s top crude importer. July was a particularly woeful month for what is also the world’s number two economy, with bank loans sliding to a 14-year low; consumer and producer prices declining and exports sliding their most since February 2020.

Prior to these two weeks, the agency had not projected such a high number for output, following the record 13.1M barrels produced daily before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020.Crude stockpiles fell by 5.960M barrels during the week ended Aug. 11, after the build of 5.851M in the prior week to Aug. 4, the EIA said. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.com had forecast a decline of just 2.32M for last week.The EIA’s reporting on crude stockpiles has turned volatile in recent weeks, with the agency citing a record draw of 17.049M barrels two weeks ago, as global stockpiles see shifts from a Saudi bid to cut an additional million barrels per day from their shipment while Chinese buying slows.A closer examination of the EIA weekly report showed last week’s crude draw possibly result from a spike in U.S. crude exports, which rose to 4.599M barrels from a prior 2.36M.On the gasoline inventory front, there was a draw of 0.261M after the prior week’s 2.661M slide. Analysts had forecast a draw of as much as 1.26M for last week.While automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product, demand for it has been lackadaisical this summer, with draws often coming below analysts' calls and weekly builds sometimes registered in the place of draws.With distillate stockpiles, there was a surprise build of 0.296M versus a forecast draw of 0.473M and the prior week’s decline of 1.706M.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 1.58, the question arises: Is the stock modestly undervalued? This article delves into a comprehensive valuation analysis of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). So, let's delve in.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CMCSA. Click here to check it out. CMCSA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CMCSAComcast Corp is a multifaceted entity, owning networks capable of providing television, internet access, and phone services to nearly half of the U.S. homes and businesses. With its acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric in 2011, and Sky in 2018, Comcast has solidified its presence in the media and entertainment industry. The company's stock price currently stands at $47.03, with a market cap of $194 billion. Our GF Value estimates the stock's fair value at $53.8, suggesting that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) may be modestly undervalued.Comcast (CMCSA): A Modestly Undervalued Investment Opportunity?A Summary of GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary calculation of a stock's intrinsic value, incorporating historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.At its current price of $47.03 per share, Comcast has a market cap of $194 billion and appears to be modestly undervalued. Because Comcast is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Comcast (CMCSA): A Modestly Undervalued Investment Opportunity?Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Comcast has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.07, which ranks worse than 80.75% of companies in the Telecommunication Services industry. The overall financial strength of Comcast is 4 out of 10, indicating poor financial strength.Story continuesComcast (CMCSA): A Modestly Undervalued Investment Opportunity?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Comcast has been profitable 10 years over the past decade. Its operating margin is 19.11%, which ranks better than 75.9% of companies in the Telecommunication Services industry. Overall, the profitability of Comcast is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is one of the most crucial factors in a company's valuation. Comcast's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 56.54% of companies in the Telecommunication Services industry. However, Comcast's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -6.6%, which ranks worse than 77.84% of companies in the Telecommunication Services industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. For the past 12 months, Comcast's ROIC is 5.31, and its cost of capital is 8.15.Comcast (CMCSA): A Modestly Undervalued Investment Opportunity?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) appears to be modestly undervalued.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 9.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share, indicating a change of -33.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.58 points to a change of -32.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of +11.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.96 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -27%. The $15.49 billion and $16.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.2% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. EPS of $1.18 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.23%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

271,448cfcc9-2844-3aa0-98f4-48ebde5f20fe,MU,2023-08-17,Brokers Suggest Investing in Micron (MU): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-micron-mu-133006244.html,1692192606,STORY,['MU'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.57, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.57 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70.4% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$4.56.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron.

MU 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MUMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the world's largest suppliers of memory chips. Its DRAM and NAND products are found in a diverse range of devices - from PCs and data centers to smartphones and automotive systems. As of August 15, 2023, Micron Technology's stock was trading at $65.33 per share, significantly higher than its fair value (GF Value) of $42.82. With a market cap of $71.60 billion, the company's stock seems to be significantly overvalued.Is Micron Technology Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisA Closer Look at the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that reflects the intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line, visible on our summary page, represents the fair trading value of the stock. This calculation is based on historical trading multiples, an internal adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates.According to our valuation method, Micron Technology appears to be significantly overvalued. The stock's price is notably above the GF Value Line, suggesting that its future return may be poor. However, if the price were significantly below the GF Value Line, it could indicate an undervalued stock with potentially high future returns.Is Micron Technology Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisFinancial Strength of Micron TechnologyInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before buying its stock. Micron Technology's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.75 is worse than 69.51% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Micron Technology at 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Story continuesIs Micron Technology Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation AnalysisProfitability and Growth of Micron TechnologyInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Micron Technology has been profitable 9 years over the past 10 years. However, its operating margin of -14.09% is worse than 82.96% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. Despite this, GuruFocus ranks Micron Technology's profitability as strong.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. Micron Technology's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 54.39% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 10.9%, ranking worse than 66.1% of companies in the industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how efficiently a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Micron Technology's ROIC was -5.52, while its WACC came in at 10.42.ConclusionIn conclusion, Micron Technology appears to be significantly overvalued. While the company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong, its growth ranks worse than 66.1% of companies in the Semiconductors industry.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:50% = US$10b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.50.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Parcel Service has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 50% ROEUnited Parcel Service does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.02. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

This is the first time in 12 months that the CPI reflected an increase.Although the rise in July consumer prices was modest, it once again gave the Fed a chance to continue with its interest rate hikes. Inflation declined steadily in 12 months from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 but is still elevated and a lot higher than the Fed’s target rate of 2%.Also, the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.3% month over month in July, higher than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%.

284,0f4a83dd-279d-3a24-841b-3e61c9bdc91f,MLM,2023-08-17,Add 5 Low-Beta Stocks to Your Portfolio to Counter Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-5-low-beta-stocks-120600582.html,1692187560,STORY,"['ACGL', 'ERIE', 'DPUKY', 'AZPN', 'MLM']","[Volatility has returned on Wall Street since the beginning of August after an impressive rally in the first seven months of 2023. Several gloomy pictures across the world have dented market participants’ confidence in risky assets like equities. Although the long-term trend is still bullish, investors should prepare for short-term fluctuations to protect their portfolios.U.S. Banks Under Rating WatchOn Aug 15, Fitch Ratings warned that it may downgrade ratings of more than a dozen U.S. heavyweight banks in the near future. The rating agency already cut its assessment of the U.S. banking sector in June.Fitch said that another one-notch downgrade of the banking sector’s rating from AA- to A+ will compel the rating agency to reevaluate the ratings of all 70 U.S, banks that it covers for possible downgrade.On Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.Global ConcernsChina, the second-largest economy of the world, the facing serious challenges as it is still to recover from the aftershock of COVID-19. The country’s industrial production and retail sales grew less than expected in June.China is facing deflation and its prosperous real estate sector is on the verge of collapse. In order to generate growth and gain investors’ confidence, the People’s Bank of China lowered interest rates by 15 basis points to 2.5% from 2.65%. However, it has failed to deliver so far.On the other hand, Russia’s central bank sharply hiked the benchmark interest rate to 12% from 8.5% The move is aimed to restore the exchange value of its currency rubble from a steady decline. The central bank said that it may hike interest rate further in the near future.On Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years. In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation on the negative watchlist. Story continuesUncertainty on Fed’s Future MoveOn Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. The central bank reinitiated the rate hike regime as the inflation rate remained elevated at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate.Despite a steady decline in the consumer price index, the producer price index (PPI) increased 0.3% month-over-month in July, higher-than-the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core PPI (excluding volatile food, energy, and trade services) increased 0.2% month-over-month in July, marking its highest increase since February. The labor market remains resilient and the average wage rate increased in July. Retail sales in July increased 0.7% month-over-month, marking the best monthly performance since January. Core retail sales (excluding auto sales) in July increased 1% month-over-month, beating the consensus estimate of 0.4%, marking the best month since January.The central bank remains open to more rate hikes, depending on economic data. A resilient labor market and solid consumer spending may compel the Fed to go for more rate hike.Our Top PicksAt this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses.We have narrowed our search to five low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks. These companies have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.

285,ca09827f-580b-3583-8ec2-725d253e4ab4,NTAP,2023-08-17,Earnings Preview: NetApp (NTAP) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-netapp-ntap-q1-140009990.html,1692194409,STORY,['NTAP'],"[The market expects NetApp (NTAP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10%.Revenues are expected to be $1.41 billion, down 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NetApp?For NetApp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NetApp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NetApp would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.54, delivering a surprise of +14.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NetApp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The outperformance primarily reflects lower-than-expected operating expenses.However, SO’s bottom line was lower than the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $1.07 per share, affected by tepid demand on the back of unfavorable weather, to go with the negative effects of rates, usage and pricing changes.The utility reported revenues of $5.7 billion.

Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the second quarter and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian?Story continuesBrian C. CornellThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our team and our business model showed remarkable resilience in the face of multiple headwinds in the external environment. While these headwinds have led to a temporary slowdown in the pace of our business, that doesn't mean our team is standing still. Throughout the company, our team remains focused on staying agile and flexible as we continue to serve our guests and to listen carefully to them in this very dynamic environment. And we're fortunate to have a business model that's inherently flexible by design. We offer a balanced multi-category assortment that's focused on our guests' wants and needs, allowing us to stay relevant in any environment and to quickly pivot as our guest priorities change. And our unique stores as hubs model, a concept we pioneered in the retail industry, allows us to serve our guests quickly, flexibly and reliably on every shopping journey, whether it takes place in a store or on a digital device. By continuously listening to, learning from and engaging with our guests and then refining our playbook with their insights, we'll continue to achieve our purpose of delivering everyday joy for all the families we serve while reinforcing our strong culture of caring, growing and winning together. As you'll recall, in the first half of 2022, we were faced with excess inventory, driven by a rapid change in consumer spending patterns. In the face of that challenge, the team took important steps a year ago, allowing us to quickly adjust our inventory down to the proper level. Those critical decisions have allowed our team to operate efficiently while focusing on serving our guests. They've enabled the presentation of fresh, seasonally appropriate assortments throughout the year and provided the flexibility to lean into share opportunities in key seasons, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. And importantly, last year's inventory actions laid the groundwork for the recovery in profitability we've achieved so far this year. Our team also played a critical role in our second quarter profit performance. As we began to see softening sales trends early in the quarter, the team in our stores and supply chain responded with speed and agility. Their discipline, along with ongoing efficiency efforts, allowed our profit performance to exceed our original expectations despite a meaningful shortfall on the top line. More specifically, for the quarter just ended, operating income expanded by more than $800 million compared with a year ago. And despite the fact we've experienced more than a percentage point of cumulative profit pressure from higher shrink since 2019, our EPS of $3.86 through the first half of the year is more than 50% higher than in 2019. While this is encouraging progress, we are confident we'll see further meaningful increases in our profitability over time. On the top line, Q2 results were below our expectations as comparable sales decreased 5.4%. Within the quarter, comp trends softened from the second half of May into June, before we saw a meaningful recovery in both traffic and comps in July. In the month, we were especially pleased with trends around Independence Day holiday, along with Circle Week, which also resulted in the addition of more than 0.5 million new Target Circle members. Consistent with recent industry trends, second quarter comps reflected continued growth in our frequency categories, offset by notable software results in our more discretionary categories. Across channels, sales were strongest in our stores, while results in our digital channel were led by continued growth in our Drive-Up service. Consistent with our stores as hubs strategy, more than 97% of our second quarter sales were fulfilled by our stores. As we've described for more than a year now, the divergence of sales trends between our frequency and discretionary categories is being driven by multiple cross currents that are affecting the U.S. consumer. These include the impact of inflation in frequency categories, like Food &amp; Beverage and Essentials, causing these categories to absorb a much-higher portion of consumers' budgets. In addition, consumers are choosing to increase spending on services, like leisure travel, entertainment and food away from home, putting near-term pressure on discretionary products. And finally, the rollback of government efforts to support consumers during the pandemic, including stimulus payments, enhanced child care tax credits and the suspension of student loan payments, presents an ongoing headwind that consumers continue to manage. Beyond these factors in the second quarter, many of our store team members faced a negative guest reaction to our Pride assortment. As you know, we have featured a Pride assortment for more than a decade. However, after the launch of the assortment this year, members of our team began experiencing threats and aggressive actions that affected their sense of safety and well being while at work. I want to make it clear: We denounce violence and hate of all kinds, and the safety our team and our guests is our top priority. So to protect the team in the face of these threatening circumstances, we quickly made changes, including the removal of items that were at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior. Pride is one of many heritage moments that are important to our guests and our team, and we'll continue to support these moments in the future. They are just one part of our commitment to support a diverse team, which helps us serve a diverse set of guests. And as we talk to these guests, they consistently tell us that Target is their happy place, somewhere they can go to escape and recharge. So as we navigate an ever-changing operating and social environment, we're committed to staying close to our guests and their expectations of Target. Specific to Pride and Heritage months, we're focused on building assortments that are celebratory and joyous with wide-ranging relevance, being mindful of timing, placement and presentation, leaning into segmentation and leveraging our digital experience and reconsidering the mix of owned brands, national brands and external partners within these assortments. Our goal is to ensure we continue to celebrate moments that are special to our guests while acknowledging that, every day, for millions of people, they want Target to serve as a refuge in their daily lives. In addition to these more recent challenges, our team continues to face an unacceptable amount of retail theft and organized retail crime. As you'll hear in more detail from Michael, shrink in the second quarter remained consistent with our expectations, but well above the sustainable level where we expect to operate over time. And unfortunately, safety incidents associated with theft are moving in the wrong direction. During the first 5 months of this year, our stores saw a 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence. As a result, we're continuing to work tirelessly with retail industry groups and community partners to find solutions to promote safety for our store teams and our guests. Looking ahead, as you'll hear from both Christina and John, our team is focused on moving forward and preparing for the biggest seasons of the year. And given the current consumer and economic backdrop, we've adjusted our guidance for the remainder of the year, consistent with a cautious planning approach that has served us so well during the first half of the year. Against this cautious backdrop, our team is laser-focused on delivering newness, quality and affordability, reinforced by a commitment to retail fundamentals. Given the rapid growth and the volatility our business has experienced over the last several years, we have an opportunity to refocus our team on 4 key factors that determine where consumers choose to shop: Being reliably in stock; highlighting affordability throughout our assortment, presentation and marketing; leveraging the proximity of our stores to the guests we serve; while ensuring a seamless differentiated, easy and inspiring guest experience on every trip, every day. These areas have always been a source of strength, and we want to ensure we continue to differentiate our experience from our competitors. Within our merchandising, we'll continue to invest in our industry-leading owned brand portfolio, along with the expansion of key national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Levis, Apple and Disney. We'll focus on deepening the relationship with over 100 million Target Circle members and leveraging the power of our Roundel ad business to integrate relevant offers and promotions throughout the fall. And we'll continue to drive awareness of our industry-leading Drive-Up service and highlight the recent addition of new guest-focused options, including Drive-Up returns and the ability to have a Starbuck beverage delivered with your order. Of course, we'll also continue to invest in our physical assets to position us for continued future growth. But the bulk of these investments are happening in our stores as we add new locations, complete full store remodels, enhance the efficiency of our same-day services and add new locations for our Ulta Beauty partnership, Disney store concept or enhanced Apple experience. In the supply chain, we're continuing to invest in upstream replenishment capabilities, along with the expansion of our network of sortation centers, which deliver meaningful savings while increasing the speed of our last-mile delivery. So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take stock of where our business is today. And I think it's helpful to pull back the lens because 2023 is the fourth year in a row in which the external backdrop has been far different from anything we've ever experienced. Yet today, as a result of our team's consistent efforts to listen, understand and serve our guests, Target is a much different company than it was 4 years ago. We have the right strategy, guest relevance and team to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Through the first half of 2023, our total revenue of just over $50 billion was about 39% higher than the $36 billion we delivered in 2019. This growth reflects significant increases across our entire business in all 5 merchandising categories in both our stores and digital channels and in our Roundel ad business. And this growth reflects an increase in guest engagement, as measured by the number of visits they're making to Target. And today, despite the challenges we faced in recent quarters, the number of guest trips through the first half of 2023 was more than 169 million higher or more than 21% higher than in 2019. Our team delivered this growth during a time of exceptional uncertainty and volatility. I want to end my remarks by acknowledging that accomplishment. And I also want to recognize the team members in our stores and distribution centers for the way they quickly responded to the recent and unexpected slowdown in our top line sales trends. It's because of their discipline and agility that we've continued to provide an outstanding shopping experience while delivering better-than-expected profitability so far this year. On behalf of all our stakeholders, I want to thank our entire team for their continued extraordinary efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Christina.A. Christina HenningtonThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the multiple headwinds we were faced on the top line, there were a number of things to like in the second quarter. Of the many notable bright spots, our team's agile execution in service of our guests and each other rises to the top. Consumers continue to face difficult choices with every purchase. Whether managing their budgets in the face of higher prices or planning for resuming student loan payments, our guests are facing multiple ongoing challenges. With inflation rates moderating, however, we've started to see consumer confidence begin to recover from recent lows. And while we're maintaining an appropriately cautious outlook today, we're hopeful that conditions can improve with time. In the meantime, even as consumers continue to spend with caution, our guests continue to embrace newness and seasonally relevant moments, all with an unwavering focus on affordability. In the second quarter, comparable sales were down 5.4%, softer than our expectations coming into the quarter. Frequency categories continue to grow, partially offsetting the softness we saw in discretionary categories. Essentials &amp; Beauty grew in the mid-single digits, led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the low double digits. Within our Beauty offering, core Beauty delivered double-digit growth while sales from Ulta Beauty at Target more than doubled compared with a year ago, showing why we're so enthusiastic about this exclusive partnership. Food &amp; Beverage sales were in the low single digits, and we saw particular strength in snacks, candy and beverages. Conversely, discretionary categories softened further from recent trends, with Apparel, Home and Hardlines all seeing comp declines in the low double digits to mid-teens in the second quarter, several percentage points softer than in the first quarter. Even as trends in these categories remain quite soft overall, there are pockets of newness that are working quite well, and we're doubling down on investments in those areas. For example, our Entertainment business within Hardlines continues to see healthy growth in the mid-single digits, driven by newness in books and renewed growth in vinyl records. With that in mind and knowing how our guests can't get enough of Taylor Swift, we proactively secured an exclusive vinyl offering that Swifties bought in droves. Additionally, in Home, we've seen incredible demand for Stanley tumblers and cups. So we worked in partnership with Chip and Joanna Gaines to add exclusive new colors to the line as part of our beloved owned brand, Hearth &amp; Hand, found only at Target. As you heard from Brian, we anticipated some of the headwinds at play throughout the second quarter. including the continued pullback in discretionary spending. Other headwinds were incremental, including the strong reaction to this year's Pride assortment. Our goal is for our assortment to resonate broadly and deliver on the Target brand promise. In this case, the reaction is a signal for us to pause, adapt and learn so that our future approach to these moments balances celebration, inclusivity and broad-based appeal. As we move ahead, we're confident that if we stay close to our guests, consistently execute on our retail fundamentals and continue investing in our assortments, services and experiences, we will position Target for continued growth over the long term. After all, as a guest-led company, we have been listening to and learning from our guests for decades. As an example, last year, we heard loud and clear that Target Circle members love exclusive events. So we repurposed last year's Deal Days and made our Target Circle Week in July bigger than ever with incremental promotions and new ways to engage. In fact, we enrolled well over 0.5 million new guests during this event alone, more than 3.5x higher than in an average week. Additionally, Beauty guests told us for years how they would love the convenience of completing their beauty trip with access to prestige beauty products while shopping at Target. This led to the development of a unique partnership with Ulta Beauty to meet those needs. And today, based on the strong results we've seen so far, we continue to expand the footprint of these new shop-in-shops. When our guests, who already love our Drive-Up service, told us that they wanted us to add Starbucks and the ability to make returns, we quickly built, piloted and are now rolling out those capabilities across the chain, and we're seeing incredibly high Net Promoter Scores from our guests. And well before the recent release of the long-awaited Barbie Movie, we collaborated with our vendor partners to secure exclusive items across multiple categories while adding a splash of pink style for Barbie fans of all ages. Barbie, along with Disney's The Little Mermaid, are the most recent examples of our long record of success in securing timely, relevant product lines supporting key movie licenses across toys, apparel, home, beauty and food, which have allowed us to consistently capture between 30% and 60% market share with these properties. While we continue to take a conservative inventory position overall, these examples show that we are still leaning into key opportunities. We know our guests want to celebrate culturally and seasonally relevant moments, and we'll be leaning into those moments in a big way in the third quarter and the upcoming holiday season. And our guests have told us that affordability; availability; and easy, convenient and consistently joyful shopping experience are more important than ever. While I've shared in prior calls that we're always focused on retail fundamentals, we're further sharpening our focus on 4 key aspects: Comprehensive affordability, in-stock levels, leveraging our proximity to our guests and the overall shopping experience. For a great example look no further than our Back-to-School and Back-to-College assortments. We know our guests are approaching Back-to-School with a value-conscious, deal-driven mindset, so we're leaning into savings for teachers and college students, including our 20% off Teachers Appreciation and Student Savings events. We're also featuring ultra low everyday prices all season long, with school supplies starting as low as $0.25, and key items such as lunch boxes and graphic tees at compelling $5 price points. And just in time for Back-to-School, we're launching new Good &amp; Gather products, including an assortment of new lunchbox-sized items. Back-to-College is always a big season for Target. This year, we're leaning into affordability as well as proximity to college-bound students. This includes strategic inventory bets and allocations in key markets where there are the greatest market share opportunities to ensure we're in stock and ready to play offense during this critical season. Of course, affordability goes well beyond a single season like Back-to-School. In fact, with many consumers making their decisions on where to shop based on affordability, we're highlighting the comprehensive value we provide through our $30-plus billion owned brand portfolio. For example, Threshold, our flagship owned brand in Home, just received a major facelift. With new branding, stronger price points and a clarified aesthetic to help guests mix and match affordable styles for their homes, this beloved brand will be even easier to love. And just in time for the holidays, we'll be launching new owned brands while expanding others, including the launch of a new kitchenware line that will make everyday meal prep easier while offering incredible quality and durability. Look for lots of newness on store shelves and online later this Fall. As John will cover in more detail, we continue to invest heavily in our in-store experience, which starts with new stores and remodels that incorporate our latest and greatest offerings, including Apple, Levi's and Disney experiences, as well as the additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. And just like we remodel our stores to reflect our latest thinking and guest feedback into the shopping experience, we'll begin rolling out a remodel of our digital experience this quarter. Based on guest feedback, we're investing to create a digital experience that enhances the love of discovery while balancing the ease of navigation. This will include different landing experiences, more personalized content, enhanced search functionality, ease of navigation and other updates to bring more joy and convenience to our digital guests. Through it all, our teams continue to exhibit a commitment to excellence in the pursuit of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. Regardless of the external environment, our team consistently shows up and rises to the moment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside such a talented team. Thank you for all you do to bring that Target magic to life day in and day out. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.John J. MulliganThanks, Christina. Like Brian and Christina, I want to start by thanking our amazing team. This quarter's better-than-expected profitability was a testament to their agility and resilience as they successfully managed through multiple challenges. And while the team deserves credit for this performance, they got an assist from this year's leaner inventory position which offered more room to maneuver than a year ago when the team was dealing with excess inventory. This year, with unclouded facilities, a renewed focus on retail fundamentals and our continued work to enhance efficiency, the team delivered an impressive increase in profitability in the face of a challenging top line. Across the entire supply chain, we're benefiting from much more favorable conditions than a year ago. Perhaps most notable is in global shipping, where second quarter import lead times were nearly 30 days shorter than last year and within a couple of days of pre-pandemic levels. In our domestic supply chain, because of strong partnership with our vendors, we're seeing improvement on multiple performance metrics, including fill rates and on-time arrivals. And at our regional distribution centers, inbound backlogs have been reduced by more than a day since last year.In the new flow centers we've opened over the last couple of years, we're also seeing improvements across multiple performance metrics as these new buildings continue to scale up towards capacity. In support of their primary role in replenishing store inventory, these facilities were designed and equipped to support our stores as hubs strategy with newly developed automation that can assemble customized, presorted and sequence shipments for every store they serve. With these shipments, stores see faster replenishment times, require less labor to unload a trailer and maintain lower levels of backroom inventory. More precisely, stores being serviced by these new facilities have seen a 20% reduction in lead times, enabling them to respond more quickly to changes in guest demand. Also notable, stores serviced by these new facilities are benefiting from improvements in in-stock levels while maintaining lower levels of backroom inventory.Beyond store replenishment, we're operating these new flow centers in a way that's unique within the industry. In the same way we pioneered ways to leverage the proximity, inventory and assets in our stores to quickly and efficiently fulfill digital orders, we're leveraging those same characteristics of our flow centers to fulfill certain digital orders beyond their primary role in replenishing store inventories.In light of our focus on retail fundamentals throughout the supply chain, our stores are seeing meaningful improvements in their in-stocks, even with 17% lower inventory on our balance sheet than a year ago. In the second quarter, overall in-stocks were a full percentage point better than first quarter and more than 2 points better than last year. We've seen even bigger improvements on our top items and in our top stores. And this year, we sat with meaningfully better in-stocks on key seasonal programs, including Back-to-School and Back-to-College, than we saw a year ago.Our new sortation centers are delivering outstanding results. These facilities operate downstream from our stores and help to increase the speed and efficiency of last-mile delivery. Up to 70% of the packages processed by these facilities stay in the local market, allowing us to partner with Shipt to handle the last mile. This integration with Shipt allows us to achieve meaningful efficiency and cost savings while offering much greater speed of delivery to our guests.More specifically, in markets where we operate a sortation center, the average click-to-deliver time is nearly 1.5 days shorter than the network average, with about 1/3 of the packages arriving in only 1 day. As we continue to open new buildings and test and iterate on their operating model, we expect these speed metrics will continue to improve in the future.Today, based on the proven success of this strategy, we have 10 sortation centers already operating and expect to open at least 6 more over the next few years. This current group of sortation centers is expected to process more than 35 million packages in 2023, representing a more than 20% increase from a year ago and a more than sixfold increase from 2021. As I described in our call 3 months ago, store teams this year have been focused on reinforcing best practices that support the retail fundamentals Christina highlighted earlier. In particular, this year, we've been investing to provide incremental training and reporting on several key factors that play a critical role in providing a great shopping experience, including staffing and scheduling; setting, filling and replenishing merchandise presentations; and protecting the safety of our guests and our team. Throughout this year, our store teams have been progressing through a strategically sequenced training program designed to reinforce these best practices at key moments, like Back-to-School and Back-to-College. The goal is to provide an elevated, consistent experience every day in every store across the country. Since we've rolled out this training, we've seen broad-based improvement on performance metrics tied to critical guest outcomes, including pricing accuracy, locating items for digital orders and setting key seasonal programs more quickly and completely. And in support of the goal of achieving greater consistency in the level of execution across our nearly 2,000 stores, we've implemented a new rapid response process to help individual locations recover more quickly when they begin to see a decline in key metrics. Also in stores, as Christina mentioned, we are really pleased with the early results from nationwide rollout of Drive-Up returns and the ability to add a Starbucks order to a Drive-Up trip. We've long said that Drive-Up receives the highest satisfaction rating of any service we provide. And as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we continually push ourselves to find new ways to further differentiate Drive-Up. And when we ask our guests how we could do that, they told us that adding Starbucks and taking returns were at the top of their list.To ensure that we could consistently execute on these new services while maintaining the high bar we've attained for satisfaction, we applied a disciplined test-and-iterate approach to the rollout, beginning with small-scale tests in the second half of 2022. Following a successful test of Drive-Up returns, we launched the service nationwide in April and May, and the results have been outstanding. Once a guest arrives at a Drive-Up lane, the average wait time for a team member to process their return is within 3 minutes, consistent with our standards for a traditional Drive-Up order. As we began testing the addition of Starbucks to Drive-Up, and given the complexities of making and promptly delivering a hot or cold beverage after our guest arrives, we wanted to put the process through an intensive period of testing and refinement. And today, based on what we've learned during the test period, we're confident we can scale up this service while consistently maintaining our service standards. As a result, we're currently in the process of rolling out Starbucks at Drive-Up nationwide and plan to complete the rollout by the end of October, just in time for pumpkin spice latte season.So now before I finish my remarks, I want to provide a brief update on this year's new store openings. As you know, we plan to open about 20 new locations this year, ranging in size from 20,000 to 137,000 square feet. In the second quarter, we completed and opened another 5 new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 11.Highlight of our second quarter projects was the opening of our first new offshore location since 2021, a new store in the Oahu Windward Mall, bringing our store count in Hawaii up to 9. At 132,000 square feet and featuring a Starbucks, Ulta Beauty, CVS, Snack Bar and 18 Drive-Up stalls, this is one of the largest stores we'll open in 2023. And I'm happy to say that it had one of the strongest openings of the year, reflecting outstanding execution by our team. Like our other stores in Hawaii, this new location is expected to be one of the most productive in the chain. And during its first week, it generated the second-highest sales volume out of the most recent 175 stores we've opened.I also want to pause and acknowledge the devastating wildfires that hit Maui in Hawaii. Thankfully, members of our team there are safe, though some have lost homes, had to evacuate or are providing shelter for family and friends. Our nearby stores remain open, helping guests to get much-needed essentials while donating masks and other emergency supplies. In addition, Target has announced a $1 million donation to help national and local disaster partners, and our team member giving fund is collecting donations from team members across the country to help their colleagues impacted by these wildfires.So as I turn the call over to Michael, I want to end with where I started and highlight the tireless efforts of the best team in retail. The last 4 years have been anything but business as usual, and through it all, our team has consistently maintained their focus on what matters most: Taking care of our guests and taking care of each other. I couldn't be more proud to work alongside them and learn from them every day.That, I'll turn it over to Michael.Michael J. FiddelkeThanks, John. As John just mentioned, our team and operating model continue to navigate through a host of challenges on the top line, but our business is showing its resilience. More specifically, we're really pleased with the strength of our second quarter profit performance, which further validates the cautious planning approach and lean inventory position we've maintained throughout the year. This positioning, combined with our continued efficiency efforts, allowed us to make meaningful progress toward our profit recovery goals even in the face of softer-than-expected sales, giving us further confidence that our strategy is sound, we have the right team and our business is positioned for continued progress in the years ahead.Total revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter. Total sales also decreased by that same amount while other revenue grew 1.3%. Within other revenue, we continue to see strong growth from our Roundel ad business, which offset declines in credit card profit sharing and other small income items compared with last year. Comparable sales were down 5.4% in Q2, reflecting a 4.8% decline in traffic. Among the factors affecting our top line performance, comps and discretionary categories continue to reflect challenging trends in the industry, which softened further in Q2. A second factor was lower inflation in food, beverages and essentials as we compare to over peak inflation a year ago. Furthermore, traffic and top line trends were affected by the reaction to our Pride assortment, which launched in the middle of May. And lastly, our results reflected the comparison over last year's clearance and promotional activity, which affected weekly comp trends in certain categories, particularly in the digital channel. While each of these factors played a role in the quarter, it's not possible to reliably quantify the separate impact of each one.In terms of the monthly cadence in Q2, comp sales in May were down a little more than 3%, moved down to a decline of just over 7% in June, then made an encouraging recovery to minus 5% in July. Monthly traffic followed a similar cadence and actually recovered a bit faster than sales in July. Even with unexpectedly soft sales, inventories remain very well controlled. At the end of the second quarter, balance sheet inventory was 17% lower than a year ago. This reflects our cautious planning approach, the agility of our team in responding to softer sales trends and the benefit of a faster global supply chain which enabled shorter lead times. Among our merchandising categories, discretionary inventory was down 25% at the end of Q2, partially offset by increases in our frequency categories and strategic investments and long-term share opportunities. Importantly, as John mentioned, even with much leaner inventories, we've seen meaningful in-stock improvements across our network. We were really pleased with our second quarter gross margin performance, which was enabled by our ongoing work to navigate this volatile environment. Our Q2 gross margin rate of 27% was 5.5 percentage points higher than a year ago. This increase reflects multiple benefits within merchandising, including lower markdowns and other inventory-related costs, along with the benefit of lower freight and transportation costs.Beyond merchandising, we also saw about 0.5 point of benefit in digital fulfillment and supply chain due to a lower mix of digital sales and a favorable mix of same-day services within the digital channel. Offsetting these benefits was a 90 basis point headwind from inventory shrink, in line with our expectations.One note. Consistent with the first quarter, category mix did not affect our gross margin rate compared with last year, and we saw a similar deceleration across all 5 of our core merchandising categories between Q1 and Q2 of this year.Our second quarter SG&amp;A expense rate was 1.7 percentage points higher than last year. This increase reflects the deleveraging impact of lower sales, combined with the impact of higher costs, including continued investments in paying benefits for our team and inflationary pressures throughout our business. These pressures were partially offset by disciplined cost management across our team.On the D&amp;A expense line. The Q2 rate was about 20 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales on a 3.9% increase in dollars. Altogether, our Q2 operating margin rate of 4.8% was about 4x higher than last year, reflecting a meaningful recovery from last year's inventory actions. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS of $1.80 was significantly higher than last year and above the high end of our guidance range. While we expected to see a big improvement in profitability this quarter, I can't emphasize enough the importance of our team's agility in delivering this performance, something that's even more notable given that shrink drove nearly a full point of profit pressure versus last year.Now I want to turn briefly to capital deployment and start with our priorities, which have served us well for decades. First, we fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on more than 50 years of consecutive annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash through share repurchase over time within the limits of our Middle A credit ratings. So far this year, we've made capital expenditures of $2.8 billion and continue to expect full year CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. In the second quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends compared with $417 million last year, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend. And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in Q2 as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our Middle A credit ratings. And we're encouraged by the progress we've already made, as the combined benefit of a significant profit recovery and lean inventory position have driven a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated $3.4 billion in cash through the first half of this year compared with a slightly negative number through the first half of last year. I'll end my comments on the quarter with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures our current profit performance in the context of our long-term investments. For the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 13.7%. While still healthy in absolute terms and more than 2 percentage points higher than the first quarter, it remains well below the level where we expect to operate over time. Now I'll turn to our expectations for Q3 and the remainder of the year. And today, as we assess the economic and industry backdrop, we continue to see a mixed picture. On the positive side, GDP, employment and overall consumer spending have been resilient, and we're beginning to see a recovery in consumer confidence. On the other side of the ledger, while we're happy to see inflation rates begin to moderate, that's likely to cause some near-term pressure on dollar comps in our frequency categories. In addition, the upcoming resumption of student loan repayments will put additional pressure on the already strained budgets of tens of millions of households. Against this backdrop, we remain cautious in our planning, an approach that has served us really well so far this year. On the top line, we're now planning for comparable sales in a wide range centered around a mid-single-digit decline for the remainder of the year, consistent with what we experienced in July and the second quarter overall. This updated sales expectation is meaningfully softer than our expectation at the beginning of the year. With this change in the top line, we've also adjusted our bottom line guidance and now expect full year GAAP and adjusted EPS in the $7 to $8 range compared with our prior range of $7.75 to $8.75. While multiple factors will determine where our actual results wind up in comparison to this expected range, the single most important variable will be the pace of our sales as we're confident we'll continue to benefit from our efficiency efforts and lean inventory position. In the third quarter, we're expecting GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.20 to $1.60 on a wide range of comparable sales centered around a mid-single-digit decline. In terms of quarterly EPS cadence, I want to take note of a couple of unique circumstances this year. The first is shrink and how that is expected to play out over the next 2 quarters. As I mentioned earlier, based on the high loss rates we're continuing to see, second quarter shrink was consistent with our expectations, and our full year shrink expectations remain unchanged. However, we expect the year-over-year comparisons will look meaningfully different between Q3 and Q4. In Q3, we expect the dollar and rate pressure from shrink will be roughly consistent with the first half of the year at around 90 basis points. However, in Q4, we expect to see a small amount of year-over-year favorability from shrink. I want to stress that this anticipated change in quarterly comparisons does not reflect an expectation that underlying loss rates will begin to improve in Q4. As Brian mentioned, we're working hard, both inside our stores and with government and community partners, to achieve lower loss rates over time. And our long-run expectation is that shrink rates will moderate from today's unsustainable levels. But so far, we've only seen indications that loss rates might soon be reaching a plateau, but have not yet seen evidence that loss rates will begin to come down. So the only reason for the expected change in year-over-year comparisons is the cadence of how shrink was recognized by quarter in the back half of last year, a period when loss rates increased rapidly, resulting in higher shrink accruals at year-end. Because we've seen more consistent loss rates in 2023, quarterly accruals have been more consistent throughout this year. Another important consideration is that 2023 is a 53-week accounting year, so the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that the extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and results in about 30 basis points of operating margin leverage on the quarter. I'll note that the extra week will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length. As I get ready to end my remarks, I want to add my thanks to the entire Target team. From the flexibility they built into our business plans, to their responsiveness in the face of this quarter's top line volatility, and their continued work to enhance our long-term efficiency, they're clearly demonstrating their amazing resilience and showing why we're confident that we work with the best team in retail. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.Brian C. CornellBefore we turn to your questions, I want to pause and reinforce why we're so confident in our long-term prospects, which position us for profitable growth in the years ahead. Retail is an ongoing journey: The continuous process of listening to consumers and rapidly evolving to meet their preferences. To do that well, you need to have the right assets in place which allow you to quickly evolve as your guests' wants, needs and preferences change. And we're proud of the way we have built and strengthened Target's assets over the last decade. During this time, we pioneered and built a unique stores as hubs model and invested in new supply chain capabilities to support that model. We invested billions of dollars in our existing store base, modernizing their shopping experience while optimizing those facilities to support digital fulfillment. We opened new locations in markets that had never been served by a Target store, and we continue to evolve our new store design. We developed and launched industry-leading same-day services, which received some of the highest guest satisfaction ratings of anything we do. Within our assortment, we innovated to make our Food and Beauty businesses even stronger and gained huge amounts of market share along the way. We built an even stronger portfolio of industry-leading owned brands which today generate more than $30 billion in annual sales. We also strengthened our portfolio of national brand partners with Ulta Beauty as the most recent example. At the same time, we developed and launched our Roundel ad business, which leverages the power of our guest base and vendor relationships, to deepen the bond between our guests, our vendors at Target. We also built and launched Target Circle, which has quickly become one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States, providing us with even deeper insights about our guests and how we can serve them. And finally, we invested in our team, the best team in retail, by rapidly increasing their hourly wages and the benefits we provide while building stronger pathways to career development and advancement and designing operational processes to enhance their safety and job satisfaction. With all of these assets in place today, we're not standing still. We're uniquely prepared to navigate into the future, including any uncertainties we'll face. We're committed to carefully listening to our guests and to our team and continuing to invest in capabilities and assets that will best serve our guests, even as their wants and needs and expectations evolve from where they are today. Since no one knows what the future will bring and when new opportunities and challenges will arise, the company's best position to thrive over time are the ones with the tools to adapt. And with our stores, our brands, and our vendor partners, our capabilities and our great team, we have everything we need to deliver long-term growth and success. With that, we'll turn to Q&amp;A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you guys are seeing quarter-to-date. And then if you have any initial reads on what you're seeing with the Back-to-School season.Brian C. CornellMichael, I'm happy to start. Rupesh, obviously, it's very early in the season. But for the first 10 days of August, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. They were very consistent with what we saw in the month of July as guests turn to Target for their Back-to-School and Back-to-College shopping.Michael J. FiddelkeYes. I don't have much to add to that. We knew the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons would be important for us. They always are. Second-biggest seasonal moment for us only next to the holiday season. And it was a season where we expected to have some share opportunities. So like Brian said, 10 days in, so just getting started with the quarter, but we're pleased with what we see so far. And the exciting thing about the balance of the year is we've got a lot of those seasonal moments to come. And we know our business performs so well across all categories in those seasonal moments.Brian C. CornellMichael, the only thing I would add as we think about Back-to-School, and particularly Back-to-College, is we expect the shopping season to extend into September, in fact, throughout the month of September. So we're off to a solid start, it's still very early. But we think this will be a Back-to-School season that extends into September.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhGreat. And then maybe one follow-up question. So at your Analyst Day, you indicated expectations for achieving a 6% operating margin rate as early as FY '24. Just given that weaker top line, is that still in the realm of possibility, of getting up to 6% in your next fiscal year?Michael J. FiddelkeFair question, Rupesh, and one I'm sure we'll come back to over time. Right now, we're laser-focused on delivering a strong back half of the year. We're pleased with the profit recovery we saw in the second quarter. When we headed into this year, the path to 6% was paved with meaningful profit rate improvement in 2023. And I couldn't be more thrilled with the progress the teams are making towards that, as evidenced by the strong profit performance in Q2. And we'll continue to plan cautiously and set the team up for as much agility as possible in the back half of the year. And I would expect that progression on profit to continue through the balance of this year, but more to come at the right time on what we think that long-term trajectory looks like.OperatorOur next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWe wondered if you could talk through gross margins maybe a little bit more. We were curious about how much more markdowns were versus plan given the softness on the discretionary side and some of the merchandising challenges. And what was the offset -- the meaningful offset there?Michael J. FiddelkeYes. Kate, I'm happy to start and welcome, Christina, if you want to add any more color. But the biggest story on the markdown front. I mean, I think we described the promotional environment is rational and really as expected for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, clearly, as you know, Kate, we saw meaningful improvement from last year's excess markdowns and cost to clear inventory. And so as you think about the 5-plus point improvement in margin rate year-over-year, the vast majority of that improvement comes from being cleaner from an inventory respective and saving those costs from last year. And so again, just one more example of, by planning the business cautiously, by positioning with flexibility, and by the team reacting to some of the sales trends we saw in the quarter with urgency, we've been able to keep inventory really clean. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll see as clean of an inventory picture exiting the quarter as we started with, with inventories down 17% in total, down 25% in the discretionary categories. So we feel well managed on the inventory front, and that's showing up with markdowns playing out as expected.A. Christina HenningtonYes, Michael. I wouldn't have a lot to add. We're pleased with the team's agility and we believe that the environment is rational, and we're continuing to build back our profit in light of the circumstances.Katharine Amanda McShaneAnd a follow-up question comes on the heels, I think, of the first question that was asked. But wanted to get a little bit more detail about any changes in consumer behavior within the discretionary categories, especially as traffic got better into July? And just how you're thinking of the discretionary categories in the back half of the year.Brian C. CornellYes. Kate, I think we've continued to see the same trends over really the last year now. Well, I think we see a very resilient U.S. consumer, and I think so much of that is fueled by the strength in the labor market. We continue to see a consumer who is facing high inflationary pressure in Food &amp; Beverage and Essential categories that's absorbing a bigger portion of their wallet. I think as they think about discretionary spending, we've seen a rotation in their wallet from goods into services. You're seeing the uptick in travel and leisure, what's happening in entertainment. So those trends, we expect to continue into the back half of the year. We'll watch it carefully. I think our inventory position allows us the ability to chase into demand, and we'll be ready when we see demand changing as we enter the holiday season. But I think the consumer is still taking a very cautious approach to discretionary spending in the goods sector.OperatorOur next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenRegarding traffic, what's your forecast for traffic that's embedded in guidance? Do you expect it to continue to be in the negative low or negative mid-single-digit range? Also, as we dive a little deeper into the discretionary product assortment, what do you see as opportunities in apparel? And how are you thinking about your overall private label assortment in terms of rebalancing and/or the portfolio relative to non-private label?Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to talk about some of the plans we have in place for the back half of the year, some of the newness we have in our assortment, and some of the exciting new changes we're going to make from an owned brand standpoint?A. Christina HenningtonYes, I'd be happy to. So Oliver, thanks for the question. On the discretionary portfolio, we continue to build our assortment strategy for the long term. We fully believe in our multi-category portfolio, that it offers us an ability to meet the guests' needs in a variety of different times. At the moment, given where the consumer is spending, we're, of course, leading on the strength of our Food &amp; Beverage portfolio and Essentials &amp; Beauty, with Beauty really being a highlight with double-digit growth both in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as our core business. Within discretionary, what we're seeing is that there are things that are very much working around newness and innovation. And as you pointed out, our owned brand portfolio plays a huge role in delivering against those goals. We design, we create, we source, we build assortments that -- where we can control a lot of those elements. And we've introduced a lot of newness whether you think about, even in the last quarter, taking advantage of the hot trend with family tumblers and introducing that and embedding that in Hearth &amp; Hand. We have just relaunched our own brand, Threshold, which is our signature Home brand, with updated aesthetics and great price points and new branding. We continue to lean on opportunities. You'll see us launch a kitchenware brand later this quarter, which we're really excited about for its value, but incredible quality and durability. But beyond those opportunities to introduce innovation, it's really taking advantage of the opportunities where guests can do more in one store at Target, and that happens during those seasonal times, where we can leverage both the strength of Food &amp; Beverage as well as Home or Apparel to complete the trip. And Back-to-School, Back-to-College, as Michael mentioned, is a terrific time for us to showcase the strength of our portfolio. So we'll keep doing what we're doing. We're leaning into different categories, but we're planning appropriately so that we can be responsive in the market.Michael J. FiddelkeAnd Oliver, on traffic, as you know, we don't break out a separate traffic forecast. And so kind of the build that goes into our top line guide is embedded in all the things that underlie it. But a couple of thoughts that, one, I'll just reiterate from my comments. We were pleased with the sequential improvement in July in the quarter, and we saw traffic improve at a slightly faster rate than dollars did as we saw that improvement. And then if you zoom all the way back out, versus 2019, if you look at the first 6 months of this year compared to 2019, I mean, we've got almost well over 20% higher traffic coming to our business than we were pre-pandemic. That translates to 170 million or so more guests interactions with Target in store and online. And so the deeper guest engagement we've built is evidenced by our traffic growth over time, critically important to our prospects going forward.Brian C. CornellI'll try to tie those 2 questions together. During the balance of the year, you'll continue to see us lean into seasonal moments. We know those are very important moments for our guests, those are traffic-driving moments for Target. And to Christina's point, we'll combine great newness with affordability throughout those seasons. If you're in our stores today or looking at target.com, you're seeing us lean into this Back-to-School season with great affordability. We'll continue to do that as we enter the Halloween season, get ready for the holidays, combining that great Target newness with great affordability that meet the needs of our guests. So we'll be cautious as we plan for the back half of the year, but we'll lean into those big seasonal moments where we know the guest expects Target to be there to meet their needs.Oliver ChenBrian, one follow-up. Inclusivity has always been important to Target as well as thinking about stakeholders. What are your thoughts in terms of appealing to the broad array of customers going forward and strategies there, particularly around LGBTQIA+?Brian C. CornellOliver, at the heart of our purpose is our commitment to bring joy to all the families we serve. And that really is all families. So we want to make sure Target is that happy place for all of our guests, a place where they can recharge and enjoy those shopping experiences, and you should expect to see us continue to do that over the years to come.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserThe perception is that Target gained a lot of share over the last few years. And now as its traffic is under pressure, guests are either going elsewhere or Target is losing market share. So what levers can Target pull in order to recapture those who would become disenfranchised or are seeking out value or discretionary goods at other retailers? And how much might it cost to regain those guests that are now shopping elsewhere?Brian C. CornellMichael, I might start by zooming out a bit and kind of looking at our performance over several years. Since the start of the pandemic, we've added over $30 billion of top line growth, a significant increase since 2019. And importantly, that's been driven by an increase in trips and transactions, guests spending more time shopping in our stores. I think the strategy we have in place and have had in place for years will serve us well going forward. We'll continue to make sure we're investing in a great in-store experience. Making sure that we are recommitting to retail fundamentals, which means being in stock every time you shop, providing great affordability, making sure we're leveraging our proximity, providing a great guest experience. That extends into the work we'll do from a fulfillment standpoint. We continue to see our guests turn to Target for same-day services, whether it's Drive-Up or Pick-Up or having something delivered to their home through Shipt. Our owned brand portfolio is now a $30 billion brand portfolio. It's a trusted portfolio of brands that provides great quality and style and affordability. So we'll continue to invest in the strategy that served us so well over the last few years and I believe will continue to serve us well going forward.Michael LasserUnderstood. Our follow-up question is on the operating expense outlook. In light of the traffic declines, presumably, you're adjusting your labor. And on top of that, you're in the midst of harvesting $2 billion to $3 billion of savings over the next couple of years. So can you give us a sense for how your operating dollar growth is going to look in the back half of the year? And are there any onetime factors that are going to benefit your operating expense dollar growth that would not be sustainable moving forward?Michael J. FiddelkeYes, I'm happy to take that one, Michael. I mean, obviously, on the SG&amp;A line, leverage matters. And so the softness we saw in the second quarter showed up in some deleverage on some of those more fixed expenses, especially in an inflationary environment. We still got a fair amount of inflation. And importantly, investments in our team, in wage and benefits on that line as well. But I'll say the team's flexibility in the quarter, not just in SG&amp;A, but across the P&amp;L, was really remarkable. And that starts with well-managed inventories. And we talked about the implications for markdowns on the gross margin line there. But managing inventory well flows across the whole system. I mean, we were heavy last year. That makes us more efficient -- more inefficient in stores when the back rooms are full. It makes us more inefficient in our distribution centers when we're managing a lot of inventory. And so we're seeing the benefits of that cleaner inventories position across the system, and I would expect those benefits to continue. And we've got a team that's really focused on managing costs and expense well in the current environment. And that work on efficiency, to translate the scale gains we've seen over the last few years into a more efficient operation, I would expect that to continue to be fuel in the quarters and years to come on the efficiency front.Brian C. CornellOperator, we have time for one last question today.OperatorOur last question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanI wanted to ask, I don't know the way in which you look at the consumer, whether it's in quintiles or deciles. Can you give us a sense, if you look at the comp that the business is performing, how that spreads across your best customer, your middle customer and then maybe your most occasional customer? And if there's anything we could glean from that and think about how it recovers.Brian C. CornellChristina, do you want to share some of the insights we have about the different guests that are shopping our stores today?A. Christina HenningtonYes. I think, obviously, we've seen the -- as Brian talked about, we've seen a rotation in their wallet. And so the guests that are more engaged with our discretionary businesses are now leaning more on into our frequency businesses. But I would tell you a very compelling proof point that came out of the second quarter is how we performed during Target Circle Week. Target Circle Week was Target's opportunity to demonstrate value and give back value to our most loyal customers. This was a shift from prior years, where we did Target Deal Days, and the guests really responded to our actions. In fact, it was our single-largest Target Circle Week ever. We acquired an incremental 500,000-plus guests, which is more than 3.5x the average weeks' acquisition rate, into that loyalty program. A loyalty program, by the way, that already has 100 million members. And so the depth to which we're relating to our guests is going to continue to be fueled by our ability to understand them and serve them uniquely, and Target Circle is one way that we're going to do that.Simeon Ari GutmanAnd then the follow-up, maybe for Michael. If you look at the margin recovery of the business that could happen over, call it, the next year or so, is there anything that stands in the way of it? Meaning if we see comps recover and bounce back, especially that means your signature categories recover, is there any reason why we shouldn't see margins continue along that path? I know you said we'll answer it when we get back to the back half of the year. But is there anything that stands in the way of that margin recovery?Michael J. FiddelkeI think it's the factors we've been talking about for a while now, Simeon. And to see a return to positive comp growth in some of those higher-margin discretionary categories, that would be a welcome benefit to margin, for sure. One of the things we'll need to continue to watch is the pressure we've seen from shortage. If You go back to where we were pre-pandemic, I mean, that is one of the single biggest margin headwinds in the business. And so the path of stabilization, we were pleased to see shortage come in as we forecasted in Q2, but that's still a material headwind on a year-over-year basis, on a 2-year basis. And so I think that will be an important variable to watch going forward as well.Brian C. CornellMichael, on that note, as we wrap up the call today, I certainly want to thank our entire team for their efforts throughout the quarter. I particularly want to recognize our asset protection teams. We've talked a lot over the last couple of quarters about the pressures we've been facing with organized retail crime, and I really appreciate the work that our asset protection teams do each and every day to keep our guests safe, our team safe and allow us to operate safely each and every day. So thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you later this year. That wraps up our second quarter call.OperatorGoodbye.]"

(NYSE:TXT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Textron, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Textron ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Textron?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Textron. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Textron's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Textron. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 8.7% of the stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of TextronWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Textron Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$67m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Canadian Pacific Kansas City’s plans to drum up additional cross-border business will benefit shippers wanting to use the eastern U.S. Class I railroads to access markets in the Southeast, according to executives speaking at an investor conference this week.“I haven’t seen a new interchange pop up [in my years at CSX] … that is going to be as significant as this one,” CSX CFO Sean Pelkey said at Deutsche Bank’s transportation conference for investors Tuesday.Pelkey was referring to plans that CPKC and CSX will create a new direct interchange connection in Alabama via acquiring or operating portions of the Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad, which operates in Mississippi and Alabama and is owned by short line operator Genesee &amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W). G&amp;W, CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) and CPKC (NYSE: CP) announced their plans in late June, saying then that the change would establish a new freight corridor connecting Mexico, Texas and the U.S. Southeast. The Surface Transportation Board will need to approve the plans.Although Norfolk Southern isn’t a party to this partnership, NS President and CEO Alan Shaw said it also has a relationship with CPKC in which shippers can utilize the Meridian Speedway to go between Texas and Mexico and the Southeast. NS (NYSE: NSC) also has its own service products, including those that involve partners J.B. Hunt and the Hub Group.Rather, the larger issue in the Southeast lanes to and from Texas and Mexico is less about direct rail competitors and more about “taking freight off the highway,” according to NS CFO Mark George.Shaw said, “The one reason rail has lost share to truck is service. If we think of ourselves as a service organization … we know we can grow, particularly with our franchise.”He said that is why NS has chosen to retain employees instead of furloughing them in market downturns, which had until recently been considered as industry practice and a means to cut costs. When market demand returns, NS will have the staffing to meet service needs and market demand.Story continuesMeanwhile, the question about how volume shares shift between the West Coast and East Coast ports is not much of a concern for CSX and NS because both railways also work with their western U.S. Class I railroad counterparts to bring volumes inland.A “healthy” West Coast port system is “also good” for CSX, Pelkey said, adding that there’s also inland port business and business that moves to the Midwest from the East Coast ports.When asked about how the departure of Jamie Boychuk, who served as CSX’s chief operations officer, will affect the company, Pelkey said there is institutional knowledge and experience in place to both ensure smooth operations and drum up more business. Concerted efforts to better coordinate CSX’s sales and marketing teams and its operations teams should also benefit the railroad and its customers.CSX’s leadership teams have been talking with each other “about all the opportunity that’s out there. How do we break down some of the barriers that exist across our organizations? Anytime you’ve got 20,000 people across an organization of our size, you’re going to have silos. How do we work through that?” Pelkey said.“We’re six years into the scheduled railroading journey. It’s in our DNA. You’ve got a team of leaders across the operations group who understands what that plan looks like, how to run that plan, and the repeatability of that plan is what makes it so successful,” Pelkey said, noting that Ricky Johnson, senior vice president of transportation, and Casey Albright, SVP of network operations and service design, would be available in Boychuk’s absence.“Ultimately, whenever there’s a significant change like that in an organization, you look for how the organization is going to respond. I would say that there’s a lot of optimism about what we can do going forward and so we’re not going to look backwards — we’re going to come together.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:CSX exec to depart; rail shippers urge renomination of STB membersCSX continues to target truck-to-rail conversionsFRA, OSHA call on Norfolk Southern to review safety practicesNS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailmentThe post Cross-border traffic, West Coast port activity benefit Eastern railroads appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 10.4% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.Bearish Industry Rank: The industry to which NSC belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 233 (of 250 plus groups). Such an unfavorable rank places NSC in the bottom 12% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to.A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, reckoning the industry’s performance becomes imperative.Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: Norfolk Southern currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Moreover, NSC’s current Momentum Style Score of C shows its short-term unattractiveness.An Underperformer: The Norfolk Southern stock has lost 18.9% in a year's time compared with its industry’s 6.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Headwinds: NSC is being negatively impacted by weak freight conditions. The top line has been suffering due to below-par performances of all three key segments, namely, Merchandise, Intermodal and Coal. Revenues are likely to be weak throughout 2023. Our estimate for current-year total revenues indicates a 4.1% dip from 2022 actuals.Supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity are further challenges confronting the company. Owing to these headwinds, overall volumes have been weak. Moreover, costs have been high primarily due to expenses associated with the Eastern Ohio incident. Apart from low revenues, high costs are also affecting operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues).Story continuesStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and Delta Air Lines DAL. While UAL sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DAL carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our projection for third-quarter total revenues hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year.For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days.Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding Delta. Due to the positive, DAL reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in second-quarter 2023. Third-quarter earnings are forecast in the range of $2.2-$2.5 per share.Management raised its earnings per share outlook for the current year. The company now estimates 2023 earnings (on an adjusted basis) in the band of $6-$7 per share (previous view: $6).

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.4% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.82 indicates a change of +7% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.01 billion and $47.43 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.03%. The EPS surprise was +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Waste Management is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$32b - US$4.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Commercial Services industry average of 8.5% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Waste Management roceIn the above chart we have measured Waste Management's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 46% in that time. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Waste Management's ROCEIn the end, Waste Management has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Waste Management, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The company has also been benefiting from significant cost reductions, improved supply chains, stabilized inventories, strong consumer demand in Mexico and solid market share.The company remains focused on portfolio transformation initiatives, targeting higher-growth and higher-margin businesses. It is poised to reap gains from the housing-driven demand recovery, as it now has eight of the top 10 national builders as its trade customers. WHR remains on track with its long-term targets, with profitable growth of 5-6% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 11%-12%.Whirlpool also remains committed to protecting margins and productivity amid ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. WHR implemented several cost reduction actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities and effectively managing working capital. In second-quarter 2023, its cost-take-out actions delivered a $150-million benefit on a year-over-year basis.It remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through share buyback programs and dividend payouts. In the first six months of 2023, the company returned $193 million in cash to shareholders as dividends. As of Jun 30, 2023, it had $2.6 billion remaining as share repurchase authorization.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 5.5%.However, the company has been reeling under a challenging operating environment and sluggish global demand from high inflation. The second quarter’s net sales of $4,792 million dropped 6% from the year-ago quarter. For 2023, it forecasts net sales of $19.4 billion, suggesting a 1-2% decline from the prior-year actual.Despite improvements, Whirlpool has been witnessing supply chain disruptions in some parts of the world. The company is also ailing from an unfavorable product price/mix and high raw material costs. In the second quarter, WHR’s gross profit declined by 9% year-over-year to $816 million.High debt levels also remain concerning for Whirlpool, raising financial obligations and draining profitability. The company ended the second quarter with long-term debt of $6,393 million, up 32.3% on a year-over-year basis. Further, its debt load appears too high to be managed by its cash and cash equivalents of $1,309 million as of Jun 30, 2023.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies in the consumer discretionary sector are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Alto Ingredients ALTO.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

307,5ea9e698-bdba-34a3-8d7b-4350fbfbdafd,IR,2023-08-17,Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Ingersoll Rand Inc.'s (NYSE:IR) Stock Up Recently?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-ingersoll-115942262.html,1692273582,STORY,"['IR', 'TT']","[Ingersoll Rand's (NYSE:IR) stock is up by a considerable 12% over the past three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Ingersoll Rand's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ingersoll Rand is:7.3% = US$694m ÷ US$9.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.07 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Ingersoll Rand's Earnings Growth And 7.3% ROEAt first glance, Ingersoll Rand's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Despite this, surprisingly, Ingersoll Rand saw an exceptional 29% net income growth over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Ingersoll Rand's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.9%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is IR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ingersoll Rand Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Ingersoll Rand's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 3.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.While Ingersoll Rand has seen growth in its earnings, it only recently started to pay a dividend. It is most likely that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 3.3%. However, Ingersoll Rand's ROE is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Ingersoll Rand has some positive aspects to its business. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

LKQ.Industry: Auto PartsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2136841/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-riding-the-industrys-optimismAging vehicles are a key catalyst for the bright prospects of the Zacks Automotive Replacement Parts industry. In a bid to ensure the sustained operability of their older vehicles, consumers are opting to invest in the substitution of defective parts and constituents. Additionally, integration of e-commerce and soaring popularity of technologically advanced vehicles are revolutionizing the industry. However, commodity cost inflation, forex woes and logistical challenges may pose concerns. Industry participants like Genuine Parts Company and LKQ Corp. stand out favorably due to their strategic acquisitions and investor-friendly initiatives.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts.The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Factors at PlayVehicle Longevity a Key Driver: According to the S&amp;P Global Mobility report released in May, the mean age of automobiles in the United States reached 12.5 years in 2023. This marks the sixth consecutive year of rise in the average age of vehicles and the most substantial annual upturn since the recession of 2008-2009. The escalated pace of the average light vehicle age's growth brings advantages to the automotive replacement sector. A more aged collection of vehicles implies an ongoing requirement for repair and maintenance to uphold proper functionality.Story continuesTypically aligned with the advancement in the mean vehicle age, the industry's course is experiencing growth, as consumers allocate more resources to sustain the operation of their maturing automobiles. Consequently, there has been a noticeable upsurge in the demand for automotive replacement parts.New Opportunities Arising from Technology: The automotive sector is experiencing a transformative shift, driven by the widespread integration of cutting-edge technology and swift digitization, resulting in a complete overhaul of the market landscape. This transformation has opened up new growth avenues for the auto replacement parts industry. As the electrification and autonomous driving trends gain momentum, industry participants are redoubling their efforts to engineer technologically sophisticated components.Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced technologies and components that may require replacement over time. This includes electronic systems, sensors and other specialized parts that contribute to the growth of replacement part demand.Digitization Ramp up: The surge of e-commerce and online retail has reshaped the auto replacement parts industry by providing unprecedented accessibility, diversity of options and convenience for consumers. Through online platforms, customers can easily compare a wide array of replacement parts, read reviews, and access comprehensive product information, enabling informed purchasing decisions. The global reach of e-commerce allows customers to source specialized parts from various regions. This digital transformation benefits both “Do-It-Yourself” enthusiasts and professional mechanics, streamlining the process of finding and acquiring the necessary components. Overall, e-commerce has empowered consumers, expanded market access, and revolutionized the industry's growth trajectory by enhancing customer engagement and choice.Cost-Related Challenges are Concerning: The emergence of highly advanced automotive components is exerting notable pressure on the profit margins of auto replacement parts. Escalating commodity costs compound these issues and could potentially undermine profitability. Additionally, the widespread international footprint of many industry participants renders them vulnerable to foreign exchange complexities. Adverse currency conversions might affect earnings and margins. Moreover, the industry is contending with logistical hurdles and supply chain disruptions, which serve to further curtail potential growth prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #79, which places it in the top 31% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of the year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 2.3% north.Before we present two stocks from the industry worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.

317,79e7fff6-1c80-3dc8-80d0-b34679d26386,LKQ,2023-08-17,2 Auto Replacement Parts Stocks Riding the Industry's Optimism,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-131600718.html,1692191760,STORY,"['LKQ', 'GPC']","[Aging vehicles are a key catalyst for the bright prospects of the Zacks Automotive Replacement Parts industry. In a bid to ensure the sustained operability of their older vehicles, consumers are opting to invest in the substitution of defective parts and constituents. Additionally, integration of e-commerce and soaring popularity of technologically advanced vehicles are revolutionizing the industry. However, commodity cost inflation, forex woes and logistical challenges may pose concerns. Industry participants like Genuine Parts Company GPC and LKQ Corporation LKQ stand out favorably due to their strategic acquisitions and investor-friendly initiatives.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. Some important auto replacement components are engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts. The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Factors at PlayVehicle Longevity is a Key Driver: According to the S&amp;P Global Mobility report released in May, the mean age of automobiles in the United States reached 12.5 years in 2023. This marks the sixth consecutive year of rise in the average age of vehicles and the most substantial annual upturn since the recession of 2008-2009. The escalated pace of the average light vehicle age's growth brings advantages to the automotive replacement sector. A more aged collection of vehicles implies an ongoing requirement for repair and maintenance to uphold proper functionality. Typically aligned with the advancement in the mean vehicle age, the industry's course is experiencing growth, as consumers allocate more resources to sustain the operation of their maturing automobiles. Consequently, there has been a noticeable upsurge in the demand for automotive replacement parts.Story continuesNew Opportunities Arising from Technology: The automotive sector is experiencing a transformative shift, driven by the widespread integration of cutting-edge technology and swift digitization, resulting in a complete overhaul of the market landscape. This transformation has opened up new growth avenues for the auto replacement parts industry. As the electrification and autonomous driving trends gain momentum, industry participants are redoubling their efforts to engineer technologically sophisticated components. Modern vehicles are equipped with advanced technologies and components that may require replacement over time. This includes electronic systems, sensors and other specialized parts that contribute to the growth of replacement part demand.Digitization Ramp up: The surge of e-commerce and online retail has reshaped the auto replacement parts industry by providing unprecedented accessibility, diversity of options and convenience for consumers.Through online platforms, customers can easily compare a wide array of replacement parts, read reviews, and access comprehensive product information, enabling informed purchasing decisions.  The global reach of e-commerce allows customers to source specialized parts from various regions. This digital transformation benefits both “Do-It-Yourself” enthusiasts and professional mechanics, streamlining the process of finding and acquiring the necessary components. Overall, e-commerce has empowered consumers, expanded market access, and revolutionized the industry's growth trajectory by enhancing customer engagement and choice.Cost-Related Challenges are Concerning: The emergence of highly advanced automotive components is exerting notable pressure on the profit margins of auto replacement parts. Escalating commodity costs compound these issues and could potentially undermine profitability. Additionally, the widespread international footprint of many industry participants renders them vulnerable to foreign exchange complexities. Adverse currency conversions might affect earnings and margins. Moreover, the industry is contending with logistical hurdles and supply chain disruptions, which serve to further curtail potential growth prospects.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Encouraging PictureThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #79, which places it in the top 31% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of the year, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 2.3% north.Before we present two stocks from the industry worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector but Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.

EL is likely to register a top-and-bottom-line decline when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 18.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3,495 million, suggesting a decrease of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has deteriorated by a penny to a loss of 4 cents per share over the past 30 days. The projection indicates a significant decline from earnings of 42 cents reported in the year-ago period. The cosmetics giant has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.2%, on average.For fiscal 2023, the consensus mark for revenues stands at $15.8 billion, suggesting a drop of 10.9% from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $3.35 presently, indicating a 55.7% slump from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Estee Lauder Companies Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe impacts of inflation and unpredictable currency movements have been posing concerns for The Estee Lauder Companies. Additionally, the company has been witnessing greater volatility in the recovery across Asia travel retail. Shipments to duty-free retailers were under pressure in Korea in the last reported quarter.The slower-than-anticipated recovery across Asia travel retail also weighed on the company’s gross margin. These included obsolescence charges, increased promotional costs, an unfavorable brand and category mix and increased inventory levels, among others. Any persistence of these factors remains a concern for the quarter under review and fiscal 2023.For fiscal 2023, management projects net sales to have declined in the band of 10-12% year over year, including an unfavorable currency impact. The view includes a slower-than-anticipated return to growth across Asia travel retail and the termination of certain license agreements.Organic net sales are anticipated to have dropped 5-7%, including currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected in the band of $3.29-$3.39, suggesting a 53-55% decline from the year-ago period’s levels. The bottom line is expected to have declined 50-51% at cc.However, prudent pricing and enhanced product distribution to retailers are likely to have acted as upsides. Organic sales are likely to have increased in the fourth quarter. Apart from Asia, the company expects balanced growth in the fourth quarter in almost all other markets globally. It expects increased consumer demand in mainland China. We expect organic revenue growth of 2.4%, 5.4% and 7.5% respectively in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions in the fourth quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for The Estee Lauder Companies this time.

319,e74a8cb1-67d6-3cbe-9a0d-4199b3cebfe3,PG,2023-08-17,Is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-nyse-pg-using-120028923.html,1692273628,STORY,['PG'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble What Is Procter &amp; Gamble's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Procter &amp; Gamble had debt of US$34.6b, up from US$31.5b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$8.25b, its net debt is less, at about US$26.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Procter &amp; Gamble's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Procter &amp; Gamble had liabilities of US$35.8b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$38.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$8.25b in cash and US$5.47b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$60.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Procter &amp; Gamble has a humongous market capitalization of US$361.2b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Procter &amp; Gamble has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.2. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 42.4 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. While Procter &amp; Gamble doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Procter &amp; Gamble can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Procter &amp; Gamble recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewHappily, Procter &amp; Gamble's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Procter &amp; Gamble is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Procter &amp; Gamble .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

As parents are preparing to safely send their children back to school, they may also have their own parents' safety to consider. While certain seniors have financial aid and post-grad paperwork, other seniors have paperwork related to retirement, healthcare plans and more. These information-laden documents need to be kept in a secure place or properly shredded and destroyed, whether at home, in a dorm room, or at retirement facility.Shred-it, A Stericycle Solution (PRNewsfoto/Shred-it)Many are unaware of the amount of information available and at risk when it comes to paper within the home. Junk mail, such as pre-approved credit card offers, ATM receipts, pay stubs and even invitations and save-the-dates all contain information that bad actors can use for identity theft or fraud. Shred-it® recommends a shred-it-all policy for the workplace and at home.For seniors of all ages, Shred-it® recommends taking the following steps to properly protect and dispose of personal documents that are vulnerable to exposure.Avoid leaving private information exposed: There are many ways to expose confidential data, ranging from leaving sensitive information sitting out on your desk to leaving your computer screen unattended in public. Securely store private information in locked cabinets to keep it safe.Avoid using unsecured disposal bins: It is a common misconception that disposing of physical information in a regular trash can or recycling bin is a safe method. Shredding is one of the most secure ways to dispose of confidential information and to protect your data against malicious actors who may resort to dumpster diving for personal details.Use a professional shredder: Secure paper shredding is still necessary to securely dispose of confidential documents. Standard home office shredders aren't as thorough in their destruction process, cutting paper into vertical or horizontal strips, which can be easily reassembled. Shred-it® is a NAID AAA Certified vendor that offers a variety of shredding services to meet your shredding needs and recycles the paper after.Beware of fraudsters: Always be skeptical and verify the legitimacy of any person or business requesting personal information by checking phone numbers, addresses and official company sources, as well as speaking to a real customer service representative. In 2022, 2.7 million consumers reported fraud to the FTC. Imposters, online shopping and prizes/sweepstakes are the most popular scams today, but credit card fraud, unsolicited phone calls and phishing attacks are the most popular for seniors young and old.Story continuesShred-it® is dedicated to offering document security solutions for high school, college and elderly seniors alike. As data protection requirements and information security best practices continue to evolve, Shred-it® works with businesses and communities to protect what matters. In 2022 alone, Shred-it® securely shredded and recycled 1 billion pounds of paper — safeguarding both confidential information and the environment.

Investors worldwide pay close attention to his strategies. No wonder, his recent 13F filing is under the spotlight.  In the second quarter, Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway established positions in three new stocks: NVR, Lennar and D.R. Horton Inc. What's particularly intriguing about this trio is that all three belong to the homebuilding industry.While it's essential for investors to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, drawing inspiration from Warren Buffett's investment moves is a time-honored practice. Notably, these three stocks have positions in the homebuilding ETFs iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF. Homebuilders have been posting impressive gains throughout the year. Overall, XHB is up 39.5% this year and up 18.5% in the past three months while ITB has advanced 16.2% in the past three months.Does Buffett's Approval Indicate Homebuilders' Value Proposition?The latest homebuilding move indicates that Buffett and his experienced portfolio managers possess a strong conviction in the potential of the industry as a whole. Buffett is a fan of value investing. Berkshire’s acquisition of three stocks despite a great rally this year is tell-tale sign of the remaining value quotient in the homebuilding space. For instance, D.R. Horton boasts a forward price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.15X, Lennar is trading at 9.80 times earnings, and NVR's price-to-earnings multiple stands at 13.99, way lower than the S&amp;P 500 P/E of 20.00X. Moreover, three stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesHomebuilding ETFs to Buy?Homebuilding ETFs like iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The fund ITB and XHB have a P/E ratio of 7.60X and 12.20X.   The fund ITB invests about 35% in the above-mentioned three stocks while the fund XHB invests about 10.5% in those three stocks. Those who fear the company-specific risks, may invest in homebuilding ETFs like ITB and XHB (read: Housing ETFs to Gain Despite a Dip in New Home Sales: Here's Why). These funds underperformed last year, which helped the duo rally hard this year amid favorable operating environment. Though homebuilder sentiment dropped for the first time in seven months, dropping 6 points to 50, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, the situation may improve if the U.S. economy can avoid a recession (which is a likely scenario) and inflation continues to soften. Agreed, high home prices are still a concern. But investors should not forget that demand resumed after the initial surge in mortgage rates, as buyers became used to a new normal interest rate environment.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.Get it free &gt;&gt;Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Aflac's shares on or after the 22nd of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.68 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Aflac has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current stock price of $75.83. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Aflac Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Aflac has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 22% of its income after tax.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Aflac earnings per share are up 5.8% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Aflac has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.1% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Aflac? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Aflac more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Aflac for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Aflac that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Aflac anticipates improved sales within its Aflac Japan segment this year, buoyed by product launches, product updates and Japan Post performance.Improving productivity, contributions from platforms like network dental and vision and group life, and disability are likely to drive the U.S. business’ sales going forward. In the last reported quarter, Aflac U.S. sales of $324 million grew 6.4% year over year.The company’s expense ratio is expected to improve significantly in 2023, dragging the combined ratio down below the year-ago level. Our estimate suggests the combined ratio will stay below 70% in 2023, indicating an improvement from last year’s 74.6%, which will aid its margins. Its costs saving initiatives are expected to drive bottom-line growth. Maintaining a more agile workforce will likely increase AFL’s efficiency over the medium to long term.Story continuesAflac’s balance sheet strength enables the company to take shareholder value boosting measures. It has solid cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, and expects debt maturities of $1.3 billion over the next five years.

(NYSE:GOLD) is one of the largest producers of gold in the world. But CEO Mark Bristow recently emphasized the importance of another metal to keep an eye on.During an interview with CNBC, Bristow said, ""My view is that copper is the most strategic metal out of all the metals.""He pointed out that batteries are a major driver for copper demand, but there's more to the story.""Batteries is not a long-term solution for the future of a better planet for all,"" Bristow said. ""What's really important is greening our grids, and we've started seeing that with big cable connections around Europe. And we've got to take the greener energy or renewable energy to the industrial regions. And to do that you need big cables and the only way you can transport electricity is with copper.""Bristow noted that even if all vehicles in California became battery-powered, it wouldn't be enough to save the planet.""The way to really protect and leave a better planet for future generations is to develop the underdeveloped economy,"" he said.And because of copper's critical role in development, it stands as the most strategic metal.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.How To Invest In CopperBecause of its strategic significance, copper presents potential opportunities for investors.During the interview, Bristow said that the fundamentals of copper suggest ""we're going to be in short supply very, very soon"" and ""everything points to a better copper price in the future.""If you share that view and want to invest in copper, there are several ways to go about it.Story continuesYou can invest in physical copper by purchasing copper bars, coins or rounds from a metals dealer. You can invest in copper futures. Or you can buy shares of copper-mining companies such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto plc (NYSE:RIO) and BHP Group Ltd. (NYSE:BHP). Barrick Gold also produces copper.Investors also can use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to the metal. For instance, the United States Copper Index Fund (NYSE:CPER) is designed to be a convenient way for investors to access the returns of a portfolio of copper futures contracts.Gold Is Not ForgottenWhile highlighting copper's value, Bristow also touched upon gold, noting that it has always been a ""go-to asset.""""Right now we have a situation in the world where there's a question mark over whether the dollar will stand up as a reserve currency into the future,"" he said.Fitch Ratings recently downgraded the United States' long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from its highest AAA rating to AA+. The credit rating agency pointed to ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years,""  a ""high and growing general government debt burden"" and an ""erosion of governance"" as reasons behind the decision.After Fitch's downgrade, the price of gold rose about 0.6% on the news but has since pared those gains.Bristow acknowledged that gold has been under pressure ""because of the yields with the increase in interest rates on the back of inflation."" He also pointed out that the yellow metal is ""one currency politicians can't print.""Gold has served as a store of value for thousands of years. Unlike fiat money, which can be produced in unlimited quantities by central banks, precious metals have an inherent scarcity, making them a valuable hedge against inflation.While gold doesn't offer a yield, new companies have innovated ways for investors to earn passive income from inflation-resistant assets.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for odronextamab to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies. The EMA previously granted odronextamab Orphan Drug Designation for FL and DLBCL. Odronextamab is an investigational CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.FL and DLBCL are the two most common subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). FL is a slow-growing subtype, with patients often relapsing within five years. DLBCL is an aggressive subtype, with up to 50% of high-risk patients experiencing progression after first-line treatment (e.g., relapsing or refractory to treatment). As these blood cancers progress, they become increasingly hard to treat, especially in the third-line setting and beyond, leaving patients with few treatment options.The MAA is supported by data from a Phase 1 and pivotal Phase 2 trial (ELM-1 and ELM-2) investigating odronextamab in FL and DLBCL, which were last presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.Regeneron is conducting a broad Phase 3 development program to further investigate odronextamab in earlier lines of therapy and additional B-NHLs, representing one of the largest clinical programs in lymphoma. Odronextamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Odronextamab TrialsELM-2 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 2 trial investigating odronextamab in more than 500 patients across five independent disease-specific cohorts, including DLBCL, FL, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and other subtypes of B-NHL. The primary endpoint is objective response rate according to the Lugano Classification, and secondary endpoints include complete response, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and quality of life.Story continuesELM-1 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1 trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of odronextamab in patients with CD20+ B-cell malignancies previously treated with CD20-directed antibody therapy.About Regeneron’s Approach to Cancer ResearchAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer.Our portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities.

343,b021fa84-bda0-3204-8663-de6d3ac4af51,REGN,2023-08-17,The 7 Best Value Stocks to Buy in August,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-value-stocks-buy-011518205.html,1691716518,STORY,"['TGT', 'TS', 'REGN', 'WIRE', 'LTHM', 'BHP', 'ARCH', 'TSM']","[While several market ideas have blossomed this year, many are overpriced, which naturally draws eyes to the best value stocks to buy. Here, we’re talking about publicly traded securities that trade at a lower price relative to fundamental metrics, most commonly sales or earnings. Obviously, value investing opportunities entice market participants due to their underlying discount. As humans, we’re geared to respond positively toward bargain offers. Essentially, by targeting must-buy value stocks, we’re receiving far more for our money than would otherwise be possible.Also, acquiring leading value stocks aligns with a common-sense tactic. If you acquire overheated securities now, there’s a chance that a broader sell off could exponentially cause pain. However, undervalued entities theoretically should mitigate the severity of the pain since they’re already flying under the radar.On that note, below are top value stocks for August.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)REGN stock, Regeneron's logo on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDuring the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) saw significant interest because of its research and development toward a therapeutic. However, with fading fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, REGN lost much of its immediate luster. However, unlike other Covid-related plays, REGN didn’t fall off the map. In fact, it’s still one of the best value stocks to buy.Financially, Regeneron is trying to restore momentum under a post-pandemic context. In the second quarter of this year, the company posted revenue of $3.16 billion, up 10.5% from the $2.86 billion rung up in the year-ago quarter. Over the past three years, Regeneron printed a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.3%, above 69.58% of its peers.Right now, the market prices shares at 19.32x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 27.18x. Finally, analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $859.88, implying over 9% upside potential.Story continuesBHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockA metals and mining stalwart, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) arguably makes an excellent case for best value stocks to buy. Currently, so much interest focuses on the hottest flavors of the moment, such as artificial intelligence or electric vehicles. However, relatively few investors concern themselves with entities that physically undergird such innovations. Thus, BHP finds itself down 3% since the Jan. opener.I suspect this underperformance won’t last too long. Notably, the company features a consistently profitable business, commanding a trailing-year net margin of nearly 46%. This stat ranks higher than almost 94% of enterprises in the metals and mining industry. Also, its return on equity (ROE) stands at a staggering 61.36%, outflanking 98.37% of rivals. Nevertheless, BHP trades at a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.54x, favorably below 62.7% of the competition.Lastly, analysts peg BHP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $70.80, implying nearly 19% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the intriguing value investing opportunities.Tenaris (TS)Value stocks: A hand places wooden cutouts of the letters in the word ""value"" on a surface.Source: patpitchaya / Shutterstock.comA global manufacturer and supplier of steel pipes and related services, Tenaris (NYSE:TS) might not be a household name. However, it deserves consideration for those seeking the best value stocks to buy. Primarily, Tenaris provides its products and services to the energy industry. Logically, this framework may bode well for TS stock. Recently, CNN reports that are oil prices are rising, thus sparking a rebound in energy enterprises.However, this year, investors aren’t really paying much attention to Tenaris. Since the January opener, TS only gained less than half-a-percent above parity. Nevertheless, the company easily ranks among must-buy value stocks. From excellent stability in the balance sheet to robust revenue and EBITDA growth to consistent profitability and high margins, Tenaris does it all.Also, TS trades at a forward multiple of 5.8. As a discount to projected earnings, Tenaris ranks better than 78.55% of the competition. In closing, analysts peg TS as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $42.56, implying over 26% upside potential.Arch Resources (ARCH)An image of heaps of coalSource: ShutterstockAt first glance, American coal mining and processing firm Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) might seem like one of the best value stocks to buy but only from an ironic sense. Basically, the political and ideological winds favor green this and green that. That’s why we have so much interest in clean-emissions vehicles. Still, the brutal reality is that the underlying power must come from somewhere. In many regions, it’s still coal.While Arch might not be everyone’s favorite idea for leading value stocks, it still makes a solid case for itself. Right now, the company benefits from a robust balance sheet. It also prints an impressive three-year FCF growth rate of 77.7%, beating out 91.62% of its peers. Nevertheless, ARCH trades at only 3.62x FCF, lower than 81.2% of sector players. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ARCH a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target comes in at $177.50, implying nearly 29% upside potential. Therefore, it could be one of the top value stocks for August.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comIf you’ve been following the news (particularly about the technology sector), you might be pensive about Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Yes, it might appear to be one of the best value stocks to buy. However, critics might argue that there’s a reason for it. Indeed, recent concerns about fading demand for smartphones and PCs crimped enterprises like Taiwan Semi.Still, investors might not want to hit the panic button just yet. Since the start of the year, TSM is still up nearly 27%. Further, it enjoys compelling financial stats. For example, the company’s three-year revenue and EBITDA growth rates ping at 28.4% and 32.8%, respectively. Both metrics are well above sector averages. Also, Taiwan Semi continues to be a consistently profitable enterprise.Despite the top stats, the market prices TSM at only 19.32x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 25.93x. Looking to the Street, analysts peg TSM a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $125, implying 33% upside potential.Livent (LTHM)Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockOne of the more intriguing ideas for best value stocks to buy, Livent (NYSE:LTHM) specializes in lithium technology. Per its website, the company features a fully integrated product portfolio that mainly serves the EV market. As well, it offers energy storage applications as well as uses such as polymers and synthesis. Not surprisingly, LTHM stock popped up almost 23% since the start of the year. However, in the past month, LTHM gave up 18% of equity value. Questions about the stability of the consumer economy have started to impact sectors like EVs, which may play a role in the volatility. Still, for those who have a long-term mindset, Livent appears tempting.Financially, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 15%, above 67.33% of its peers. Its net margin also impresses at nearly 39%. Nevertheless, the market prices shares at only 11.19X forward earnings, favorably below 74.17% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg LTHM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $32.19, implying over 38% upside potential.Encore Wire (WIRE)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in McKinney, Texas, Encore Wire (NASDAQ:WIRE) produces high-quality industrial wires and cables. While it might seem like a boring name among best value stocks to buy, that’s what makes Encore appealing. It’s an infrastructure play and as a result, it doesn’t get much airtime. Still, those who know recognize the underlying relevancies. Since the Jan. opener, WIRE stock gained over 25% of equity value.Despite the robust return, WIRE still makes for one of the must-buy value stocks to consider. For one thing, Encore suffers zero debt, affording it incredible financial flexibility. On the top line, the company prints an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 36.7%, beating out 93.2% of its peers. Also, its net margin comes in at 20.7%.Despite these impressive stats, WIRE trades at 5.45x FCF. In sharp contrast, the sector median stat runs at a lofty 24.19x. Finally, D.A. Davidson’s Brent Thielman pegs WIRE a buy with a $240 price target. This implies nearly 44% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:AMP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 86%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-inc-nyse-amp-110025367.html,1692270025,STORY,['AMP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Ameriprise Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 16 shareholders Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Ameriprise Financial, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Ameriprise Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Ameriprise Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Ameriprise Financial is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Ameriprise Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$135m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

GPS, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. OLLI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Best Retail Stocks to Buy on Robust July SalesRetail sales grew in July driven by robust consumer spending, the Commerce Department said on Aug 15. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike campaign is finally bearing fruit as inflation has sharply declined over the past year. The impact is showing in the steady growth in retail sales over the past few months.Given this situation, investing in stocks like The Gap, Inc., The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc. and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. will be a wise option.Retail Sales JumpRetail sales jumped a solid 0.7% to $696.4 billion in July, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4%, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding autos, retail sales rose a solid 1% in July, surpassing expectations of a 0.4% rise. This follows a 0.2% rise in June.This has so far been the best reading since January 2023. Also, e-commerce sales increased a robust 1.9%, while sales at restaurants and bars rose 1.4%. Sales at sporting goods stores climbed 1.5%.The report indicates that the U.S. economy is still going strong and might avoid slipping into a recession. The jump in retail sales comes as inflation continues to steadily decline from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July for the first time in more than 12 months. The modest rise in July indicates that there is still solid demand for goods, which is driving sales.Story continuesOn a year-over-year basis, retail sales rose 3.2% in July, in line with the annual CPI increase.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with June being the only exception. This has taken the benchmark borrowing rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, a steady decline in inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its current interest rate hike campaign. This bodes well for the retail sector as lower interest rates will give more purchasing power to consumers.Our ChoicesThe Gap, Inc. is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories and personal care products.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category.

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike campaign is finally bearing fruit as inflation has sharply declined over the past year. The impact is showing in the steady growth in retail sales over the past few months.Given this situation, investing in stocks like The Gap, Inc. GPS, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. OLLI will be a wise option.Retail Sales JumpRetail sales jumped a solid 0.7% to $696.4 billion in July, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.4%, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding autos, retail sales rose a solid 1% in July, surpassing expectations of a 0.4% rise. This follows a 0.2% rise in June.This has so far been the best reading since January 2023. Also, e-commerce sales increased a robust 1.9%, while sales at restaurants and bars rose 1.4%. Sales at sporting goods stores climbed 1.5%.The report indicates that the U.S. economy is still going strong and might avoid slipping into a recession. The jump in retail sales comes as inflation continues to steadily decline from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% in July for the first time in more than 12 months. The modest rise in July indicates that there is still solid demand for goods, which is driving sales.On a year-over-year basis, retail sales rose 3.2% in July, in line with the annual CPI increase.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, with June being the only exception. This has taken the benchmark borrowing rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, a steady decline in inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end its current interest rate hike campaign. This bodes well for the retail sector as lower interest rates will give more purchasing power to consumers.Our ChoicesThe Gap, Inc. is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories and personal care products.
