While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance data provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.1%.Revenues are expected to be $758.43 million, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verisk?For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verisk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verisk would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +7.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verisk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, S&amp;P Global (SPGI) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.78 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -21.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.91 billion, up 39.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for S&amp;P Global has been revised 3.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.67%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that S&amp;P Global will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Next, Dow Jones provided an ESG-scored list to IBD of all the U.S.-traded companies it tracks, a total of 2,208. IBD then cut the list to 1,693 companies by removing non-public companies and companies with stock prices below $10 a share. Companies that lacked sufficient data to create an IBD Composite rating were also removed. IBD further qualified the list by cutting it to the top 15% of the 1,693, using their ESG scores, and then selected the 100 with the highest IBD Composite Rating—all with scores of 81 or better. Finally, IBD ranked the 100 companies by Dow Jones' ESG score.Story continuesAbout VeriskVerisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) provides data-driven analytic insights and solutions for the insurance and energy industries.

2,e35c6ea5-cd78-3dfe-8e76-7896ade28d5a,SCHW,2022-10-26,Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-nyse-schw-stock-120048046.html,1666785648,STORY,['SCHW'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have seen the share price rise 77% over three years, well in excess of the market return (24%, not including dividends).Since it's been a strong week for Charles Schwab shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 6.9% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Charles Schwab's TSR for the last 3 years was 84%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Charles Schwab shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 12% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Charles Schwab is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

3,616809c1-1850-3aa6-84b5-70e304cb980e,SCHW,2022-10-26,10 Biggest ETF Companies in USA,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-etf-companies-usa-153040373.html,1666711840,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'JPM', 'STT', 'SCHW', 'BLK']","[In this article, we will take a look at 10 of the biggest ETF companies in the USA. If you want to see more of the biggest ETF companies in the USA, go directly to 5 Biggest ETF Companies in USA.ETFs have risen in popularity recently.Global ETF assets have increased from $3.4 trillion in 2016 to over $10 trillion in November of 2021. According to a January 26, 2022 PwC report, there's a lot more growth in the future too,""However, given global ETF AuM growth of 22% over the last five years ending December 2020, combined with record inflows, new entrants, innovative products and distribution opportunities, we believe that a projection of over USD 20 trillion global ETF AUM by 2026 can be achieved, representing a 17% CAGR over the next five years.""There are several reasons for ETFs' popularity.ETFs can be low cost. In terms of actively managed mutual funds, the expense ratio can be between 0.5% of assets every year to 1.5% of assets every year. In comparison to actively managed mutual funds, most passive ETFs cost less.When picked correctly, ETFs can offer diversification and some ETFs also have a long history of success as well. While many ETFs do not do as well because they cover sectors that don't do very well, some ETFs have done well in the long run. One such example is biggest ETF of all, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF.According to its data, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, as of September 30, 2022, has averaged an annual return of 11.56% in terms of its NAV over the last 10 years. Moreover, The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF's performance tracks closely to its intended benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 index, which has had average annual returns of 11.7% over the last 10 years as of September 30, 20222022Given the market decline this year, however, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is down almost 24% year to date as of September 30, 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the financial markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates five times this year given the high inflation. Given the higher interest rates, the probability of a recession has increased substantially as a result. Some economists think that the odds are over 60% while others think it's even higher.Story continuesBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) explains its thinking on the events and its potential effects,""In the Great Moderation, a period of steady growth and inflation, central banks would have eased policy on signs of contracting growth. That era is over. Now central banks are set to induce recessions by overtightening policy. In this supply-driven recession, high inflation and rising rates may break the fragile equilibrium where investors tolerated surging debt loads and forwent a higher term premium, or compensation for the risk of holding long-term bonds.""Due to the headwinds, many asset classes have fallen substantially year to date. Emerging market equities, U.S. equities, global high yield, U.S. 10 Year Treasury, European equities have all fallen more than 10% year to date and in some cases more than 20%. Given the poor performances, ETFs have experienced headwinds as lower asset prices mean less fees.Nevertheless, there still have been inflows to ETFs despite the challenging market.Director of ETF Research and Analytics Elisabeth Kashner commented, ""First half 2022 flows of $332 billion exceed full-year levels for every year from 1993-2016, nearly match full-year 2018 and 2019 flows, and equal 64% of full-year 2020 flows.""Financial Companies That Have BenefitedIn terms of the companies that have benefited from the rise of ETFs, ETF issuers are among the chief beneficiaries.Given the U.S. economy is the largest in the world and the U.S. dollar is the leading global reserve currency, most of the leading financial companies that issue ETFs are based in the USA. Some, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) are also listed on the NYSE.Although the financial companies don't make as much revenue as mutual fund companies do from their assets, the sheer amount of assets can still make offering ETFs profitable for the largest financial institutions.The following are 10 of the largest ETF issuers based in the USA.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 10 from Statista's Largest providers of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States as of July 2022, by assets under management list.10 Biggest ETF Companies in USA10. VanEckETF Assets Under Management: $51.93 billionVanEck is an innovative U.S. asset manager. VanEck was one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer American investors access to international markets and the company also recognized early the transformative potential of ETFs. As a result, VanEck is one of the 10 biggest ETF companies in the USA today with ETF assets under management of almost $52 billion.Like VanEck, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) are among the biggest ETF companies in the USA.9. ProSharesETF Assets Under Management: $57.68 billionProShares has been at the forefront of the ETF revolution since 2006 as it has a broad portfolio of ETFs that allow investing in dividend growers, thematic investing, ex-sector investing and more. Ex-Sector investing in certain ETFs allows investors to tailor the S&amp;P 500 by making it simple to underweight or even exclude one sector from a portfolio. This could be useful if an investor believes one sector will underperfrom another sector in the future. As of July 2022, ProShares had ETF Assets Under Management of almost $57.7 billion.8. World Gold CouncilETF Assets Under Management: $66.46 billionAccording to the Wall Street Journal, ""The World Gold Council, a group funded by mining companies, sought to revive gold demand by making it easier to buy and sell physical metal. They hit upon an ETF, still a relatively obscure investment product at that time. ETFs sell shares and use the proceeds to buy another asset, such as gold or stocks. GLD launched on Nov. 18, 2004 under State Street Corp.’s now-defunct streetTRACKS brand, later renamed SPDR.""As a result of investor interest, World Gold Council has ETF assets under management of $66.46 billion according to Statista. The $66.46 billion could be characterized as part of State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) depending on the exact terms of the ETF.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)ETF Assets Under Management: $78.85 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a leading financial institution that does many different things including issuing ETFs. In terms of ETFs, the company has more than 30 ETFs offered across asset classes and also management strategies. Some ETFs include market cap-weighted ETFs while others include equity ETFs. As of July 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) had ETF Assets Under Management of almost $79 billion.While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the larger ETF companies in the USA, the bank also offers a lot of other services such as consumer, corporate, and government banking.For its third quarter of 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported net income of $9.7 billion and revenue of $32.7 billion. The company realized an ROTCE of 18% and a CET1 capital ratio of 12.5%. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said,In the U.S., consumers continue to spend with solid balance sheets, job openings are plentiful and businesses remain healthy. However, there are significant headwinds immediately in front of us – stubbornly high inflation leading to higher global interest rates, the uncertain impacts of quantitative tightening, the war in Ukraine, which is increasing all geopolitical risks, and the fragile state of oil supply and prices. While we are hoping for the best, we always remain vigilant and are prepared for bad outcomes so we can continue to serve customers even in the most challenging of times.6. First TrustETF Assets Under Management: $128.98 billionFirst Trust is a U.S. based asset manager that was founded in 1991 that had collective assets under management or supervision of around $193 billion as of August 31, 2022.

While the 401(k) remains the top retirement savings vehicle for today’s workers overall, Gen Z and Millennial workers are more likely to also invest in cryptocurrency, real estate, annuities, and small businesses, unlike older generations.""Younger workers today are beginning their financial journey from a different place than older generations did when they began,"" said Catherine Golladay, Head of Schwab Workplace Financial Services. ""They are questioning traditional approaches to both work and retirement as they have changed jobs and reconsidered priorities during the pandemic. The 401(k), while still their primary retirement savings tool, is no longer viewed as their only path to retirement. They see an opportunity to reach their financial goals through diverse assets that are making them excited about investing and engaged in their financial futures.""Only 37% of Gen Z workers say their first investing experience was through a 401(k), a lower proportion than Millennials (54%), Gen X (61%) and Boomers (61%). Instead, many Gen Z workers first got involved in investing through mobile trading (22%), cryptocurrency (11%), traditional brokerage accounts (10%) and health savings accounts (9%).Younger workers want more choicesIn the past year, many Gen Z (38%) and Millennial (27%) workers changed employers and they have had the opportunity to take a fresh look at how they are saving and investing. Young workers say they want a wider range of investment options and vehicles. More than 4 in 10 Gen Z and Millennial workers wish they could invest in annuities and cryptocurrency in their 401(k). More than a third wish they could select ESG investments, and nearly as many say they’re interested in fractional shares. More than 7 in 10 younger workers say it’s important that their 401(k) investments reflect their personal values.Story continuesAbout half of all employees (48%) who are offered a health savings account (HSA) by their employer are using it, primarily to pay current healthcare expenses. About half of Gen Z (52%) and Millennial (48%) workers are also using their HSAs to save for future healthcare costs in retirement, and more than half are investing their HSAs in mutual funds and other types of investments.""All workers want to feel heard, and it makes a powerful statement when an employer can demonstrate that their benefits reflect what employees want,"" said Golladay. ""The odds are that younger hires are already exploring their next job or will be soon. Employers seeking to retain talent must consider the saving and investing preferences of young workers as they evaluate their benefit programs.""Retirement expectationsRising costs and market volatility continue to cause concern for all workers, but Gen Z and Millennial workers are more likely than older workers to cite unexpected expenses, education costs, and supporting family members as obstacles to saving for retirement.Still, younger workers are staying optimistic and intend to retire early into an active lifestyle that includes enjoying life, travel, and spending time with family. Gen Z wants to retire at 60 and Millennials at 62, compared to 64 and 67 for Gen X and Boomers. More than 90% of younger workers say they are very or somewhat likely to achieve their retirement savings goals.Gen Z thinks they need to save $1.4 million for retirement while Millennials estimate $1.8 million, and all generations think their savings will last about the same amount of time. Gen Z and Boomers estimate having enough for 25 years, while Millennials and Gen X say 22 years. However, more than a quarter of Gen Z workers don’t know how much they will need in monthly income to live comfortably in retirement.From Internet to IRL: Young Workers Cast Wide Net for AdviceYounger generations are more open to financial wellness tools, including online tools to help save for retirement, build an emergency savings fund, and manage debt. They are also open to help from a financial professional to develop a plan and stay on track. In fact, Gen Z (83%) and Millennials (82%) see more need for personalized advice for their 401(k) than Gen X (79%) and Boomers (67%). Younger workers prefer human over computer-generated advice but are very likely to utilize both, while Boomers are less likely to follow both human and computer-generated advice.Gen Z (24%) and Millennials (20%) are more likely to use social media for financial advice than Gen X (14%) and Boomers (2%). More than a third seek advice from family and friends (40% and 35% for Gen Z and Millennials versus 24% and 16% for Gen X and Boomers). Nearly half of Gen Z and Millennials want help calculating how much money they need to save for retirement. Other areas of interest include receiving 401(k) investment advice, determining retirement age, and managing expenses.""Even with an uncertain economic outlook, young workers have a lot of reasons to be optimistic and that’s reflected in their attitudes towards saving and investing,"" said Brian Bender, Head of Schwab Retirement Plan Services. ""Of course, time is on their side, but Gen Z and Millennial employees also have access to a combination of investment choices, virtual education, tools, and human advice that previous generations did not have at their age. The best news is that younger workers are open to leveraging all these resources to help them achieve financial security.""About the surveyThis online survey of U.S. 401(k) participants was conducted by Logica Research for Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc. Logica Research is neither affiliated with, nor employed by, Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc. A total of 1,000 plan participants completed the survey. Survey respondents were actively employed by companies with at least 25 employees, were 401(k) plan participants and were 21-70 years old. Survey respondents were not asked to indicate whether they had 401(k) accounts with Schwab Retirement Plan Services, Inc. All data is self-reported by study participants and is not verified or validated. Respondents participated in the study between April 4 and April 19, 2022. Detailed results can be found here.

The news is foiling bets that this year’s $5.5 trillion selloff in tech stocks had reached bottom.The quarterly updates underscored growing pressure on everything from corporate IT budgets to digital ad spending and chips for industrial machinery. The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 2.3% as the results refocused investor attention on the damage to earnings and the economy from the Federal Reserve’s rapid interest rate hikes.“The global economy is at a tipping point,” said Jessica Amir, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “The stronger dollar will continue to hurt businesses’ forward earnings, at a time when consumer demand is likely to fall with the reverse wealth effect expected to grip markets. Pressure remains on riskier asset classes such as tech.”Alphabet now has reported three straight quarters of disappointing earnings per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the longest such streak in seven years. Prior to this year, the company had beaten estimates nine quarters in a row, and had only missed once since the end of 2017.Analysts and investors have been too optimistic this year about other tech giants reporting this week: Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. each have missed on revenue in three of the past four quarters, the data show. Meta publishes earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with Amazon and Apple Inc. to follow on Thursday.Story continuesSigns of weakness were widespread in Tuesday’s results. Microsoft posted its weakest quarterly sales growth in five years, throttled by the surging dollar, slumping PC demand and faltering advertising revenue.Microsoft’s forecast points to a serious slowdown, said Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“This guidance is worse than we had anticipated and shows that enterprise IT spending is decelerating at a faster pace amid rising economic woes,” Rana said.At Alphabet’s most important financial engine, the search and related businesses, sales rose less than analysts estimated as spiraling inflation crimped growth in digital advertising. Microsoft sank 7.7% while Alphabet declined 9.1% for its worst day since March 2020.The selloff extended to other consumer and tech giants, with Amazon dropping 4.1%. Those that derive sales from online advertising followed Alphabet lower, with Meta and Pinterest Inc. dropping 5.6% and 2.4%, respectively.The Nasdaq 100 has plunged 30% this year, on course for its worst annual performance since 2008.The demand outlook was particularly dire in the semiconductor industry, which had been one of the hottest sectors during the pandemic. Texas Instruments, whose chips go into everything from home appliances to missiles, saw shares tumble after its weak forecast signaled that the chip slump is spreading beyond computing and phones into other businesses. The stock lost 2.7%, while Analog Devices Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. also dipped.Tech Chart of the DayTop Tech StoriesAfter reporting earnings and revenue that missed expectations, Alphabet said Tuesday it would slow hiring and control expenses, signaling that it was girding for tough times ahead as the economy falters.Microsoft gave a lackluster forecast for sales growth in its Azure cloud-computing services business, a closely watched measure of corporate demand, sending the shares reeling in early trading Wednesday.Mobileye Global Inc., the self-driving technology company owned by Intel Corp., priced one of the biggest US initial public offerings of the year above its marketed range to raise $861 million.Elon Musk pledged to close the acquisition of Twitter Inc. by Friday in a video conference call with bankers helping fund the deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Foxconn Technology Group is seeing a “small number” of Covid cases at its main campus in China, as the world’s biggest maker of iPhones aims to maintain production amid tightening restrictions in one of the country’s largest cities.Texas Instruments and SK Hynix Inc. offered a gloomy view of the chip market in their latest quarterly reports, dashing hopes of a quick rebound for the $550 billion industry.Billionaire Snap Inc. founder Evan Spiegel rubbished the idea that future computing will migrate into a virtual world dubbed the metaverse, arguing most people prefer a lighter touch known as augmented reality.Spotify Technology SA tumbled as much as 10% in late trading after the company, the leader in music streaming, said profit margins may narrow this quarter because of programming costs, and that it’s considering raising prices in the US.--With assistance from Sohee Kim, Ishika Mookerjee and James Cone.(Updates stock moves throughout.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhen Netflix and HBO Turned on Each Other, They Forged a New Era of TelevisionStudent Debt Headaches Return for Millions Despite Biden ReliefWhat the Alzheimer’s Drug Breakthrough Means for Other DiseasesOne Way to Boost Profits and Reduce Inequality?

Profit will be $1.83 to $2.11 a share, also missing projections.While Texas Instruments has the largest customer list in the semiconductor industry -- making its projections an indicator of demand across the economy -- producers of cars and industrial machinery contribute more than 60% of revenue. Some industrial customers are now slowing their orders, joining makers of computers and phones in cutting back. But demand from the automotive market remains strong, the company said.“During the quarter, we experienced expected weakness in personal electronics and expanding weakness across industrial,” Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton said in the statement. Overall, orders have worsened and cancellations have increased as the current quarter has progressed, Texas Instruments said.Many of the largest companies in the industry -- Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. among them -- have warned that demand is dropping steeply. But investors have been hoping that the industry is nearing a low point.Though the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index lost 40% of its value in 2022, it climbed seven days in a row through Tuesday, suggesting that investors think the industry may have bottomed out.Story continuesTexas Instruments shares have fallen this year as well, though they’ve performed better than most peers. They’re down 14% in 2022, making Texas Instruments the fourth best stock in the index this year.Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said it’s impossible to say whether the current decline in demand is simply customers cutting back to reduce inventory or if there’s deeper concern about the economy.Even when the economy is the steady, “you still have semiconductor cycles,” he said. “Over the last two years I wouldn’t be surprised if customers have built too much inventory. Now we’re going the other way.”Third-quarter net income rose to $2.47 a share, Texas Instruments said. Revenue climbed 13% to $5.24 billion. The company had posted double-digit percentage increases for six straight quarters coming in to Tuesday’s results.One of the pioneers of the chip industry, Texas Instruments is the largest maker of analog and embedded processing chips, which go into products as varied as factory equipment and space hardware. Such chips generally require less advanced production than Intel Corp. processors or other digital products. That focus has allowed Texas Instruments to become one of the most profitable companies in the industry and to devote its cash to dividends and share buybacks.Texas Instruments’ management typically refuses to give predictions about future demand for electronics, outside of its basic forecasts. Executives have argued that, while there will always be fluctuations in the semiconductor industry, its chips have lasting value.Unlike digital semiconductors such as microprocessors, Texas Instruments’ products take years to become obsolete, meaning that accumulating inventory in times of weaker demand isn’t the danger sign that it is for other chipmakers.The company ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of inventory, up from $1.86 billion at the same point a year earlier. Lizardi said that increase still leaves the company with a smaller stockpile than it’s aiming for. Texas Instruments could further increase inventory by as much as a billion dollars.Texas Instruments manufactures about 80% of its chips in its own factories, and the company is expanding that footprint. It has said that will result in higher levels of capital spending over the next couple of years, causing some analysts to express concern that the expenditures will crimp its budget for buybacks.Unlike peers, Texas Instruments has no plans to reduce capital spending or slow the buildout of new plants, Lizardi said.(Updates with additional CFO comments starting in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekStudent Debt Headaches Return for Millions Despite Biden ReliefWhat the Alzheimer’s Drug Breakthrough Means for Other DiseasesThe Fantasy of Instant Delivery Is ImplodingFrom Bedrooms to Kitchens, Europe Ponders How Cold Is Too Cold10 Takeaways From Matt Levine’s ‘The Crypto Story’©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents per share, suggesting a decrease of 80.3% from the year-ago quarter’s levels.Western Digital expects non-GAAP revenues between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.63 billion, indicating a decline of 28.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.5%, on average. In the past year, shares of WDC have lost 38.6% of their value against the industry’s decline of 29.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to Note Ahead of Q1 ReleaseWestern Digital’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by the company’s robust product portfolio, especially new product ramps in HDD and flash, amid investments in digital transformation by business enterprises. Strong cloud data center demand is expected to have acted as a tailwind.The company’s energy-assisted drives (18 and 20 terabytes) and the company’s second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs have been witnessing strong demand from cloud providers and big enterprise OEMs.  The company’s innovations in OptiNAND and SMR to drive its capacity enterprise business are expected to have benefited its performance.  The company’s WD Black product line is expected to have witnessed incremental adoption as gamers move toward more customized gaming solutions.Coming to the product group, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flash revenues is pegged at $1.631 billion. Amid the macroeconomic weakness and customers right-sizing their inventory, Flash revenues are likely to have gained from higher demand for second-generation NVMe enterprise SSDs and the ramp-up of new 5G phones incorporating the company’s latest BiCS5 flash solutions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter hard disk drive (HDD) revenues is pegged at $1.961 billion. HDD revenues are expected to have been negatively impacted by declines in consumer and client segments.Weakness in macroeconomic conditions, persistent supply chain troubles and component shortages witnessed globally are likely to have affected the company’s performance in the quarter to be reported. Also, a broad-based decline in retail products across HDD and Flash business is expected to have been a headwind.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in the third quarter of the calendar year 2022 are likely to have negatively impacted HDD sales in the company’s performance in the quarter under review.Higher costs associated with ramping up next-generation energy-assisted hard drives and increasing supply chain-related expenses amid stiff competition in the disk drive market might have dented fiscal first-quarter profits.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Western Digital this time around.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.63%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.07%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3%.Coming into today, shares of the insurance company had gained 14.83% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector gained 1.89%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.94%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Unum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 1, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.40, up 35.92% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.98 billion, up 0.51% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.13 per share and revenue of $12.04 billion, which would represent changes of +40.92% and +0.87%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Unum should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

24,41e5d322-405f-321c-8a35-ffbd1ef54f7f,UNM,2022-10-26,Unum (UNM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-reports-next-week-140202904.html,1666706522,STORY,"['UNM', 'AFL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Unum (UNM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +35.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.98 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum?For Unum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Unum would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.91, delivering a surprise of +55.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Unum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Aflac (AFL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -20.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.63 billion, down 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Aflac has been revised 0.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.21%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

26,616809c1-1850-3aa6-84b5-70e304cb980e,STT,2022-10-26,10 Biggest ETF Companies in USA,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-etf-companies-usa-153040373.html,1666711840,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'JPM', 'STT', 'SCHW', 'BLK']","[In this article, we will take a look at 10 of the biggest ETF companies in the USA. If you want to see more of the biggest ETF companies in the USA, go directly to 5 Biggest ETF Companies in USA.ETFs have risen in popularity recently.Global ETF assets have increased from $3.4 trillion in 2016 to over $10 trillion in November of 2021. According to a January 26, 2022 PwC report, there's a lot more growth in the future too,""However, given global ETF AuM growth of 22% over the last five years ending December 2020, combined with record inflows, new entrants, innovative products and distribution opportunities, we believe that a projection of over USD 20 trillion global ETF AUM by 2026 can be achieved, representing a 17% CAGR over the next five years.""There are several reasons for ETFs' popularity.ETFs can be low cost. In terms of actively managed mutual funds, the expense ratio can be between 0.5% of assets every year to 1.5% of assets every year. In comparison to actively managed mutual funds, most passive ETFs cost less.When picked correctly, ETFs can offer diversification and some ETFs also have a long history of success as well. While many ETFs do not do as well because they cover sectors that don't do very well, some ETFs have done well in the long run. One such example is biggest ETF of all, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF.According to its data, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, as of September 30, 2022, has averaged an annual return of 11.56% in terms of its NAV over the last 10 years. Moreover, The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF's performance tracks closely to its intended benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 index, which has had average annual returns of 11.7% over the last 10 years as of September 30, 20222022Given the market decline this year, however, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is down almost 24% year to date as of September 30, 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the financial markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates five times this year given the high inflation. Given the higher interest rates, the probability of a recession has increased substantially as a result. Some economists think that the odds are over 60% while others think it's even higher.Story continuesBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) explains its thinking on the events and its potential effects,""In the Great Moderation, a period of steady growth and inflation, central banks would have eased policy on signs of contracting growth. That era is over. Now central banks are set to induce recessions by overtightening policy. In this supply-driven recession, high inflation and rising rates may break the fragile equilibrium where investors tolerated surging debt loads and forwent a higher term premium, or compensation for the risk of holding long-term bonds.""Due to the headwinds, many asset classes have fallen substantially year to date. Emerging market equities, U.S. equities, global high yield, U.S. 10 Year Treasury, European equities have all fallen more than 10% year to date and in some cases more than 20%. Given the poor performances, ETFs have experienced headwinds as lower asset prices mean less fees.Nevertheless, there still have been inflows to ETFs despite the challenging market.Director of ETF Research and Analytics Elisabeth Kashner commented, ""First half 2022 flows of $332 billion exceed full-year levels for every year from 1993-2016, nearly match full-year 2018 and 2019 flows, and equal 64% of full-year 2020 flows.""Financial Companies That Have BenefitedIn terms of the companies that have benefited from the rise of ETFs, ETF issuers are among the chief beneficiaries.Given the U.S. economy is the largest in the world and the U.S. dollar is the leading global reserve currency, most of the leading financial companies that issue ETFs are based in the USA. Some, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) are also listed on the NYSE.Although the financial companies don't make as much revenue as mutual fund companies do from their assets, the sheer amount of assets can still make offering ETFs profitable for the largest financial institutions.The following are 10 of the largest ETF issuers based in the USA.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 10 from Statista's Largest providers of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States as of July 2022, by assets under management list.10 Biggest ETF Companies in USA10. VanEckETF Assets Under Management: $51.93 billionVanEck is an innovative U.S. asset manager. VanEck was one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer American investors access to international markets and the company also recognized early the transformative potential of ETFs. As a result, VanEck is one of the 10 biggest ETF companies in the USA today with ETF assets under management of almost $52 billion.Like VanEck, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) are among the biggest ETF companies in the USA.9. ProSharesETF Assets Under Management: $57.68 billionProShares has been at the forefront of the ETF revolution since 2006 as it has a broad portfolio of ETFs that allow investing in dividend growers, thematic investing, ex-sector investing and more. Ex-Sector investing in certain ETFs allows investors to tailor the S&amp;P 500 by making it simple to underweight or even exclude one sector from a portfolio. This could be useful if an investor believes one sector will underperfrom another sector in the future. As of July 2022, ProShares had ETF Assets Under Management of almost $57.7 billion.8. World Gold CouncilETF Assets Under Management: $66.46 billionAccording to the Wall Street Journal, ""The World Gold Council, a group funded by mining companies, sought to revive gold demand by making it easier to buy and sell physical metal. They hit upon an ETF, still a relatively obscure investment product at that time. ETFs sell shares and use the proceeds to buy another asset, such as gold or stocks. GLD launched on Nov. 18, 2004 under State Street Corp.’s now-defunct streetTRACKS brand, later renamed SPDR.""As a result of investor interest, World Gold Council has ETF assets under management of $66.46 billion according to Statista. The $66.46 billion could be characterized as part of State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) depending on the exact terms of the ETF.7. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)ETF Assets Under Management: $78.85 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a leading financial institution that does many different things including issuing ETFs.

As of July 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) had ETF Assets Under Management of almost $79 billion.While JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is one of the larger ETF companies in the USA, the bank also offers a lot of other services such as consumer, corporate, and government banking.For its third quarter of 2022, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported net income of $9.7 billion and revenue of $32.7 billion. The company realized an ROTCE of 18% and a CET1 capital ratio of 12.5%. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said,In the U.S., consumers continue to spend with solid balance sheets, job openings are plentiful and businesses remain healthy. However, there are significant headwinds immediately in front of us – stubbornly high inflation leading to higher global interest rates, the uncertain impacts of quantitative tightening, the war in Ukraine, which is increasing all geopolitical risks, and the fragile state of oil supply and prices. While we are hoping for the best, we always remain vigilant and are prepared for bad outcomes so we can continue to serve customers even in the most challenging of times.6. First TrustETF Assets Under Management: $128.98 billionFirst Trust is a U.S. based asset manager that was founded in 1991 that had collective assets under management or supervision of around $193 billion as of August 31, 2022.

It beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 13.00%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson’s fiscal second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $6.13, suggesting a decline of 0.3% from the prior-year quarter. The same for revenues stands at $69.66 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteMcKesson’s fiscal second-quarter results are expected to reflect segmental strength.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment might have acted as a key growth driver in the quarter to be reported. The consensus mark for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $57.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.8% from the prior-year quarter.The segment is likely to have benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, branded-to-generic conversions might have weighed on the segment’s performance. Nevertheless, the company’s broad spectrum of specialty biopharmaceutical providers and manufacturers is expected to have contributed to the fiscal second-quarter performance.Growth and improvement in the primary care business and contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program are likely to have positively impacted the company’s Medical-Surgical solutions segment.McKesson’s collaboration with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort highlighted the company’s role in the COVID-19 response. It was selected by the U.S. government as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those vaccines.Story continuesThe company’s U.S. and international distribution businesses have been playing a key role in the pandemic response. Meanwhile, its growing partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts reflects operational excellence and capabilities.In July 2022, the U.S. government renewed the existing COVID-19 vaccine distribution contract. The company continues to reap benefits from its COVID-related programs in Canada and European operations.McKesson Corporation Price and ConsensusMcKesson Corporation Price and ConsensusMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteThese positive developments may get reflected in the fiscal second-quarter results.Continued growth in the Medical-Surgical segment and Prescription Technology Solutions are likely to have benefited the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings Beat LikelyOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for McKesson this time around.

Its earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 2.63%.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 revenues is pegged at $60.51 billion, indicating an improvement of 2.7% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $2.58, suggesting growth of 7.95% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteSustained growth in specialty product sales coupled with overall market growth at this U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment may have favored the fiscal fourth-quarter performance. The commercial COVID-19 treatments recorded lower sales in the third quarter, a trend that is likely to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. With respect to this segment, revenues are expected in the band of $207 billion to $212 billion in fiscal 2022, implying growth of 2-5%. Consequently, this may get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results. Our model suggests fourth-quarter revenues for this segment to be $53.9 billion.In fiscal 2022, operating income at this segment is anticipated between $2.44 billion and $2.48 billion, indicating growth of 8-10%. This, in turn, is likely to get reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter results. Our model predicts the segment’s adjusted operating income to be $592.5 million for the fourth quarter.Apart from this, the International Healthcare solutions segment’s World Courier unit is likely to have exhibited solid performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, World Courier’s impressive track record as an international leader in specialty logistics has enabled AmerisourceBergen to lend support to customers globally despite a challenging COVID-induced environment and additional operational challenges. Moreover, Alliance Healthcare’s products are likely to have driven the top line in the fourth quarter. The company guided full-year revenues for the segment between $26 billion and $27 billion.

(NYSE:TMO) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 12% in that time. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 163% the gain in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 17% drop, in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 27% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Thermo Fisher Scientific the TSR over the last 5 years was 166%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Thermo Fisher Scientific shares lost 17% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 23%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 22%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors.

32,b985a096-d40e-31de-8190-3308e848a1c3,CTAS,2022-10-26,Recent uptick might appease Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) institutional owners after losing 4.2% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-cintas-185828798.html,1666724308,STORY,['CTAS'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 4.2% losses, last week’s 3.1% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cintas. View our latest analysis for Cintas ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cintas?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Cintas does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cintas' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cintas. Our data suggests that Scott Farmer, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 14%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.8% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CintasThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Cintas Corporation. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$6.2b stake in this US$41b business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Cintas. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Cintas , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.63% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.07%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.3%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest retailer had gained 6.17% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.55% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.94% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Walmart as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 15, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.31 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 9.66%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $147.29 billion, up 4.81% from the prior-year quarter.WMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.85 per share and revenue of $600.58 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -9.44% and +4.86%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.06% lower within the past month. Walmart is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Walmart's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.84. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.84, so we one might conclude that Walmart is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.34. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Retail - Supermarkets industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.71 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Supermarkets industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nordstrom (JWN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.15 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.Nordstrom's Earnings ESP sits at 11.48%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13.JWN is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tractor Supply (TSCO) as well.Slated to report earnings on January 26, 2023, Tractor Supply holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.35 a share 93 days from its next quarterly update.Tractor Supply's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.31% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, JWN and TSCO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

I think Adidas will retain some of the sales. They will not lose that $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of Yeezy sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not being branded under that brand as well.""In ending their relationship, Adidas will have a huge hole to fill financially: The popular Yeezy line represents about $1 billion to $2 billion in annual sales for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.A pair of Yeezy shoes from Adidas are seen in a Foot Locker store in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022.

""Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. Adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.""Adidas stock fell 3% on the news and is down about 65% so far in 2022.Adidas noted that it would miss out on $250 million in profits this year as a result of the decision.""This is coming at a tough time for the company,"" Sherman said. ""They had their second of two early earnings releases and guidedowns for the year. They are expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway... and this $250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4.""Aside from the West drama, Adidas is entering into the holiday season wounded as the latest retailer to get caught flat-footed operationally as global economies have slowed. That poor execution has primarily led to a glut of Adidas inventory that will have to be aggressively marked down at the expense of profits, the company warned a week ago.Story continues""The company’s new outlook takes into account a further deterioration of traffic trends in Greater China as well as a significant inventory build-up as a result of lower consumer demand in major Western markets since the beginning of September, which is expected to lead to higher promotional activity during the remainder of the year,"" Adidas stated on October 20.Adidas merchandise in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022.Evercore ISI's Omar Saad believes Adidas shares will be dead money as it works through excess inventory and also searches for a new CEO to replace long-time leader Kaspar Rorsted in 2023.""Adidas has been significantly underperforming in China before and through the pandemic (China sales 55% vs. pre-pandemic levels vs Nike 87%), and that divergence appears to be widening,"" Saad explained.

This compares to FFO of $0.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.10%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.85 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.89, delivering a surprise of 4.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Equity Residential , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry, posted revenues of $695.1 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $623.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Equity Residential shares have lost about 29.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Equity Residential?While Equity Residential has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Equity Residential: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.95 on $704.78 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.52 on $2.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Residential is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 26.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Mid-America Apartment Communities' revenues are expected to be $506.18 million, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Demand remains solid, albeit with slightly more price sensitivity in San Francisco and Seattle than we expected,"" said Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. ""The substantial embedded growth in our rent roll and our financially resilient and highly employable resident base leaves us well positioned to deliver above average results in 2023 despite likely macroeconomic turbulence. Longer term, we will continue to benefit from trends such as high single family housing costs, favorable demographics and an overall deficit in housing across the country.""Recent HighlightsThe Company reported an 11.8% increase in same store revenue for the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021, driven by healthy demand during the primary leasing season. Moderate same store expense growth of 3.5% continued to be driven by favorable real estate tax and payroll expenses.The Company now expects its full year 2022 same store revenue growth to be approximately 10.6%, slightly above its prior midpoint, and has adjusted various guidance ranges as further described in this release and in the Management Presentation referenced below.The Company sold two properties during the quarter for a total sale price of $480.5 million and used the proceeds to pay down $500.0 million in debt due in 2023.The Company recently published its ninth annual Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report highlighting Equity Residential’s goals and accomplishments.Story continuesFull Year 2022 GuidanceThe Company has revised its guidance for its full year 2022 same store operating performance, EPS, FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share as listed below:RevisedPreviousChange at MidpointSame Store (includes Residential and Non-Residential):Physical Occupancy96.4%96.5%(0.1%)Revenue change10.6%10.0% to 11.0%0.1%Expense change3.3%2.5% to 3.5%0.3%NOI change14.25%13.75% to 14.75%0.0%EPS$2.02 to $2.04$1.98 to $2.08$0.00FFO per share$3.49 to $3.51$3.45 to $3.55$0.00Normalized FFO per share$3.52 to $3.54$3.48 to $3.58$0.00The Company has a glossary of defined terms and related reconciliations of Non-GAAP financial measures on pages 28 through 33 of this release.

October 2022 operating metrics are generally consistent with the Company's expectations and are being driven by a more challenging 2021 comparable period and slightly greater price sensitivity in Seattle and San Francisco.Investment ActivityThe Company did not acquire any operating properties during the third quarter of 2022 but did enter into separate unconsolidated joint ventures to develop vacant land parcels in Frisco, Texas (further described below) and suburban Boston at a total cost of approximately $56.9 million. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company acquired a 172-unit apartment property in San Diego, built in 2020, for $113.0 million at an Acquisition Cap Rate of 3.5% as well as the two land parcels discussed above.During the third quarter of 2022, the Company sold a 455-unit apartment property in New York, built in 2001, for $415.0 million at a Disposition Yield of 3.4%, and a 136-unit apartment property in Washington, D.C., built in 1962, for $65.5 million at a Disposition Yield of 4.3%. These two asset sales generated an Unlevered IRR of 4.6%. During the first nine months of 2022, the Company sold three properties for a total sale price of approximately $746.2 million at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 3.4%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 5.3%.Also during the third quarter of 2022, the Company began activity on two unconsolidated projects as part of its joint venture with Toll Brothers. The Company began construction on Lyle, a 334-unit apartment property in Dallas, Texas and entered into a joint venture on Remy, a 357-unit apartment property in Frisco, Texas that began construction in the first quarter of 2022.Capital Markets ActivityIn August 2022, the Company used proceeds from the property sales described above and cash on hand to redeem at par its $500.0 million in 3.0% unsecured notes originally due to mature in April 2023, substantially reducing its 2023 maturities. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company recorded $3.8 million in non-cash write-offs of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing costs which are not included in Normalized FFO.In October 2022, the Company settled all of its outstanding forward equity sales agreements under its At-The-Market (ATM) share offering program, which were entered into during the third quarter of 2021. As a result, it issued 1,740,550 common shares at $80.22 per share and received total proceeds of approximately $139.6 million.Fourth Quarter 2022 GuidanceThe Company has established guidance ranges for the fourth quarter of 2022 EPS, FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share as listed below:Q4 2022GuidanceEPS$0.39 to $0.41FFO per share$0.93 to $0.95Normalized FFO per share$0.94 to $0.96The difference between the third quarter of 2022 actual EPS of $0.86 and the fourth quarter of 2022 EPS guidance midpoint of $0.40 is due primarily to lower expected property sale gains, partially offset by higher expected Residential same store NOI.The difference between the third quarter of 2022 actual FFO of $0.90 per share and the fourth quarter of 2022 FFO guidance midpoint of $0.94 per share is due primarily to higher expected Residential same store NOI.The difference between the third quarter of 2022 actual Normalized FFO of $0.92 per share and the fourth quarter of 2022 Normalized FFO guidance midpoint of $0.95 per share is due primarily to higher expected Residential same store NOI.About Equity ResidentialEquity Residential is committed to creating communities where people thrive.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis water and wastewater treatment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.33 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.95% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xylem?For Xylem, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.88%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xylem will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xylem would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of +20%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xylem doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerBarnes Group (B), another stock in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.48 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -12.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $323.87 million, down 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Barnes Group has been revised 1.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.17%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Barnes Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

XYL is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings has been revised downward by 4.3% in the past 90 days. However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 10.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Xylem this earnings season.Xylem Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseXylem Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseXylem Inc. price-eps-surprise | Xylem Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteStrong underlying demand, supported by large infrastructure projects in the United States and Canada, is likely to have aided Xylem’s third-quarter performance. Pricing actions are expected to have supported the company’s bottom line.The Water Infrastructure segment is expected to reflect higher revenues on the back of effective price realization and healthy activity in wastewater utility business in the United States and Western Europe. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Water Infrastructure segment revenues in the third quarter indicates a 3.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.The Applied Water segment’s performance is expected to have benefited from strong price realization and backlog execution in industrial and residential end markets. The consensus mark for Applied Water segment revenues in the third quarter hints at a 9% jump from the year-ago reported number.However, higher lead times and lower volumes due to supply-chain constraints are likely to have dampened Xylem’s third-quarter performance. Chip supply constraints are expected to have weighed on the Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Escalating cost of sales due to high raw material, labor, freight and overhead costs are likely to have dented Xylem’s bottom line in the third quarter. Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign currency headwinds are expected to have impacted the top line.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Xylem this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: Xylem has an Earnings ESP of -0.88%.

50,933b97c5-d677-31a3-8ac9-62e8ae67d4e0,IT,2022-10-26,Gartner (IT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gartner-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-140202795.html,1666706522,STORY,['IT'],"[Gartner (IT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology information and analysis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.27 billion, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.83% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gartner?For Gartner, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Gartner will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gartner would post earnings of $2.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.85, delivering a surprise of +33.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gartner appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its share of global coal exports reached 17% last year with supply of 223 million tonnes.But now with more exports heading east towards Asia as opposed to west towards Europe, bottlenecks are appearing.""Many of us were informed by the sellers that there will be delays on loading and arrivals, which causes trouble to our business,"" a Chinese coal trader said.Another source said that some traders were simply told by sellers or miners that a coal shipment was cancelled due to the lack of rail capacity and could be delayed for weeks.Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has acknowledged the problem with infrastructure constraints, saying this month that the situation with coal exports and congestion on the rail system had not stabilised, though it was improving.China's coal imports from Russia fell to 6.95 million tonnes last month, down from a peak of 8.54 million tonnes in August, according to China's customs data.According to Russian transport industry sources, Russia has increased coal supplies to China by railways by about a third this year, to 27.6 million tonnes in the January-August period.Story continuesWINTER DEMANDBut the increase in cargo traffic has led to slower deliveries.According to a Reuters analysis, it took about 12.6 days to deliver a coal cargo from fields in Siberia, such as Kuzbass, to Russia's Pacific ports in July-September, compared with 11.3 days on average in the same period last year.On average, delivery time across Russia has increased by a fifth, or 1.4 days, according to Reuters analysis of railway data, and timings may increase in the winter due to the railway congestion and port capacity limitations.""We would expect China's coal imports from Russia to decrease due to the cool weather, which will limit port loading, and the rail logistics cap will also help to put a lid on,"" the Chinese coal trader said.Of Russia's total of 223 million tonnes of coal exports last year, 49 million tonnes were delivered to Europe, according to the Energy Ministry.But Russia now expects its coal exports to decline in coming years due to the Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, and U.S., European Union and British embargos on Russian coal imports.According to Russian government expectations, coal exports may fall by 22% this year and by a further 31% in 2023.But at the same time, the rush of east-bound exports is getting bogged down.""A lot of railcars accumulate, congestion is formed at port stations ... Turnaround times for railcars are increasing significantly. Shippers are looking for empty railcars,"" a Russian transport industry source said.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia plans to increase the capacity of its infrastructure, including that of its eastern ports, where capacity is expected to increase by between 55 million tonnes and 211 million tonnes per year by 2031 from 150 million tonnes now.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.59, or 3%, to $87.91.The U.S. dollar fell 1.2%, making oil cheaper for holders of other currencies. The U.S. greenback has been stronger than other key foreign currencies as the U.S. Federal Reserve has been more aggressive about raising rates. [USD/]""Across the board this is a dollar-denominated move, and if you try to read outside out of that, it’s foolish,"" said Eli Tesfaye, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.U.S. crude stocks rose 2.6 million barrels last week, according to weekly government data, more than anticipated, but that was lower than industry figures, which showed a 4.5 million-barrel build.Crude exports rose to 5.1 million barrels a day, the most ever, dropping net U.S. crude imports to their lowest in history.""Overall, thanks to the export market, this turns into a bullish report despite a medium-sized build in commercial crude inventories,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.Traders attributed the surge in exports to the widened WTI-Brent spread, which, coming into Wednesday's trade, was at more than $8 per barrel.U.S. refining rates remained steady at nearly 89% of capacity, the highest for this time of year since 2018.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries surprised markets with a larger-than-expected cut to its output targets earlier this month. Oil analysts anticipate supply will tighten in coming months after that move, and as Europe is expected next month to ban oil imports from Russia and restrict Russian shippers from the global shipping insurance industry.Story continuesThat ban may tighten world shipping markets, which could also increase the price of oil. Many analysts believe Russia will be able to circumvent the measures, but it could still cause Moscow to shut between 1 million and 2 million barrels of daily production; it could as well hit the distillates markets.""Until 2024 we believe oil price will be strongly influenced by the availability of tankers that are willing to transport Russian oil rather than global supply-demand fundamentals, keeping oil price elevated,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote.(Reporting by David Gaffen; Additional reporting by Laura Sanicola, Shadia Nasralla and Rowena Edwards; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Cynthia Osterman)]"

This compares to earnings of $0.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility company would post earnings of $0.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.FirstEnergy , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.48 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.FirstEnergy shares have lost about 11.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for FirstEnergy?While FirstEnergy has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FirstEnergy: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.53 on $2.92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.43 on $11.92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 46% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Fortis (FTS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 28.This electric and gas utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Fortis' revenues are expected to be $1.8 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: FE) today reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $334 million, or $0.58 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.5 billion. In the third quarter of 2021, the company reported GAAP earnings of $463 million, or $0.85 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.1 billion. GAAP results include special items listed below.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* were $0.79 per share for the third quarter of 2022, at the top end of the company's guidance range. In the third quarter of 2021, operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $0.82 per share and $0.68 per share on a pro forma basis when adjusting for accounting policy changes, Ohio rate credits and equity financing transactions for comparability purposes.""Our continued solid results, together with the ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture, accelerate improvement in our balance sheet and achieve operational excellence, are creating positive momentum at FirstEnergy and positioning us to capitalize on significant opportunities for growth through long-term, customer-focused investments,"" said John W. Somerhalder II, FirstEnergy Board Chair, interim president and chief executive officer. ""I'm confident our leadership team and committed employees will continue to drive these strategies to transform the company into a best-in-class utility.""FirstEnergy updated its full-year GAAP earnings forecast range to $1,145 million to $1,260 million, or $2.01 to $2.21 per share based on 571 million shares outstanding. It also affirmed its full-year 2022 operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range of $1,315 million to $1,430 million, or $2.30 to $2.50 per share based on 571 million shares outstanding and expects results in the upper half of that range, assuming normal weather.Story continuesThird Quarter Results            Third quarter and year-to-date 2022 results reflect the impacts of certain accounting policy changes, rate credits that were provided to Ohio customers under the company's previously approved stipulation, and dilution related to the common equity financing transaction that closed at the end of 2021 and the sale of a minority interest in FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC that closed on May 31, 2022.Excluding the impact of these items, third quarter operating results in the Regulated Distribution business were flat as higher revenue related to capital investment programs primarily in Pennsylvania, along with impacts from weather, offset higher planned operating expenses, including accelerating maintenance work into 2022.Total distribution deliveries were flat compared to the third quarter of 2021, with lower sales in the residential and commercial sectors offset by a 2% increase in industrial sales.In the Regulated Transmission business, third quarter 2022 operating results benefited primarily from the company's ongoing Energizing the Future capital investment program.In the Corporate/Other segment, third quarter 2022 operating results improved as compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher returns on legacy, commodity-based investments and lower interest expense from holding company debt redemptions during 2022.First Nine MonthsFor the first nine months of 2022, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $809 million, or $1.42 per basic share ($1.41 per diluted share), on revenue of $9.3 billion. This compares to GAAP earnings of $856 million, or $1.57 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $8.5 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Results for both periods reflect the impact of special items listed below.Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the first nine months of 2022 were $1.91 per share, compared to $2.10 per share in the first nine months of 2021 and $1.74 per share on a pro forma basis in the first nine months of 2021, when adjusting for the impacts of accounting policy changes, Ohio rate credits and equity financing transactions described above.Results for the first nine months of 2022, as compared to the same period last year, primarily reflect the strength of FirstEnergy's customer-focused investments, investment income and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher planned operating expenses.Consolidated GAAP Earnings to Operating (Non-GAAP) EPS* and 2021 Pro Forma EPS ReconciliationThree Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022 Estimates2022202120222021Full YearEarnings Attributable to FirstEnergy Corp.

The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pre-tax amount if deductible/taxable. The income tax rates range from 21% to 29%. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) is based on 571 million shares for the third quarter, first nine months and full year of 2022 and 544 million shares for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021.Non-GAAP financial measures * Operating earnings (loss) excludes ""special items"" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management uses Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment to further evaluate the Company's performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision making. Operating earnings (loss) per share and Operating earnings (loss) per share for each segment is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes special items as discussed herein, for the periods presented by the number of shares outstanding. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP), as well as Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) for each segment, are based on 571 million shares for the third quarter, first nine months and full year of 2022 and 544 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. Furthermore, pro forma earnings per share are also a non-GAAP financial measure and adjust the 2021 operating earnings (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, for certain accounting policy changes, rate credits and equity financing transactions that took effect or began to impact in 2022, which management believes provides for a more consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses period-over-period. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share, Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment, and pro forma earnings per share provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided, where possible without unreasonable effort, quantitative reconciliations within this presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Investor Materials and TeleconferenceFirstEnergy's Strategic and Financial Highlights presentation is posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks Under $50.Stocks have been sandwiched between inflation and an aggressive Fed. Equity investors are panicking and exiting positions in companies due to lackluster earnings and a weakening macro environment. The Fed is on track to raise interest rates by another 75 basis points in November which is expected to sink equities further. However, some analysts think that the market has already priced this in and investors may be in for a positive surprise.""Santa Claus Rally""Another reason why some analysts see a rally is that, historically, midterm elections have been bullish for stocks. On October 22 Dr. Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, Inc., appeared in an interview on CNBC where he built the bull case for why he sees the market entering a ""Santa Claus rally"" as we move into year-end. Here are some comments from Dr. Ed Yardeni:""I think we're gonna get another Santa Claus rally, and Santa Claus rallies are predictable and strong as a result of midterm elections. It almost really doesn't matter which way the house or the senate go, but midterm elections no matter what have had a tendency to be very bullish and the Santa Claus rally just continues right through the next 3,6, or 12 months...I think at this point, the market knows they're (the Fed) gonna be doing another 75 basis points in early November, and now the market's confused about whether it's gonna be 75 or 50 basis points in December. I thought it was gonna be two 75s, one after the other, but now the Fed is showing some uncertainty about that. I think what the market is looking for is a pause. I don't think they're looking for a pivot, they're looking for a pause. The Fed's been awfully aggressive, 300 basis points so far since March, and now another 75 basis points in November, and I think they will go ahead with another 75 basis points in December. But I think the market knows all of that...""Story continuesInvesting in stocks that trade for under $50 can be a great way to make money in the stock market.

(CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130001870.html,1666702801,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +9.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.1%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 indicates a change of +17.8% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.93 billion and $35.39 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +14.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.34%. The EPS surprise was +16.67%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Salesforce, Inc., UPS and Devon Energy Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Salesforce shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-45.5% vs. -28.2%). This reflects fears in the market about enterprise spending slowdown in response to the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Other headwinds include stiff competition, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver.The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in the enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft's Teams product.

But what sets UPS apart from FedEx and others is a track record of operating excellence and ability to generate strong cash flows. The ability to pass on higher costs to customers through increased shipping rates should help profitability to some extent. Longer term, UPS remains well positioned to capitalize on the favorable outlook for ecommerce growth.In first-half 2022, UPS generated free cash flows of $6,895 million compared with $6,804 million in first-half 2021. UPS paid out dividends worth $3,437 million in 2021, up 1.9% year over year.

67,82f9c234-2cd4-3dfd-89df-456c67ed5a6f,SEE,2022-10-26,Sealed Air (SEE) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sealed-air-see-reports-next-140102598.html,1666706462,STORY,"['SEE', 'SON']","[Sealed Air (SEE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.47 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sealed Air?For Sealed Air, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sealed Air will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sealed Air would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of +3.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sealed Air doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsSonoco (SON), another stock in the Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.43 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +57.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.92 billion, up 35.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Sonoco has been revised 2.6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 4.20%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Sonoco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CRI is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 28, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $857 million, indicating a decline of 3.8% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has been stable at $1.65 in the past 30 days, suggesting a fall of 14.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The branded marketer of apparel, exclusively for babies and children in North America, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.5%, on average. In the last reported quarter, CRI’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.3%.Factors to NoteCarter’s has been witnessing drab sales in the retail segment for a while now. In addition, adverse impacts of supply-chain headwinds, inflation, high ocean freight costs remain a concern. These factors along with a tough year-over-year comparison and the surge in gas prices might have hurt CRI’s performance in the quarter under review.On its last earnings call, Carter’s projected net sales of $850-$865 million for third-quarter 2022. Management had envisioned adjusted earnings of $1.50-$1.70, suggesting a fall from $1.93 reported in the prior-year quarter and an adjusted operating income of $90-$100 million, indicating a decline from $123.9 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.However, strength in its e-commerce business, driven by expanded omnichannel facilities, including curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store and ship from store along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, appears encouraging. Carter's’ mobile app has also been performing well for a while. Also, improved price realization and gains from share repurchases remain tailwinds.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Carter's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here as elaborated below.

The bottom line also plunged 31% from the year-ago quarter figure.Shares of the company have lost more than 4% in pre-market trading. This is largely owing to disappointing quarterly performance. The company lowered 2022 guidance, which also weighed on investor sentiments.Subdued issuance volume was a major headwind, which hurt Moody’s results. A rise in operating expenses posed an undermining factor. However, strategic buyouts strengthened Moody’s Analytics segment’s performance. The company’s liquidity position was robust during the quarter.After taking into consideration certain non-recurring items, net income attributable to Moody's Corporation was $303 million or $1.65 per share, down from $474 million or $2.53 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Down, Costs UpRevenues were $1.28 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion. The top line also declined 16% year over year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by 4%.Total expenses were $873 million, up 1%. The rise was mainly due to operational and transaction-related costs related to the recent acquisitions.

Adjusted operating margin was 39%, down from 48.3% a year ago.Mixed Segment PerformanceMoody’s Investors Service revenues plunged 36% year over year to $590 million. The fall was mainly due to muted capital market activities. Foreign currency translation affected the segment’s revenues by 3%.Moody’s Analytics revenues grew 14% to $685 million. This was mainly driven by the RMS acquisition and steady demand for Know Your Customer solutions and credit research.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.53 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Moody's shares have lost about 37.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Moody's?While Moody's has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

(NASDAQ:ALGN) Shares Could Be 48% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/align-technology-inc-nasdaq-algn-102817930.html,1666780097,STORY,['ALGN'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Align Technology Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$692.5mUS$832.8mUS$1.02bUS$1.21bUS$1.35bUS$1.47bUS$1.56bUS$1.65bUS$1.72bUS$1.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 11.51%Est @ 8.65%Est @ 6.65%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$652US$739US$853US$952US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$977(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.0%) = US$43bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$43b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$33b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$218, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Align Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.894. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.09 billion, up 43.67% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $8.15 billion, which would represent changes of +191.72% and +49.09%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil.

75,6ba20552-f410-3605-8ba3-22f409f2bebe,MRO,2022-10-26,10 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-energy-stocks-buy-opec-123238871.html,1666701158,STORY,"['NG=F', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'GLNG', 'SRE', 'CRK', 'KOS', 'NEX', 'MRO', 'OXY', 'COP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten energy stocks to buy on the OPEC production cuts. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts.  The decision by OPEC+ to cut oil output earlier this month has become a source of friction between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as efforts by the U.S. government to lobby the latter to change its mind prior to the cut went unheeded. The decision, which according to Saudi officials is purely economic in nature, is instead alleged to be based on support for Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and a risk to the global economy as populations all around face record high inflation, caused by high commodity prices.These cuts will only reinforce the need to invest in alternative oil production sources, and given the rising global energy needs, oil will continue to play a crucial role. A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that global energy demand will grow by 47% by 2050, as more populations enter the middle class and improve their living conditions. Natural gas in particular will see rising demand, due to the fuel's clean burning properties, and this demand will cause natural gas consumption to grow by 31% by the end of the forecast period.The EIA focuses next on the U.S., to estimate that oil and gas will remain the dominant fuel sources in the country by 2050. The largest demand will come from the industrial sector, as hydrocarbon gas liquids remain crucial sources of feedstock. Over the coming winter, household energy expenditures will grow due to soaring costs and high expenditures, with the government agency estimating that homes using natural gas, heating oil, electricity, and propane will see their expenditures grow by 28%, 27%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. It also estimates that U.S. crude oil production will grow to 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023, to set a new record high.Commenting on the OPEC+ oil cut, the vice chairman of S&amp;P Global Mr. Dan Yergin explained that the decision is being viewed in Washington as being political in nature - particularly to harm President Joe Biden's campaign for the midterm elections. Mr. Yergin explained to CNBC that:Story continuesI think Hadley what you described, a couple of things are really key, what it's really about a million barrels a day and it doesn't go into effect till November. That's and I think, that basically, it's the R word - recession - that they've been focusing on, if you're listening to the U.S. central bank and others. However, as you point out the interpretation here in Washington is quite different, this is seen as a, first of all a blow against Biden who came to Saudi Arabia. Secondly, it's seen as somehow political, interfering in the U.S. election although the cut doesn't go into effect until November, and the third thing of course is the other R word, Russia, that this is seen as bolstering Russian revenues.Today's piece will take a look at some of the top energy stocks in the industry, with the notable picks being ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).Photo by Jeff W on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe took a broad look at the energy sector and its different constituents such as exploration, production, and transportation, to narrow down to the top 10 companies that are going to benefit from the current market environment. They were then analyzed through their financials and market performance, after which they were ranked through Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.10 Energy Stocks To Buy On OPEC Production Cuts10. Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Comstock Resources, Inc.

The firm has millions of cubic feet of natural gas reserves and thousands of oil wells all over the United States.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) is a huge beneficiary of the soaring natural gas prices, which despite a drop earlier this month, are still up as much as 74% year to date due to the gas shortage in Europe in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company's cash flow jumped by 50% during its first quarter, which then allowed it to become debt-light as it saved $47 million in interest through early debt retirement. By the end of June 2022, Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s free cash flow stood at $190 million for a whopping 578% annual increase.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s shares have also rallied on the market, and year to date they are up by 94%. Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 25 had invested in the company.Out of these, D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw is Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s largest investor. It owns 41 million shares that are worth $49 million.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) joins our list of best energy stocks, with other strong companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).9. Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) is a deep water oil and gas exploration company. The firm is headquartered in Dallas Texas, the United States and it explores oil in the Gulf of Mexico and Ghana, among other regions.Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)'s oil production stood at 62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by the end of June 2022, and based on the current high demand for oil, the firm aimed to increase this to as much as 63,000 boepd by the end of September 2022 and to 67,000 boepd by the end of this year. Berenberg increased the company's share price target to $8.5 from $8.3 in August 2022, citing the firm's strong capabilities to leverage high gas prices.By the end of this year's second quarter, 25 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS).Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)’s largest investor is D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns 10 million shares that are worth $65 million.8. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG), as the name suggests, is a liquefied natural gas company. The firm builds and operates plants for the gasification and regasification of LNG. It owns and operates LNG carriers, floating LNG vessels, and floating regasification units.The aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made LNG king, and one of the beneficiaries will be Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). This is evident from the fact that natural gas charter rates jumped to a record high in October 2022, as the cost to charter a ship in the Atlantic rose to a whopping $397,500 per day. For comparison, the LNG charter rate in the Atlantic was a 'mere' $91,000 last year.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) also benefits from rising oil prices, as its gas liquefaction ship is under a contract that lets it earn $3.1 million each for a $1 price increase in Brent crude oil. Therefore, as the Saudi output cuts push prices higher, Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is in for a windfall.Insider Monkey's June 2022 quarter survey of 895 hedge funds saw 27 investors in the company.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)'s largest investor is William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns 10 million shares that are worth $249 million.Horos Asset Management mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable risk-return setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.”7. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is an energy services holding company that is headquartered in San Diego, California, the United States. The firm provides electricity and gas to tens of millions of Americans and it owns transmission facilities that provide more than 40,000 Megawatts of electricity.Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has signed three contracts this year through which it will meet Europe's intensive demand for LNG.

In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corporation (DHR), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates. The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range. This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary. A case in point is this mornig's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary. With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along. S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st. Story continuesFull year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down. For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Preview article &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's What to Expect from Big Tech Earnings Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Danaher have declined -17.7% over the past year against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry’s decline of -25.4%. High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company’s operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 5.8% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 25% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Starbucks, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Starbucks. View our latest analysis for Starbucks ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Starbucks?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Starbucks already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Starbucks, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Starbucks is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.We can report that insiders do own shares in Starbucks Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.0b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Starbucks (including 2 which can't be ignored) .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.63%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.07%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the food distributor had gained 10.72% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 0.29% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.94% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Sysco as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 1, 2022. On that day, Sysco is projected to report earnings of $0.99 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 19.28%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.63 billion, up 13.23% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.20 per share and revenue of $75.53 billion, which would represent changes of +29.23% and +10.05%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Sysco. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.14% lower within the past month. Sysco is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Sysco has a Forward P/E ratio of 19.42 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 18.13, so we one might conclude that Sysco is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, SYY's PEG ratio is currently 1.77. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Food - Miscellaneous was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.49 at yesterday's closing price.The Food - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 139, putting it in the bottom 45% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Make sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The 2022 Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces® are the result of a collaboration with the Best Practice Institute (BPI), a leadership development and benchmark research company.“Sysco is honored to be recognized by Newsweek’s Most Loved Workplaces,” said Adrienne Trimble, Chief Diversity and Culture Officer. “Our associates are proud to work for the global foodservice leader and appreciate that our Purpose means more than just delivering food and other products. As a Purpose-driven company, our values, including our Commitment to Inclusiveness, align with our associates’ desire to make a difference, not only for our customers, but in the communities in which we operate.”The results were determined after surveying more than 1.4 million employees from businesses with workforces varying in size from 50 to more than 10,000. The list recognizes companies that put respect, caring, and appreciation for their employees at the center of their business model and, in doing so, have earned the loyalty and respect of the people who work for them.“As a result of ‘The Great Resignation,’ more companies recognize the importance of focusing on employee satisfaction to not only attract but retain top talent,” said Nancy Cooper, Global Editor in Chief, Newsweek. “The businesses on this year’s list clearly demonstrated that commitment.”How positive workers feel about their future at the company, career achievement, how much employer values align with employee values, respect at all levels, and the level of collaboration at the firm were the five critical areas measured to gauge employee sentiment. In addition, areas such as inclusion, diversity, equity and belonging, and company response and adaptability to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as return-to-office rules, were identified and analyzed in relation to the five critical areas measured.Story continuesFor more information visit sysco.com.About SyscoSysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home.

94,773aef06-a27d-3e13-98c8-318146e01fc9,SYY,2022-10-26,Sysco (SYY) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sysco-syy-earnings-expected-grow-140102584.html,1666706462,STORY,['SYY'],"[Sysco (SYY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.3%.Revenues are expected to be $18.63 billion, up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sysco?For Sysco, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sysco would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of +2.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sysco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Invest In. Utilities stocks are outperforming the broader market by over 30 percentage points heading into the fourth quarter of 2022. If they continue moving forward with that momentum, utilities would outperform the market by the highest margin since 2000. Absolute returns have been resilient as well. Utilities and energy are the only two sectors with positive year-to-date gains. Utilities have benefited as the market faces recessionary crises, which was also the case during the 2001 and the 2007-2009 recessions. The electric utility industry is pressured by the public, utility commissions, social activists, and the federal government to lower carbon emissions to 50% of the 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve net zero carbon by 2050. There is a significant number of firms who are willing to try this cleaner approach to electricity generation, and some companies are sure they can achieve those targets. CPS Energy President Rudy Garza told Forbes on October 18: “As an evolving utility and industry in transition, we see natural gas as a well-established transition fuel that we can use to maintain near-term generation reliability and gives us time to develop and integrate emerging technologies, including the conversion of natural gas generation to operate on hydrogen fuel, to achieve our goals under the City of San Antonio’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.”There are different estimates about the growth in future electricity demand, but several studies back a general consensus that demand could double by 2050. Although measures to tame inflation through rate hikes have impacted utilities in the third quarter, the sector remains one of the historically best-performing S&amp;P 500 segments.

The short crops in South America boosted U.S. exports, and improved volumes and margins in North American origination. Improved margins in global ocean freight, driven by efficient execution amid dynamic global trade flows powered by solid results in Global Trade. South American origination witnessed improved volumes and margins on higher farmer selling in addition to elevated volumes through the export facilities.Crushing results were sharply higher along with margins on resilient global demand for both the meal and oil. Solid rapeseed margins in EMEA, aided by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations coupled with positive impacts from an insurance settlement, drove results. North American soy crush margins continued to gain from renewable diesel demand. Solid results were partly offset by reduced crush volumes, including impacts of idled facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay.Refined Products and Other results were strong year over year, benefiting from a robust margin environment for refined oils and biodiesel. Solid performance in global refined oils was led by healthy demand and higher refined oil margins despite supply-chain headwinds.

The Human Nutrition unit gained from solid demand for plant-based proteins, a robust performance in texturants and strength in Specialty Ingredients. Animal Nutrition results were weaker than the year-earlier quarter’s level. Pet results were down in Latin America due to soft volumes, partly offset by sturdy volumes and margins in North America. Weak animal protein demand adversely impacted feed volumes.Other FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,099 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,559 million and shareholders’ equity of $24,029 million.

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled ""Important information"" at the end of this announcement and in the offer document, which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled ""Special notice to shareholders in the United States"" at the end of this announcement.On May 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (""PMHH""), an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (""PMI""), announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (""Swedish Match"") to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the ""Offer""). An offer document regarding the Offer was made public on June 28, 2022 (the ""Offer Document"") and a supplement to the Offer Document was made public on July 22, 2022. On October 20, 2022, PMHH increased the price in the Offer from SEK 106 to SEK 116 in cash per share, and announced that it will not further increase the price in the Offer. Today, PMHH announces that PMHH has received all necessary approvals from authorities and that this condition for completion of the Offer has been satisfied. In addition, PMHH is obligated to remind the shareholders of Swedish Match of certain U.S. regulatory requirements, including with regard to PMHH’s right to waive or reduce the acceptance level condition after the acceptance period ends, and reminds the shareholders of Swedish Match of the terms of the Offer.Today, PMHH announces that the European Commission has approved, under the EU Merger Regulation, the proposed acquisition of Swedish Match, subject to PMHH’s divestiture of Swedish Match’s subsidiary SMD Logistics AB following the completion of the Offer. PMHH does not believe that Swedish Match’s earnings and operations will be materially affected by the divestiture and the continued operation of SMD Logistics AB by a third-party outside of the Swedish Match Group. Hence, with respect to the Offer and completion of the acquisition of Swedish Match, PMHH has obtained all necessary regulatory, governmental or similar clearances, approvals, decisions and other actions from authorities or similar, including from competition authorities, on terms which, in PMHH’s opinion, are acceptable. Accordingly, this condition for completion of the Offer has been satisfied.Story continues""We are pleased to have received all necessary regulatory approvals, and believe the best and final price in our revised offer for Swedish Match provides very compelling value for the shareholders of both Swedish Match and PMI,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of PMI. ""The revised offer retains a 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to capture the full potential of the combination. Should the offer fail, we are well prepared to proceed autonomously to develop IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio in the U.S.""The acceptance period for the Offer expires on November 4, 2022. All other conditions for completion of the Offer are still applicable to the Offer as set forth in the Offer Document.Reminder of certain terms of the Offer and required reminder of certain U.S. regulatory requirements, including with regard to PMHH’s right to waive or reduce the acceptance level condition after the acceptance period endsAs stated in the Offer Document, completion of the Offer is conditional upon, inter alia, the Offer being accepted to such extent that PMHH becomes the owner of shares representing more than 90 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Swedish Match (on a fully diluted basis)3 (the ""acceptance level condition""). PMHH has reserved the right to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions set out in the Offer Document (including, with respect to the acceptance level condition, to complete the Offer at a lower level of acceptance).The acceptance period under the current Offer timetable expires on November 4, 2022. To satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements, PMHH is obligated to announce the possibility of any waiver or reduction of the acceptance level condition via a press release issued at least 5 business days prior to the end of the acceptance period (i.e., October 28, 2022, under the current Offer timetable). While as of today there has been no decision to reduce or waive the acceptance level condition, with the purpose of satisfying U.S. regulatory requirements, PMHH hereby reminds the shareholders of Swedish Match that it may (but is not obligated to) reduce or waive the acceptance level condition after the expiration of the acceptance period on November 4, 2022, and complete the Offer at a lower level of acceptance. In the event of such a reduction or waiver, (i) PMHH would not reduce or waive the acceptance level condition below 50 percent of the total number of registered shares in Swedish Match and (ii) PMHH would grant an additional acceptance period of at least 5 business days from announcement of the waiver of the acceptance level condition, whereby the Offer is declared unconditional.In compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, PMHH informs the shareholders of Swedish Match that if they have already tendered their shares in the Offer, but their willingness to tender will be affected by a possible reduction or waiver of the acceptance level condition as described herein, they should withdraw their tenders immediately, but in any event, before the expiration of the acceptance period on November 4, 2022. To be valid, such withdrawal must have been received in writing by Handelsbanken Issue department (address: Handelsbanken Capital Markets, Offerings &amp; Issue Services, SE-106 70 Stockholm, Sweden) not later than 17.00 CET on the last day of the acceptance period on November 4, 2022.

Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.79 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.8%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.62 indicates a change of -3% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -8.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.92 billion and $29.28 billion estimates indicate -4.7% and -2.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.16%. The EPS surprise was +10.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

111,d2952298-1cbc-3abf-b071-2194d9f1434a,WU,2022-10-26,Western Union (WU) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-wu-expected-beat-140102502.html,1666706462,STORY,"['WU', 'DBD']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Western Union (WU) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis money transfer company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.09 billion, down 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Union?For Western Union, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Western Union will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Western Union would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of +24.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Western Union appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Diebold Nixdorf (DBD), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.19 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -44.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $933.86 million, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Diebold Nixdorf has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 84.21%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Diebold Nixdorf will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:HCA) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 15x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.HCA Healthcare could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on HCA Healthcare will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The Low P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like HCA Healthcare's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 8.7%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 83% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 10% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% per year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it odd that HCA Healthcare is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From HCA Healthcare's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that HCA Healthcare currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the outlook. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than HCA Healthcare.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this toy maker would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of 260%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Mattel , which belongs to the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, posted revenues of $1.76 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.76 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Mattel shares have lost about 8.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Mattel?While Mattel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Mattel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.46 on $1.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.45 on $5.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Toys - Games - Hobbies is currently in the bottom 17% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 7.This publisher of ""Grand Theft Auto"" and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%.

So let's take a look at some of the top trending tickers here. We have Alphabet, Microsoft, Spotify, Mattel, and Texas Instruments. Let's kick it off with Alphabet. You're looking at shares decline here after hours. The company missing on both the top and the bottom lines. YouTube ad revenue falling during the quarter to $7.1 billion. The estimate on the Street was for $7.4 billion, off nearly 6% after-hours. Year to date, shares off 27%.Moving on to Microsoft, that stock under pressure as well, despite beating on the top and bottom lines. What Wall Street is focused on is that cloud revenue growth. That disappointed during the quarter. That softer than expected cloud revenue weighing on shares here. Azure revenue growth of 35% was down from 40% in the previous quarter. Taking a look at the Intelligent Cloud business overall, revenue there totaling $20.3 billion. Microsoft shares off nearly 1.7% now in extended trading. Year to date, off 25%.Taking a look at Spotify, you see shares selling off there after-hours. Weaker than expected forecast for fourth quarter gross margin. That's what's weighing on the stock, with shares off just around 6%. Third quarter numbers, revenue coming in line. 21% growth on a year over year basis. Monthly active users a key number here, 456 million. That's up 20% year over year and better than expected. Despite that, though, stock off 6%. Over the past three months, you're looking at a drop of just around 12%. Year to date-- let's pull it up there-- off 58%.Taking a look at Mattel, another decliner here after-hours. Shares off nearly 5%. Lower full year profit guidance. Larger hit from the stronger dollar. That is weighing on the stock here. For a third quarter, sales were flat. Profit also declined, concerning here as we head into the very important-- as we are in the very important holiday sales period. Taking a look at year to date, stock off just around 8%. Comparing that to the broader market, Mattel has actually fared relatively well.And rounding it out with Texas Instruments here, you can see the stock off just around 5%. Fourth quarter revenue and EPS guidance coming in light. The company saying that they see weakness broadened into the industrial market. They expect most markets to decline sequentially there. Obviously, that's reflected in the after hours moves. Inventory below desired level. Also see order cancellations increasing during the current quarter. Taking a look year to date, you see Texas Instruments off just around 14%. Extended trading after these numbers broke. Shares off about 5%, Dave. A lot of losses here across the board.DAVE BRIGGS: A lot. Google Cloud probably the winner of the day, if you've got to pick one, I suppose. A huge earnings afternoon today. A big earnings day on tap tomorrow as well, with Boeing, Ford, and Meta all reporting.]"

The bottom line improved 5% year over year and came above the company’s guidance of $2.80 per share.The upside was primarily driven by higher prices and mix in both the Packaging and Paper segments, lower interest expenses, reduced share count as well as a lower tax rate. These gains were somewhat offset by elevated freight and logistics expenses, higher operating and converting costs as well as scheduled outage expenses. The company witnessed lower volumes in both segments.Including special items (primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities) earnings in the reported quarter were $2.80 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s $2.63 per share.Packaging Corporation of America Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePackaging Corporation of America Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePackaging Corporation of America price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Packaging Corporation of America QuoteOperational UpdateSales in the third quarter rose 6% year over year to $2,126 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,208 million.The cost of products sold was up 8% year over year to $1,607 million in the second quarter.

Packaging Corp stated that it will run the containerboard system accordingly, to match supply with demand.In the fourth quarter, PKG plans to complete the scheduled annual maintenance outage at the Jackson, AL mill as well as the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher, and the company expects operating costs, primarily labor and benefit expenses to be higher as well in the fourth quarter. Colder weather is expected to lead to higher energy costs.PKG expects the box plants to have four fewer shipping days in the fourth quarter, and we also expect a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products as well as lower average export containerboard prices. In the Paper segment, the company will continue to implement the price increase that took effect in September.Volume is anticipated to be lower from the third quarter, which has been seasonally strong.

131,8e750e02-5b0c-3231-8e40-c088b7c86fa9,AIG,2022-10-26,Analysts Estimate American International Group (AIG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-american-international-group-140102107.html,1666706462,STORY,['AIG'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when American International Group (AIG) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.5%.Revenues are expected to be $11.5 billion, down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.04% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American International Group?For American International Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -27.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American International Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American International Group would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.19, delivering a surprise of -3.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American International Group doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +56.6%.Revenues are expected to be $35.26 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.57% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Phillips 66?For Phillips 66, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Phillips 66 will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Phillips 66 would post earnings of $5.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.77, delivering a surprise of +14.36%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Phillips 66 doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Maxx, Marshalls and other stores had gained 14.71% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.55% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.94% in that time.TJX will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.80, down 4.76% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.27 billion, down 2.08% from the year-ago period.TJX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $49.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +9.12% and +2.55%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for TJX. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. TJX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, TJX is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 22.24. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.82.Story continuesWe can also see that TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.12. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TJX's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.06 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Discount Stores industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 216, which puts it in the bottom 15% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corporation (DHR), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates. The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range. This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary. A case in point is this mornig's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary. With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along. S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st. Story continuesFull year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down.

High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company’s operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes. Adverse foreign currency movements are affecting Danaher’s top line.However, strong segmental performances are driving Danaher’s growth. Robust activity in bioprocessing and strength in instrument business are boosting the Life Sciences unit’s performance. Robust growth in Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics is acting as a catalyst to the Diagnostics segment’s growth. Inorganic activities are contributing to the company’s top line growth. Danaher’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Comcast shares have declined -42.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -47.0%. The company is persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.Though Comcast is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base. Slowing broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.Nevertheless, Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have underperformed against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -13.5%). The company’s performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. The company believes that performance will be under massive pressure for the rest of the year.However, Starbucks has been benefiting from operating fundamentals such as a solid global footprint, successful innovations and digital offerings. North America comps continue to impress investors.For fiscal 2023 to 2025, Starbucks anticipates global and U.S. comparable store sales growth between 7% and 9% year over year.

143,5eac734e-7aab-372f-8e61-31114fcc7c65,AMGN,2022-10-26,Investors Heavily Search Amgen Inc. (AMGN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-amgen-inc-130001458.html,1666702801,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +15.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.51 points to a change of +2.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.01 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.8%. The $26.14 billion and $27.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.6% and +4.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1%. EPS of $4.65 for the same period compares with $4.38 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont?For Newmont, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newmont will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.46, delivering a surprise of -23.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Newmont doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, Silica Holdings (SLCA), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +272.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $415.17 million, up 55.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Silica Holdings has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Silica Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

145,f6fc9f30-a9a2-3fb4-8289-8bff274a9ca9,PEG,2022-10-26,Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) investors are sitting on a loss of 11% if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/public-enterprise-group-nyse-peg-124813477.html,1666702093,STORY,['PEG'],"[It's understandable if you feel frustrated when a stock you own sees a lower share price. But sometimes broader market conditions have more of an impact on prices than the actual business performance. The Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) is down 14% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -11% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 23%. Looking at the longer term, the stock is down 11% over three years. Even worse, it's down 12% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year Public Service Enterprise Group saw its earnings per share drop below zero. Buyers no doubt think it's a temporary situation, but those with a nose for quality have low tolerance for losses. We hope for shareholders' sake that the company becomes profitable again soon.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Public Service Enterprise Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Public Service Enterprise Group's TSR for the last 1 year was -11%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Public Service Enterprise Group shares lost 11% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 6% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Some major industry players like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Teledyne Technologies TDY are set to reveal their Q3 numbers tomorrow.Factors that Influenced Aerospace &amp; Defense StocksGrowing global air travel demand, driven by a steady recovery in the domestic space as well as improving trends observed in international air travel, is expected to significantly boost the Q3 results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation. Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 31.8% in its commercial shipments during the third quarter. With Boeing being the largest jet maker in the nation, we expect the Q3 results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.Stocks in this industry that are more focused on combat must have gained as a result of steady government support. Moreover, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with improving delivery trends in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends are projected to have bolstered Q3 revenues of aerospace and defense stocks.However, persistent headwinds like supply chain disruption along with some unfavorable project timing as the result of coronavirus might have an adverse impact on the Q3 bottom line of the industry.Q3 ProjectionsAerospace sector Q3 earnings are expected to slip 0.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while revenues are projected to improve 8.2%.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.Aerospace &amp; Defense Stocks to WatchLet's take a look at three defense companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 26 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Story continuesBoeing’s third-quarter deliveries reflected a solid 31.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure, while defense deliveries declined 2.7%. Such mixed delivery numbers from manufacturing companies like Boeing are likely to contribute moderately to the jet maker’s overall third-quarter results.Strong cargo markets with several Boeing-converted freighter and materials management agreements must have added an impetus to the company’s Q3 revenues. However, the discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement since the second quarter might have impacted BA’s government service revenue profile, thereby partly hampering its overall performance in Q3 (read more: Rise in Aftermarket Service to Aid Boeing in Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

While increased air travel demand is projected to have boosted Aerospace unit’s performance, increased demand volume for shipbuilding is expected to have benefited the Marine Systems segment. Increased revenues from U.S. Stryker wheeled combat vehicles are anticipated to have benefited the Combat Systems unit, while strong order activity might have boosted the performance of the Technologies segment.However, the shortage of chips may have continued to plague the company’s ability to deliver certain products in the third quarter as well, thereby partly impacting overall results.General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of -0.41% and a Zacks Rank #3 (read more: Will Segment Sales Aid General Dynamics Q3 Earnings?).General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation price-eps-surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteTeledyne’s Q3 results are likely to reflect solid segmental performance from the majority of its business units.

How this affects the economy and you.",USA TODAY,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/94d5e33a-0a25-3859-ac26-061793e96c48/diesel-supply-dwindles%2C-with.html,1666733995,STORY,"['CL=F', 'HO=F']","[Prices at the pump are in focus again, but this time, it’s the other pump – the diesel fuel pump. Diesel is the fuel trucks, trains and ships fill their tanks with to move goods closer to our homes and stores.While the national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline we put in our cars has dropped about 24% from their record high in June, the price of diesel has only slipped 8%.Diesel prices used to be lower than gasoline, but that relationship has flipped over the years, and the spread between the two has widened and is likely to balloon this winter with diesel prices expected to surge, analysts said.Diesel is the main fuel used to power trucks, rails and vessels that transport all sorts of things from food to home goods to holiday gifts across the country. So, if diesel prices soar, there’s a good chance the price of all those items will, too.“The public are apoplectic when gas rises, but diesel has incredible impacts to inflation in the form of freight costs and surcharges,” Tom Kloza, Opis global head of energy analysis, said. Why are diesel prices so high?Supply and demand.""Supply is constrained partly because Russian imports into the U.S. are banned but also because U.S. refining capacity has fallen over the past few years,” Andrew Hunter, Capital Economics senior economist, said.U.S. inventory stood at 106.2 million barrels of distillate, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, in the week ended Oct. 14, the Energy Information Administration said. That’s about 20% below the five-year average and equates to about a 26-day supply.Because diesel fuel is similar to heating oil, demand’s about to rise due to home heating this winter. “This is concerning,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis oil and refined products analyst at GasBuddy.com.“Between now and the end of November, if we don't build inventories, the wolf will be at the door,” Kloza said. “And it will look like a big ugly wolf if it’s a cold winter.”Story continuesIngrid Brown tops off her tanks with 92 gallons of diesel at a truck stop in Yuma, Arizona. She's headed east with a load of produceHow high could diesel prices climb?Diesel reached a record high of $5.816 per gallon in June, according to AAA, and Kloza said prices could challenge that in coming months or go even higher if winter’s colder than expected or Europe’s energy crisis “blows up.”It’s not just the U.S. seeing a supply crunch. The market is global, and global inventories are at the lowest since 1982 when the world had approximately 3.5 billion fewer people, Kloza noted.“There's a real threat something in the energy chain will go parabolic, and I think generally, the worry is that something that goes parabolic is diesel and heating oil,” he said, noting the time frame to watch closely is the dead of winter, from Dec. 15 to Feb. 15. Capping prices: G-7 nations move closer to price cap for Russian oil; US official says group eyes Putin's cash flowGassing action: Biden orders release of 15 million barrels from reserve aiming to reduce gas pricesWhat can consumers expect if diesel prices continue to rise?Soaring heating bills. Diesel isn’t as front and center as gasoline, but people “will be reacting to it soon,” Kloza said. “Those bills are in the mail.” He estimates some northeast home heating bills will run into the thousands of dollars. “I would buy sweaters,” he said.Already cold: More than 20 million Americans are behind on their utility billsGas prices edge up: Why gas prices are ticking back up and why that's a problem for Biden and the DemocratsBut De Haan says because diesel prices have been high for some time, consumers shouldn’t be too shocked.“Prices didn't shoot up overnight,” he said. “It’s been months, so it’s already hit grocery store shelves in the form of higher prices. I don't think there will be another jump, but prices will stay above normal.”Hunter also said he expects high diesel prices will be offset by lower prices in other areas of the supply chain. “Unless the current diesel shortage gets much worse, I wouldn’t expect that to be enough to outweigh the disinflationary impact of the significant easing of pressures we’re seeing elsewhere,"" such as in global shipping costs, easing labor and component shortages, he said.Can diesel prices be stopped?A big boost to inventories would help, but that’s unlikely, analysts say.“Globally, there’s not enough refining capacity,” De Haan said.There are ways to make diesel from soybeans and other renewables, but the primary way is to refine crude oil and it’ll be hard to stock distillate because of scheduled maintenance that temporarily shuts down refineries.Recession ahead: Economist explains why recession is likely unavoidable in the U.S.Delaying payment: More people are paying for groceries with buy now, pay later apps as inflation pinchesThe other option would be to lower demand, which might include shivering through the winter. Even that may not be enough, but a recession might be.“We are now forecasting the U.S. and global economies to fall into recession over the next few quarters so, it probably won’t be too long before we see easing demand start to take some of the heat out of diesel and crude oil prices,” Hunter said.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Dwindling US diesel supply could keep inflation and heating bills high]"

(NYSE:ZTS) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Zoetis has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Zoetis peKeen to find out how analysts think Zoetis' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Zoetis' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Zoetis' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 10%. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 56% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% each year during the coming three years according to the twelve analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.4% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Zoetis is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Zoetis' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Zoetis maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  Zoetis is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Zoetis.

Though the word might create a bit of unease, there are ways to navigate and adapt to even the most complex energy market conditions, and the best plan begins with a better understanding of the issue.In recent years, we have experienced relative stability in the market with historically low energy prices - and supply often exceeding demand. Following the pandemic and a return to normal daily operations, there has been a fundamental shift with energy prices rebounding in a way that is uncharacteristic. Energy prices are now up, and the natural gas spot price in the United States is at its highest point in the last decade.The recent increase in global energy demand, ongoing supply chain issues, and geopolitical unrest have all contributed to the rise in energy prices. Coupled with extreme temperatures, concerns around increasingly higher energy costs are understandable. High gas prices and regional supply-demand balances seem to be shaping our energy stories, but having a plan can help mitigate the market's impact on you and your business.Taking a Proactive ApproachWhen navigating a high-priced market, it is best not to wait for your energy contract to end before taking action. Understanding the market trends and preparing for higher prices on your next contract is key to not only overcoming uncertainty but also planning for it.Instead of focusing on beating last year's price, it's important to establish a strategy that will manage your risk, move quickly to transact, and be ready to implement your plan, if the market falls.Managed ProductsBusinesses, industry, and government entities have options when the market presents higher energy prices, and managed products are a great place to start. Our managed products alleviate the risk of locking in all of your load at one point in time - when energy prices could be overvalued - and come with a dedicated energy strategist to provide strategic assistance. Designed with market volatility in mind, managed products provide customers with the flexibility and tools needed for risk management to achieve savings through their energy procurement strategy.Story continuesCompared to fixed-price solutions that offer little flexibility, managed products offer benefits such as risk tolerance and budget management to help you make the right decisions for your business. Our managed products such as PowerPortfolio® and GasPortfolio® offer medium to large-scale customers the ability to float the market and minimize the risk of locking into a fixed-price contract at the wrong time.Load Following Block &amp; Index (LFBI) is a great option for smaller scale customers that provides the ability to take advantage of market fluctuations by selecting the percentage of their load to lock in at a fixed-price, with the ability to become fully fixed.Reducing Energy ConsumptionIn addition to our managed products, you may also want to consider an energy solution that will help your business reduce its energy consumption - a simple and effective way to manage costs. NRG has a robust Demand Response program that rewards you for lowering your power consumption during critical peak demand, helping you learn how to use less and ultimately, avoid grid blackouts and brownouts during high energy demand times.With a strategic market approach and understanding of market trends, you can manage your energy costs despite difficult market conditions. As energy markets evolve, they offer opportunities for every customer to make their energy approach a foundational strength of their business. NRG is here to help you navigate market volatility and find the right energy solution for your business.NRG Energy, Tuesday, October 25, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: http://www.nrg.com/sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722227/Energy-Solutions-Designed-for-a-Volatile-Market]"

(NYSE:NEE) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.NextEra Energy hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on NextEra Energy.How Is NextEra Energy's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, NextEra Energy would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 18%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 25% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 38% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.4% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that NextEra Energy's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On NextEra Energy's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that NextEra Energy maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than NextEra Energy.

Also, further weakness in registration from China may have acted as headwinds.Escalating operating expenses related to cybersecurity and infrastructure spending are likely to have weighed on the company’s third-quarter operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Also, ongoing uncertainty prevailing over the global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability in Europe remains a concern.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for VeriSign this time around.

164,623e8858-0287-3b85-99d6-f4ed7b68c347,NEE,2022-10-26,Edison International (EIX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edison-international-eix-expected-beat-140102995.html,1666706462,STORY,"['EIX', 'NEE-PR']","[The market expects Edison International (EIX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electric power provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.99 billion, down 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.02% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Edison International?For Edison International, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Edison International will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Edison International would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.94, delivering a surprise of +4.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Edison International appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, NextEra Energy (NEE) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.35 billion, up 45.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NextEra has been revised 4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.63%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

165,adff49e9-1279-3a9c-9eff-decf1a913de8,NEE,2022-10-26,10 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Invest In,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-electric-utility-stocks-133343568.html,1666704823,STORY,"['EIX', 'DTE', 'XEL', 'AEE', 'EVRG', 'NEE-PR', 'DUK']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best electric utility stocks to invest in. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Invest In. Utilities stocks are outperforming the broader market by over 30 percentage points heading into the fourth quarter of 2022. If they continue moving forward with that momentum, utilities would outperform the market by the highest margin since 2000. Absolute returns have been resilient as well. Utilities and energy are the only two sectors with positive year-to-date gains. Utilities have benefited as the market faces recessionary crises, which was also the case during the 2001 and the 2007-2009 recessions. The electric utility industry is pressured by the public, utility commissions, social activists, and the federal government to lower carbon emissions to 50% of the 2005 levels by 2030, and to achieve net zero carbon by 2050. There is a significant number of firms who are willing to try this cleaner approach to electricity generation, and some companies are sure they can achieve those targets. CPS Energy President Rudy Garza told Forbes on October 18: “As an evolving utility and industry in transition, we see natural gas as a well-established transition fuel that we can use to maintain near-term generation reliability and gives us time to develop and integrate emerging technologies, including the conversion of natural gas generation to operate on hydrogen fuel, to achieve our goals under the City of San Antonio’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.”There are different estimates about the growth in future electricity demand, but several studies back a general consensus that demand could double by 2050. Although measures to tame inflation through rate hikes have impacted utilities in the third quarter, the sector remains one of the historically best-performing S&amp;P 500 segments. To play the boom in utilities, some of the best stocks to consider include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEP), and Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK). Story continuesPhoto by Matthew Henry on UnsplashOur Methodology We selected the following electric utility stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and future growth prospects.

Data released today for August 2022 show that home price gains decelerated across the United States. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller/.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 13.0% annual gain in August, down from 15.6% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite annual increase came in at 12.1%, down from 14.9% in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a 13.1% year-over-year gain, down from 16.0% in the previous month.Miami, Tampa, and Charlotte reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in August. Miami led the way with a 28.6% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 28.0% increase, and Charlotte in third with a 21.3% increase. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending August 2022 versus the year ending July 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -1.1% month-over-month decrease in August, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -1.6%.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.9%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -1.3%.In August, all 20 cities reported declines before and after seasonal adjustments.ANALYSIS""The forceful deceleration in U.S. housing prices that we noted a month ago continued in our report for August 2022,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""For example, the National Composite Index rose by 13.0% for the 12 months ended in August, down from its 15.6% year-over-year growth in July. The -2.6% difference between those two monthly rates of change is the largest deceleration in the history of the index (with July's deceleration now ranking as the second largest). We see similar patterns in our 10-City Composite (up 12.1% in August vs. 14.9% in July) and our 20-City Composite (up 13.1% in August vs. 16.0% in July). Further, price gains decelerated in every one of our 20 cities. These data show clearly that the growth rate of housing prices peaked in the spring of 2022 and has been declining ever since.Story continues""Month-over-month comparisons are consistent with these observations. All three composites declined in July, as did prices in every one of our 20 cities. On a month-over-month basis, the biggest declines occurred on the west coast, with San Francisco (-4.3%), Seattle (-3.9%), and San Diego (-2.8%) falling the most.""Despite the ongoing deceleration, August's housing prices remain well above year-ago levels in all 20 cities. Florida continues to hold the top two spots, with Miami (+28.6%) taking the lead over Tampa (+28.0%). This month, Charlotte (+21.3%) edged out Dallas (+20.2%) and Atlanta (+20.1%) for third position. Price growth continued strongest in the Southeast (+24.5%) and South (+23.6%).""As the Federal Reserve moves interest rates higher, mortgage financing becomes more expensive, and housing becomes less affordable. Given the continuing prospects for a challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to decelerate.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrent Index Level Date Level DateFrom Peak (%) LevelFrom Trough (%)From Peak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %303.76126.7 %64.5 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %310.99132.0 %50.6 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %322.06119.9 %42.3 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for August 2022.

This compares to earnings of $1.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.52%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer credit company would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of 11.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Synchrony , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $3.93 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.66 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Synchrony shares have lost about 28.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Synchrony?While Synchrony has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Synchrony: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.02 on $3.98 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.88 on $15.41 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

180,ee98ee4a-83da-3c33-b3a3-7fb5a70ff5d3,QCOM,2022-10-26,QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) five-year earnings growth trails the stellar shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomms-nasdaq-qcom-five-earnings-130031446.html,1666702831,STORY,['QCOM'],"[QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 22% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 113% return, over that period. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.Since it's been a strong week for QUALCOMM shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, QUALCOMM achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 34% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 10.16.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how QUALCOMM has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of QUALCOMM, it has a TSR of 145% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, QUALCOMM shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 10% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 20% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Following a successful Phase 1 trial in November 2021, the testing for Phase 2 began in Summer 2022, utilizing KULR’s recently implemented bomb calorimeter and leveraging the Company’s technological advancements in PPR energy products for its Advanced Energy Systems.A bomb calorimeter measures the total heat generated in a particular reaction. Data gathered with KULR’s bomb calorimeter can be used in combination with additional information collected from running experiments in the Company’s Fractional Thermal Runaway Calorimeter (“FTRC”), licensed from NASA, for similar cell types. The FTRC supports the determination of both the total amount of heat generated and the fraction of heat contained within the ejecta compared to that retained in the cell body. These compiled datapoints are critical for cell selection decisions and for designing battery systems that are safe against the unique cell level thermal runaway response.In addition to serving NASA and defense contractors, the versatile FTRC also provides significant value to commercial leaning companies that wish to develop better battery pack and battery management system (“BMS”) designs.“Lockheed Martin is a valued KULR customer, and we are encouraged to be jointly proceeding to Phase 2 in developing our PPR energy products for their Advanced Energy Systems,” said Dr. William Walker, KULR’s Director of Engineering. “We are confident our state-of-the-art technological capabilities will meet their needs and lead to a continued, longstanding partnership with one of the leading aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology companies in the world.”Story continuesKULR has developed a multitude of products to increase the performance of aerospace and U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) technologies and is continuing to research new and innovative thermal management and energy solutions.About KULR Technology Group Inc.KULR Technology Group Inc.

PHM reported unimpressive results in third-quarter 2022. Quarterly earnings and revenues missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate thanks to prevailing industry headwinds.Nonetheless, the metrics increased on a year-over-year basis. Shares of this notable homebuilder jumped 0.87% in the pre-market trading session, post release.Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup’s president and CEO, stated, “While we reported significant growth in our third quarter earnings, demand clearly slowed in the period as dramatically higher interest rates created financial and psychological hurdles for potential homebuyers,” said Marshall. “In response to today’s more challenging market conditions, we continue to adjust our sales, construction and investment practices as we work to turn inventory and balance our housing starts to appropriately match the pace of sales.”Inside the HeadlinesEarnings per share came in at $2.69, missing the consensus mark of $2.73 by 1.5% but increasing 47.8% from $1.82 per share a year ago. The upside was driven by gains in revenues, improved gross margin and overhead leverage.PulteGroup, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PulteGroup, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PulteGroup, Inc. Quote Total revenues of $3.94 billion also missed the consensus mark of $4.04 billion by 2.5% but increased 13.4% from the year-ago figure of $3.48 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments — Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 14.3% year over year to $3.87 billion. Home sale revenues of $3.84 billion increased 16% year over year, mainly due to the higher average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues declined 51.4% from a year ago to $30.7 million.The number of homes closed increased 1% from the year-ago level to 7,047 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $545,000, up 15% year over year.Importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 17,053 units, down 14% year over year. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $10.58 billion.However, new home orders dropped 28% year over year to 4,924 units for the quarter, owing to several headwinds like rising mortgage rates, lower affordability, lower consumer confidence and slowed demand. This resulted in a cancelation rate of 24%, up from 10% in the prior year period and 15% in the second quarter of 2022. Home orders were down across all operating regions served. The value of new orders also slipped 8.3% from a year ago to $2.81 billion.Story continuesMarginsHome sales gross margin was up 360 bps year over year to 30.1% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew 410 bps year over year to 21%. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved to 9.1% from 9.6% a year ago.Revenues from the Financial Services segment declined 20.5% year over year to $72.7 million. Pretax income for the segment decreased to $27.5 million from $48.6 million a year ago. The decline was due to a reduction in loan volumes owing to a fall in capture rate to 77% compared with 85% last year and the more competitive pricing environment.FinancialsAt September-end, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) were $291.4 million, down from $1.83 billion in 2021 end. Debt to total capital of 22.5% at third-quarter end was down from 21.3% at 2021 end.In the third quarter, the company repurchased 4.4 million common shares for $180 million at an average price of $41.20 per share.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesPulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

RPM reported impressive results in first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Aug 31, 2022), with earnings and sales surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing on a year-over-year basis.The upside was driven by the continued implementation of MAP operational improvement initiatives, double-digit sales growth across the segments and strong pricing offset supply chain woes, cost inflation, macroeconomic challenges and foreign exchange headwinds.Acuity Brands, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -1.47%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this homebuilder would post earnings of $2.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.73, delivering a surprise of 5.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PulteGroup , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, posted revenues of $3.94 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.49%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.48 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PulteGroup shares have lost about 33.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for PulteGroup?While PulteGroup has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PulteGroup: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.87 on $5.74 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.14 on $16.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Home Builders is currently in the bottom 2% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +43%.Revenues are expected to be $22.74 million, up 45.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 691.89% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MacroGenics?For MacroGenics, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +25.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that MacroGenics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MacroGenics would post a loss of $0.97 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +30.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MacroGenics appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -19.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.77 billion, up 17% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Baxter has been revised 0.4% up to the current level.

It is the first drug of its class to be approved for multiple myeloma.The approval, however, comes with a boxed warning for cytokine release syndrome, a condition where the immune system reacts more aggressively than it should, and neurologic toxicity.While there are other approved therapies for treating multiple myeloma such as Abecma from rival Bristol-Myers Squibb and GSK Plc's Blenrep, many patients see a relapse after stopping treatment, making it an area of significant unmet need that drugmakers can tap into.J&amp;J's treatment received conditional approval from the European drug regulator in August.Though multiple myeloma is rare compared to breast or prostate cancer, it is a common type of blood cancer, which develops in the bone marrow and can spread throughout the body.The cancer is typically diagnosed in people aged between 65 and 74 and affects more men than women, according to the company.According to the American Cancer Society's estimates, close to 35,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are likely to be diagnosed in the United States this year.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important.

203,d333fc7b-08fa-30e5-af8a-bd0264d835ab,WMB,2022-10-26,A Bear Market Rally or Markets Forming a Solid Base: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-market-rally-markets-forming-115211303.html,1666698731,STORY,"['COMP', 'IBKR', '^GSPC', 'WMB', 'INCY', 'LW', 'HUBB']","[Wall Street is witnessing a good rally in October after a horrible September. Historically, several major stock market crashes happened this month. However, this year, it looks like October will see a happy ending.Month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — have advanced 9.7%, 5.9% and 3.6%. On the other hand, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plummeted 13.3%, 20.3% and 30%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are in bear market territory. That is why, financial experts have characterized the ongoing October rally as a bear market rally or a relief rally, similar to the one we saw from mid-June to mid-August.Although market participants are yet to be convinced about bottoming out, October’s rally has some positives. Let’s discuss briefly.Are Markets Trying to Form a Base?U.S. stock markets have seen extreme intraday fluctuations in the past one month. The Dow has recorded around 600-700 points of intraday swing and the Nasdaq Composite has seen 300-400 points of intraday swing. The S&amp;P 500 has registered 50-60 points of intraday swing in the past month. If we consider, pre-market movements of index futures, intraday fluctuations of these three indexes will be much wider.This clearly shows that investors are unleashing both “Sale on the Rise” and “Buy on the Dip” strategies to strengthen their portfolios. Since the market is uncertain about the future movement of the interest rate and Fed’s tightening, investors are taking a short-term view and selling stocks to book quick profits. At the same time, markets are no longer showing a secular downtrend. This means that some sort of sentiments is growing among investors regarding bottoming out.When such a situation arises, the market seems to form a base on which it can ride for the long term growth trajectory. In U.S. stock markets, this type of scenario has been visible in the past month. From here the market can witness a steep rise if a minimum positive clue comes from the Fed. Story continuesOther PositivesLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Fed officials are skeptical about the continuation of the central bank’s aggressive rate hike and tighter monetary control. The officials have already started to express their desire to slow down the pace of rate hikes soon and to stop raising rates altogether early next year. They want to reduce the risk of a hard landing of the economy caused by the policy interventions of the Fed.The Fed has already hiked the benchmark lending rate by 3% in 2022. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate regime takes time to be visible in the economy. A section of market participants led by Ark Investment Management believes that the central bank should not take decisions about the future course of interest rate movement based on lag indicators like nonfarm payrolls and inflation rates.Instead, the Fed should take a decision on lead indicators like declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate. All these lead indicators point to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Stock Selection ProcessAn upward EPS estimate revision for any stock for the rest of 2022 simply means that the market is expecting the company to do good business this year. A positive estimate revision within the last 30 days means that the market is thinking positively about the company.Therefore, a positive EPS estimate revision under growing threats of inflation highlights the solid business model and robust growth potential of a company. Investors can certainly take a look at these stocks that currently have strong earnings momentum.We have narrowed our search to five such large-cap U.S. companies with strong potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three molnths.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Williams Companies Inc.

Jakafi’s label expansion in additional indications is anticipated to further drive sales, and the company has raised the bottom end of full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance.The recent FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream under the brand name Opzelura has diversified the portfolio of Incyte. The uptake of Pemazyre and other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Tabrecta is a positive and should boost sales.

LW saw net sales growth across all three reporting segments. While the macro environment remains volatile, management is on track to deliver results at the high end of the sales and earnings target in fiscal 2023. In addition, Lamb Weston has been keen on boosting production capacity to fuel long-term growth.Lamb Weston has an expected earnings growth rate of 45.7% for the current year (ending May 2023).

They were trading down 9% at $133.53 in afternoon trade.The U.S. planemaker said supply constraints are not expected to get ""much better"" in the near-term and will persist through next year.The Virginia-based planemaker is trying to emerge from overlapping crises - the pandemic and the grounding of its best-selling model after fatal crashes, which have left it with a pile of debt.However, a run-up in costs in its defense contracts along with persistent shortages of parts and labor, and regulatory hurdles has made it tougher to shore up its fortunes.Rising cost pressures over the last few months have hampered fixed-price contracts for U.S. aerospace and defense firms, prompting an industry body to ask the U.S. Congress for inflationary relief.Since these contracts tend to have fixed prices, Boeing is required to absorb cost increases. Analysts at agency Partners estimates the company's various fixed price defense contracts have already resulted in of $8.8 billion of charges.Chief Executive David Calhoun told investors the company is not ""embarrassed"" by the losses on its fixed price defense contracts.Story continues""They are what they are, and we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers,"" he said.Boeing played down investor concerns that these contracts could result in more charges, saying the company was getting closer to finishing them.Some analysts are not convinced, though. Vertical Research analyst Rob Stallard said the company's poor track record in forecasting defense charges raised questions over ""whatever outlook the company provides"".""Boeing management continues to state that the company is in turn around mode, but we'd say that the arc of recovery remains extremely elongated,"" said Stallard, adding the company was lurching from one problem to the next in ""whack-a-mole"" fashion.In a boost for the company, Alaska Airlines said on Wednesday it will buy 52 737 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2027.SUPPLY CONSTRAINTSBoeing said demand for commercial planes remains strong, but tight supplies are hurting production. It further cut estimates for MAX deliveries this year. It now expects to deliver 375 planes this year, lower than an earlier target of ""low 400s.""The company singled out delays in jet engine deliveries as the primary constraint in stabilizing and increasing production rates for 737 jets. It expects the aircraft's monthly delivery trend to remain in the low 30s next year.It called supply chain ""a key watch item"" for the production and deliveries of 787 jets as well.Boeing also faces a late December deadline for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10 under existing rules.After that date, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems to be certified by the FAA, which would mean significant delays for the new MAX aircrafts' deployment unless Congress grants a waiver to extend the deadline.Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said he is confident the planemaker will get an extension from the U.S. Congress of a key deadline to get the planes certified.Boeing retained its forecast of generating cash this year after reporting a free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the September quarter, higher than $1.02 billion expected by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.Adjusted loss per share in the third quarter widened to $6.18 from $0.60 a year ago. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 7 cents a share.Boeing has now fallen short of Wall Street earnings estimates for a fifth quarter in a row.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Kirsten Donovan and Nick Zieminski)]"

Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, and missed in one, the average beat being 20.10%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted Illumina’s third-quarter performance. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs might have weighed on the company's corporate profitability. The existing healthcare staffing challenges and diminishing demand for COVID-testing products might also have weighed on the company through the third quarter.Meanwhile, the extended lockdown issues in limited geographies, including Greater China, where the company has extensive business, are expected to have adversely impacted the top line during the third quarter.In this regard, we apprehend a reduction in COVID surveillance demand pulling back to have a negative impact on revenues in third-quarter 2022. In the second quarter, the significant decrease in mid-throughput shipments was primarily due to headwinds from COVID surveillance and COVID lockdowns in China, with NextSeq 1000, 2000 growth more than offset by a decrease in NextSeq 550.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Over and above, the pending outcome of the European Commission's investigation into Illumina's acquisition of GRAIL, which was initiated in 2020, is putting enormous pressure on the company’s expenses. Other than the uncertainty surrounding GRAIL integration, these regulatory complications are raising legal expenses for Illumina, thereby building pressure on the bottom line. These are expected to have marred the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Story continuesOn a positive note, the ongoing substantial improvement in Core Illumina businesses and contributions from the GRAIL acquisition look encouraging so far. Illumina’s overall sequencing activity on connected instruments is expected to have been robust in the third quarter, on strong sequencing runs in its connected high- and mid-throughput instruments. NovaSeq consumable and instrument shipments in the quarter-to-be-reported are expected to have been promising. The continued strength in the company’s oncology markets is an added advantage contributing to its top line in the third quarter.The company ended the second quarter with a strong backlog of $1.1 billion. A part of this might have been processed in the third quarter, contributing to the sales growth.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, suggesting a 0.4% fall over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 29 cents indicates an 80% slash from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

Labor constraints are making things worse. Nonetheless, the U.S. administration’s focus on infrastructural enhancement has been creating the need for advanced construction and engineering solutions. Also, the companies’ shift toward digital transformation, mergers &amp; acquisitions as well as operational efficiencies should lend support to the industry. Increasing investments in the decarbonization of energy efficiency and energy transition projects also appear to be growth drivers. Overall, the consistent focus on enhancing the infrastructure of the country’s defense, healthcare, communication and renewable energy is encouraging for prominent industry players like Quanta Services, Inc. PWR, KBR, Inc. KBR, ChampionX Corporation CHX, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL and Atlas Technical Consultants, Inc. ATCX.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry primarily consists of engineering and infrastructure service providers. The companies basically provide construction, technical, engineering and professional services to a number of industries worldwide, including oil and gas, chemical and petrochemicals, transportation, mining and metals, power, agriculture, consumer applications as well as manufacturing. The companies also make engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions as well as chemistry solutions along with engineered equipment and technologies for oil and gas companies worldwide.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Engineering - R&amp;D Services IndustryFocus on Defense, Healthcare, Communication &amp; Renewable Energy: The federal government’s investment in defense and cyber security is conducive to the industry’s growth. Owing to the sensitivity of their jobs, the Department of Defense and Homeland Security have the maximum budgets for cyber security among the government agencies. Also, increasing public investments in transportation, water infrastructure, utility plants and the healthcare market are anticipated to be conducive to the industry’s growth. Additionally, the infrastructure services business of the industry players continues to thrive, supported by robust demand from the communications industry.The companies are well-positioned to gain from the renewable energy drive of the pro-environmental Biden administration. The development and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, should benefit the companies going forward. Also, the players are gaining from the rising global demand for alternative nuclear energy as they provide engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance services to nuclear power plants.Need for State-Of-The-Art Services: Increasing construction activities in U.S. government projects, which require state-of-the-art construction and engineering services, are expected to benefit the construction and engineering services industry. Also, the rapid usage of advanced technologies to deliver smart buildings and mega-projects while identifying and checking margin contraction and costs are expected to be a major tailwind for the industry participants.Supply-Chain Disruptions, Labor Shortage, Uncertain Economic Conditions &amp; Competition: The companies continue to face high input costs and labor constraints. Apart from this, supply chain disruption is a major cause of worry. As the impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues, uncertain global economic conditions may put pressure on the demand for services provided by the industry players. Meanwhile, the companies face intense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry, hurting their contract prices and profit margins. Volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the industry’s commodity-based business lines pose significant challenges too.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Engineering – R&amp;D Services industry is a 21-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it at the bottom 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a tepid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential.

216,0d0c1d97-1435-3b62-ac28-74eca3f6f7a0,SO,2022-10-26,Why Southern Co. (SO) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-southern-co-could-beat-161004729.html,1666714204,STORY,['SO'],"[Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Southern Co. (SO), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this power company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 16.99%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Southern Co. Was expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 27.38%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.91 per share, while it actually produced $0.97 per share, a surprise of 6.59%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Southern Co.Estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Southern Co. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 27, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

217,b1a91574-70f1-3ff5-8401-9bd6bb8a9805,MAA,2022-10-26,Equity Residential (EQR) Q3 FFO and Revenues Top Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equity-residential-eqr-q3-ffo-220510601.html,1666735510,STORY,"['EQR', 'MAA-PI']","[Equity Residential (EQR) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.92 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.10%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.85 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.89, delivering a surprise of 4.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Equity Residential , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry, posted revenues of $695.1 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $623.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Equity Residential shares have lost about 29.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Equity Residential?While Equity Residential has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Equity Residential: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.95 on $704.78 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.52 on $2.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Residential is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 26.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.4%.

218,fa47e53e-1960-34c2-ade4-176e413d4de2,MAA,2022-10-26,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001952.html,1666703401,STORY,['MAA-PI'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.77%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Columbia Banking (COLB) is paying out a dividend of $0.3 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.86% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 7.14% over the past year. Check Columbia Banking (COLB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.25 per share, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) has a dividend yield of 3.37%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.63% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Findings show that vitality can be a key driver of personal, business and community growth, yet less than 20 percent of Americans are living with high vitality and Generation Z adults (aged 18-24) have the lowest levels of any age group. The full report is available here.Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9002352-cigna-champions-evernorth-vitality-index/Cigna Chairman and CEO David Cordani discusses health and vitality with Serena Williams in Nashville on Thursday, Oct. 20.Evernorth Vitality Index is a modern tool that can help us understand and influence vitality to help everyone thrive.Cigna developed the Evernorth Vitality Index to fill an emerging need as people and businesses recover from the pandemic and seek to improve health and well-being and drive workforce engagement, retention and productivity.""Harnessing the power of an individual's vitality is critical to our nation's future. The past few years clearly illustrated that health is multi-dimensional and we need a more comprehensive measurement approach – one that can assess how we are showing up at work, at home and in our communities,"" said David M. Cordani, Cigna Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""The Evernorth Vitality Index is a modern tool that can help us understand and influence vitality to help everyone thrive.""Results from the study were previewed at an event in Nashville, Tenn., that featured a fireside chat between Serena Williams and Cordani.""My personal journey as an athlete, mother and entrepreneur is impacted every day by how I'm feeling about my health, strength and energy, so paying attention to my vitality is incredibly important to me,"" Serena Williams said.Story continuesEvernorth Vitality Index key findingsThe Evernorth Vitality Index was developed in partnership with Dr. Richard Ryan, co-founder of the Subjective Vitality scale, and the benchmark survey was given to more than 10,000 American adults (aged 18-75) in May 2022. The results confirmed that those with higher vitality experience a wide range of benefits, from better mental and physical health to higher levels of job satisfaction and performance.Generation Z adults (aged 18-24) are struggling more than any other age group surveyed. One in four reported low vitality levels, which is in stark contrast to the ten percent of people aged 65-75 and the 16 percent of people aged 25-64 that fall into the low vitality category.Higher vitality is linked to a more motivated, productive workforce, while low vitality contributes to poor work quality, higher turnover and workplace dissatisfaction. By better understanding vitality and the factors that impact it, employers can help fuel a healthier workforce, and drive business and economic growth.""Good mental and physical health is central to people's vitality. Our research shows that when people have better health, they feel better about life. Likewise, when people feel higher levels of vitality, their health can improve,"" said Dr. David Brailer, Chief Health Officer, Cigna. ""Vitality is about all the dimensions of our lives that need attention. Going forward, Cigna will explore how health can drive vitality, whether that's through products like Cigna Pathwell that create personalized end-to-end health journeys for patients with chronic conditions, or by addressing the social determinants of health impacting our customers.""The benchmark survey shows that vitality scores vary by life stage, gender, sexual orientation, community density, income and more.

I think Adidas will retain some of the sales. They will not lose that $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of Yeezy sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not being branded under that brand as well.""In ending their relationship, Adidas will have a huge hole to fill financially: The popular Yeezy line represents about $1 billion to $2 billion in annual sales for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.A pair of Yeezy shoes from Adidas are seen in a Foot Locker store in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonAdidas severed ties with Ye on Tuesday morning after a spate of antisemitic comments by the musician-turned-designer in recent weeks.""Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech,"" the German company said in a statement. ""Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. Adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.""Adidas stock fell 3% on the news and is down about 65% so far in 2022.Adidas noted that it would miss out on $250 million in profits this year as a result of the decision.""This is coming at a tough time for the company,"" Sherman said. ""They had their second of two early earnings releases and guidedowns for the year. They are expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway... and this $250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4.""Aside from the West drama, Adidas is entering into the holiday season wounded as the latest retailer to get caught flat-footed operationally as global economies have slowed. That poor execution has primarily led to a glut of Adidas inventory that will have to be aggressively marked down at the expense of profits, the company warned a week ago.Story continues""The company’s new outlook takes into account a further deterioration of traffic trends in Greater China as well as a significant inventory build-up as a result of lower consumer demand in major Western markets since the beginning of September, which is expected to lead to higher promotional activity during the remainder of the year,"" Adidas stated on October 20.Adidas merchandise in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022.Evercore ISI's Omar Saad believes Adidas shares will be dead money as it works through excess inventory and also searches for a new CEO to replace long-time leader Kaspar Rorsted in 2023.""Adidas has been significantly underperforming in China before and through the pandemic (China sales 55% vs. pre-pandemic levels vs Nike 87%), and that divergence appears to be widening,"" Saad explained.

The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $813 million. Our estimate for the metric was $807.3 million.NII was $663 million, growing 19% in the prior-year quarter.

The program will support diverse women- and minority-led ideas, creating more resilient, equitable, and sustainable communities in U.S. cities.With a theme focused on ""Entrepreneurs vs. Climate Change,"" the Venture Fellows program will focus on supporting ideas that can be translated into startups. The program is housed within Larta Ventures - a new initiative of Larta Institute - that invests in promising founders and impact-focused startups who are working to feed, fuel, and heal the world.""Climate change impacts everyone everywhere, but the brunt of climate change's pervasive impacts are borne by the poor and by underserved communities,"" said Rohit Shukla, founder and CEO of Larta Institute. ""These impacts include extreme heat, lack of access to clean water, clean air and nutritious food, and the availability of sustainable living environments. Our Venture Fellows program aims to support innovative, practical solutions to these issues from budding entrepreneurs who are focused on making a difference in the lives of people facing the consequences of climate change.""Shukla continued: ""With this significant support from Wells Fargo, we look forward to launching and scaling our Venture Fellows program and to attract, support, and invest in undervalued innovators, with the goal of improving the wellbeing and resilience of local communities.""""There is a real need to create paths for diverse entrepreneurs to lead a more equitable and sustainable future,"" said Jenny Flores, head of small business growth philanthropy at Wells Fargo. ""The Venture Fellows program aims to improve access to capital and other resources needed by women, people of color, and other underrepresented founders to start, fund, and scale businesses that can have a positive impact on local communities. This program can become an example of what is possible when overlooked communities are empowered to solve humanity's pressing challenges.""Story continuesThrough the initial pilot program, a total of 10 sponsored Fellows will be selected to participate in two U.S. cities - Los Angeles and Miami. A call for applications from entrepreneurs of all backgrounds opened in October 2022, and the nine-month program in Los Angeles and Miami will begin in April 2023.The program will then be expanded to more U.S. cities, including but not limited to Atlanta, Chicago, Charlotte, Denver, Houston, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Oakland, and Seattle. These cities were selected strategically due to the prominence of the diverse make-up of the at-risk populations which the program seeks to impact.The nine-month fellowship program will fund and support diverse innovators via four key threads:$100,000 value in resources and funding per Fellow: This is a no-cost program for selected Fellows - no equity or fees - to develop community-based solutions, including one-on-one mentoring and group cohort sessions with industry connections, resources, and funding.Trial and iteration of ideas sourced from or applied to local communities: Fellows will deploy their minimal viable product (MVP) solution in a local community - Los Angeles or Miami for the pilot program - with market access support from local cities and NGOs and support to learn from real-life use case experiences.Payment of legal fees to incorporate startup ventures and local initiatives: Legal services will be provided to Fellows for incorporation, including expert advice on creating their startup and setup of their business with legal support.Access to investors and grant funding to scale startups: Hands-on help will be provided to prepare pitch and materials, with support for identifying and applying for funding and grants. There will also be curated sessions with seed investors, culminating in a Demo Day to help scale their startup.""The Venture Fellows program supports innovators through a mix of mentoring, connections, resources, and funding,"" said Lewis D. Rowe, entrepreneur-in-residence at Larta Ventures. ""Our social impact commitment will focus on entrepreneurs and founders who have been overlooked by traditional private investment capital sources. With the Venture Fellows program, we want to accelerate ideas that have the potential to make a tangible impact on underserved communities across the U.S., while supporting communities' urgent need to adapt to climate change.""The Venture Fellows program as a whole is designed to align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) #13 - ""Take action to combat the impacts of climate change and its impacts."" Also known as the Global Goals, the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The Venture Fellows program will also accelerate solutions aligned to additional UN SDGs, including:Goals 6 &amp; 7 - Clean Energy, Air, and Water:Our communities, especially in cities, are critically affected by polluted air, increasing heat episodes and clean water availability. These concerns are interrelated and are expected to increase in intensity and impact in coming years. Our communities have a right to clean air, sources of reliable, affordable energy from renewable sources like solar and wind, and water for drinking and everyday use. All these issues are exacerbated by accelerating climate change. We seek community-led approaches that may work alongside municipalities, like small-scale solar and wind projects, water cleaning projects and the use of non-traditional approaches to cleaning our air.Goal 2 - Food Security and Zero Hunger:Food insecurity, and lack of access to nutritious food is increasingly acknowledged by policymakers, community organizations, social impact entrepreneurs, impact entities, and others, especially as these issues pertain to dense urban environments. Today, new disruptions challenge food security and the global food supply chains, even in zones previously unaffected, while inflation has driven essential foods into the realm of unaffordability for many communities across the U.S. Cities need new plans to maintain resilience and engage with communities to ""reimagine"" food sourcing. We seek changemakers with creative visions in urban farming, city food access, crop diversification, sustainable agriculture, nutrition enhancement, curbing food waste, and solutions for populations at most risk for hunger.Goal 11 - Safe, Inclusive, and Sustainable Cities:City transformation is one of the most critical needs for a sustainable future. High population density and outdated infrastructure make city residents highly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. Rapid urbanization means our cities face deepening challenges in air pollution, concrete ""heat islands,"" infrastructure, services, urban sprawl, traffic, waste management, gas emissions, inequality, rising sea levels and carbon emissions. We seek practical solutions that can make modern cities more resilient and adaptable in areas such as public space transformation, smart housing, resource efficiency, education, and transportation.With 40% of Larta Institute's current portfolio company CEOs or leadership teams identifying as women and/or minority-led, this funding from Wells Fargo is designed to enhance support for diverse founders of high-growth, early-stage startups to generate greater societal and environmental impact, stronger communities, and prosperity for all.To learn more or apply to become a Venture Fellow in Los Angeles or Miami, please visit:Larta.org/Venture-FellowsAbout Larta VenturesLarta Ventures, a subsidiary of the non-profit organization Larta Institute, invests in promising founders and startups who are working to feed, fuel, and heal the world.

Funded with a $7.5 million grant from the Wells Fargo Foundation, the initiative kicked off with a housing and homeownership fair at the Community College of Philadelphia.The donation comes from the Wells Fargo Wealth Opportunity Restored Through Homeownership (WORTH) initiative, a $60 million national effort to address systemic barriers to homeownership for people of color. Philadelphia is one of eight markets across the U.S. to receive a WORTH grant. The ULP aims to create 5,000 new homeowners of color in Philadelphia by the end of 2025.""We are committed to this work now more than ever,"" said Keith Bethel, Board Chair of the Urban League of Philadelphia. ""Philly 5 by 25 will ensure that more Philadelphians have an opportunity to raise their families in quality affordable housing and create a pathway to intergenerational wealth. We're incredibly grateful for Wells Fargo's investment in this critical work, and we look forward to driving equitable change alongside our partners and local stakeholders.""""Combined with federal investments in housing that we've recently passed, this type of private‑sector initiative is important and welcome in Philadelphia,"" said Congressman Dwight Evans.""Removing barriers that limit people from realizing their goals is essential for a more equitable society,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation and head of Philanthropy and Community Impact. ""We need deliberate action to address the racial homeownership gap. Our grant to ‘Philly 5 by 25' is intended to mobilize collaboration across the city to make affordable homeownership a reality for thousands of Philadelphians.""According to a 2021 report from the Urban Institute, Philadelphia continues to face a significant homeownership gap, with 59% of white households owning their own homes, while only 43% of Black households and 48% of Hispanic households do. In addition, the characteristics of Philadelphia's households and housing market make growing the number of Black and Hispanic homeowners immensely challenging, including old housing stock and tangled titles.Story continuesConvened by ULP, ""Philly 5 by 25"" brings together five community‑based organizations with deep networks in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, including HACE, Congreso De Latinos Unidos, New Kensington Community Development Corp, and the Urban Affairs Coalition.Recognizing the breadth of housing inequities in Philadelphia, the collaborative plans to implement five strategies that build on recent successes and plan new investments to address the remaining barriers to support homebuyers:Address the lack of savings that locks many households of color out of homeownership through down payment assistanceConnect inexperienced or credit‑challenged buyers with resources and financingExpand the supply of existing affordable housing inventory through an affordable housing development fundImplement and advocate for structural changes to create and preserve wealth‑building opportunities for people of colorReach prospective homebuyers of color through citywide informational and marketing campaignThe launch of ""Philly 5 by 25"" builds on significant efforts and proven track records by the local organizations to address deep‑rooted housing challenges, including the work by lead collaborative convener, the Urban League of Philadelphia. Just last year, ULP's housing counseling department successfully provided financial literacy services for 2,400 families, with 850 receiving one‑on‑one first‑time homebuyer counseling, and 230 achieving homeownership for a total market value of over $52 million. 85% of the clients served by ULP are people of color, and 70% are single women head of household, a trend that carries through the organizations that make up ""Philly 5 by 25.""""What we're doing with this new collaborative is special, and it's necessary,"" said Terri Wiggins, interim CEO of the ULP. ""We're emboldened to break down siloes and work with our local partners to reach the same collective goal.""Wells Fargo is working to increase racial equity in homeownership. Nationally, WORTH aims to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color by the end of 2025. Wells Fargo's $40 million Growing Diverse Housing Developers program is also working to expand housing inventory in communities of color, among other initiatives.

232,8174d8bb-bb3a-3651-8d37-7d01ce7db87d,PFE,2022-10-26,Pfizer (PFE) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-pfe-reports-next-week-140102384.html,1666706462,STORY,"['PFE', 'ABBV']","[Pfizer (PFE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.7%.Revenues are expected to be $21.04 billion, down 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pfizer?For Pfizer, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pfizer will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pfizer would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.04, delivering a surprise of +16.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pfizer doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAbbVie (ABBV), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.56 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +6.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $14.92 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for AbbVie has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.04%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AbbVie will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

233,e7b2410b-256e-386f-843e-f899fe5fe138,PFE,2022-10-26,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001133.html,1666703401,STORY,['PFE'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Cambridge (CATC) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.64 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.02%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.39% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 4.92%. Check Cambridge (CATC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) is paying out a dividend of $0.16 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.18% compared to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 2.55% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 3.33% over the past year. Check Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.4 per share, Pfizer (PFE) has a dividend yield of 3.51%. This is compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.71% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.56%. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

234,a2c7522d-b578-352d-8c6e-92f7299f0e57,FOXA,2022-10-26,Fox (FOXA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-reports-next-week-140102867.html,1666706462,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox (FOXA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis TV broadcasting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.19 billion, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fox?For Fox, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fox will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fox would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of -5.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fox doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:PYPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings Is PayPal Holdings Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.94bUS$8.03bUS$8.99bUS$8.38bUS$8.05bUS$7.88bUS$7.81bUS$7.80bUS$7.85bUS$7.92bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -3.92%Est @ -2.15%Est @ -0.91%Est @ -0.04%Est @ 0.56%Est @ 0.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$6.5kUS$7.0kUS$7.4kUS$6.4kUS$5.8kUS$5.3kUS$4.9kUS$4.6kUS$4.3kUS$4.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$56bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$164bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$164b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$84bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$141b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$89.2, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PayPal Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.050. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Tech Reporter Dan Howley is here with the details. Dan, what do we need to know?DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Seana. There's going to be a new payment option available for Amazon users. They're rolling Venmo into the payment option offerings there. Once you start to finish up your potential shopping spree, you'll just be able to add your Venmo account there. You'll have to authorize it. And then once it's there, you can use that as one of your default purchase settings.Now, it's going to be rolling out slowly. It will be available by Black Friday for all users in the US. But you may start to see it as an option to add to that checkout portion of Amazon. And you know, this obviously, a big deal for PayPal. Venmo is owned by PayPal. So shares of PayPal are up more than 7% on the day as a result.And so this is, I think, just another way for Amazon to ensure that however users want to pay, they'll be able to pay. They've added other options in the past. So this is just another extension of that effort going forward.DAVE BRIGGS: Are there other platforms that accept the Venmo payment? As they're more coming down this road?DAN HOWLEY: Oh, yeah, there's plenty of other businesses that accept Venmo as a payment option. I think this is probably, obviously, one of the largest as far as commerce and e-commerce goes. But, you know, there's plenty of others out there.A lot of small shops actually use it as their primary means of payment. I mean, if you, you know, live in an apartment, chances are your landlord allows you to use Venmo as a payment option. Although, mine doesn't and they need to get on that.But yeah, it is something that you're going to see go across more e-commerce platforms as we continue to see Venmo just really take over as a payment option for people in Gen X, Gen Z, and millennials.DAVE BRIGGS: Excited for that. CVS, Uber, they allow a credit card so I think a lot of us have been waiting for this. Dan Howley, good stuff. Thank you.]"

246,af357c7a-d36f-3938-b406-d96d8123ff9f,IBM,2022-10-26,2 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks With High Yields; Analysts Say ‘Buy’,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-blue-chip-dividend-stocks-133041967.html,1666704641,STORY,"['IBM', 'T-PC']","[Markets are volatile, with an overall bear trend combining with short rallies to confuse investors. Economic headwinds are piling up, in the form of stubbornly high inflation, rising interest rates and tighter money from the Federal Reserve, growing evidence of a slowing economy, and an increased potential for a deep recession in the next few months.For investors focused on defense, blue chip dividend stocks are natural plays. The blue chips are stocks with reputations for high quality, capable of retaining their value even in a difficult economic climate. Add in quality dividends, with long histories of reliability current yields of 5% or better, and the combination is unbeatable for portfolio protection: value, income stream, and insulation against inflation.Wall Street’s analysts have picked up on the theme, and high-yield blue chip dividend payers feature prominently among their recent recommendations. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database and pulled the details on two of these stocks, blue chips with easily recognizable names and long histories as solid defensive options. Let's take a closer look.IBM (IBM)We’ll start with a true stock market stalwart, a long-time fixture of the Dow Jones index, and a name that everyone will recognize: IBM. The company is known as a producer of computer hardware and software, and a provider of cloud and consulting services. IBM boasts a market cap of ~$119 billion, so its pockets are deep enough to weather an economic storm.IBM has also been bringing in the revenue results, giving the company additional resources to survive in today’s tough conditions. The company reported $14.1 billion at the top line for 3Q22, reported earlier this month, a total that was up 6% from the year-ago quarter. IBM’s top line was supported by gains in all four of its major segments: a 5% gain in consulting, a 7% gain in software, and larger gains in hybrid cloud and infrastructure, of 15% and 23% respectively. In addition, IBM showed a net cash of $6.5 billion, with a free cash flow of $4.1 billion.Story continuesIBM’s solid cash position helped support the dividend, which has a reliable payment history going back to 1913. Not many company’s can boast of a dividend history lasting more than a century. As for the current payment, IBM declared its Q3 common share dividend in August, for $1.65 per share. The dividend was paid out in September. At its current rate, the payment annualizes to $6.60 per common share and yields 5%. This is more than double the average dividend payout in the broader market.Writing from Jefferies, analyst Kyle McNealy is impressed by IBM’s staying power – and its ability to withstand a market storm. McNealy says of the company: “In the face of multiple headwinds (i.e., FX, Russia, labor cost inflation), IBM has been able to offset some of the impact with outperformance in Consulting and Infrastructure. Further, they’re not seeing much slowdown from customers in response to the uncertain macro.”""Given the attractive valuation at 8.4x EV/2023E EBITDA, we think the stock can perform well if the company executes consistently to plan even without outsized beat-and-raise quarters. We continue to see opportunity for the shares to re-rate higher as investors gain more confidence in management execution, the growth profile improves, and Software/Services become an increasing mix of the business,"" McNealy added.Going forward from these comments, McNealy gives IBM shares a Buy rating, and his $160 price target suggests an upside of 21% for the next 12 months. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~26% potential total return profile (To watch McNealy’s track record, click here)Overall, IBM has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 8 reviews breaking down to 5 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. Shares in IBM are selling for $132.69 and their $140.63 average price target implies a one-year gain of ~6%. (See IBM stock forecast on TipRanks)AT&amp;T (T)Next up is one of the stock market’s all-time dividend champions, AT&amp;T. This blue chip company is another of the market’s oldest, most recognizable names; it got started in telecommunications when telecommunications meant sending messages along the telegraph wires. Telegraphs gave way to telephones, and later to digital and wireless communications, and AT&amp;T has adapted to the changing world over the decades. Today, the company is heavily invested in 5G, as well as traditional fiber-optic broadband networks, and remains a leading provider of landline telephone services.It's an impressive history for the $125 billion company. In its current incarnation, AT&amp;T brings in annual revenues on the order of $168 billion or more, although quarterly top lines in both Q2 and Q3 this year were down from 2021. In Q2, the company brought in $29.6 billion; that rose slightly to $30 billion in Q3 – but that most recent quarterly total was down 24% year-over-year.At the same time, T shares surged after the Q3 earnings release, despite the drop in overall revenues. The reason was a strong performance in wireless and fiber broadband customer gains, which exceeded expectations. Furthermore, the company’s EPS, at 68 cents, was up 3% y/y. And the $3.8 billion in free cash flow, while below the forecast, was more than enough for AT&amp;T to keep up its common share dividend.The current payment is 27.75 cents per share, which annualizes to $1.11, gives a yield of 6.3%. This is more than triple the average dividend found among S&amp;P-listed firms. AT&amp;T has a reputation for never missing payments, and its modern dividend history goes back to 1984.Analyst Frank Louthan, from Raymond James, notes AT&amp;T’s gains in subscriptions and earnings, and writes, “In a world where there are just two critical factors for AT&amp;T’s stock performance (wireless subs and EPS growth) this was all it took... AT&amp;T’s simpler story is starting to show up in the numbers. We continue to believe a more focused vision along a simpler line of business creates a solid scenario for share price appreciation, and a solid, total return.""Louthan backs this view with a Strong Buy rating on the shares, and his $24 price target indicates potential for a 37% upside in the coming year. (To watch Louthan’s track record, click here)Overall, this blue chip gets a Moderate Buy from the Street’s consensus, based on 13 analyst reviews, including 5 Buys and 8 Holds. AT&amp;T has a trading price of $17.51 and an average target of $20.09, suggesting ~15% upside by the end of next year.

She hopes it will inspire others who are deciding how they can best achieve their education and career training goals.I grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with my twin sister, a paralegal, and my older brother, a computer science high school teacher. My mom worked in human resources and my dad worked as a manager for a paint manufacturing company for over 30 years. Growing up, my parents always encouraged us to do whatever made us happy. At first, I thought about going to nursing school but that quickly changed because I'm emotional and get attached quickly. I felt like I needed to major in something related to technology because, at home, I've always been the go-to IT person. Everyone would come to me with tech questions, and I've always been interested in how data works, so I ultimately decided that computer science would be a good route for me.After high school, I enrolled in Baton Rouge Community College where I studied computer science. Starting at a community college felt like the best route for me, not only to save money, but I knew college credits would transfer should I decide down the line to pursue a four-year degree. While in college, I was introduced to IBM SkillsBuild via my computer science instructor. I looked through the program online and found it very interesting and helpful, so I took a few courses and received badges in cybersecurity, professional workplace skills, and agile learning. During the pandemic, I found myself with free time, so I was happy to find a new avenue to spend my time while gaining new skills. IBM SkillsBuild was extremely valuable in giving me a foundation in the many fields of computer science and gaining fundamental knowledge. The ability to take courses at my own pace, without due dates, was tremendously valuable.Story continuesWhen I heard about the IBM Apprenticeship program, I immediately knew I wanted to be a part of it. This is a paid, one-year program with a competitive admissions process, in which participants take IBM classes and receive on-the-job training. I'd been working part-time at the Louisiana Department of Education for a few years as a student worker and felt like I was ready to train for and potentially take on a job within the field I majored in. Initially, there wasn't an opening for IBM's Apprenticeship program in Baton Rouge, so I would check the website periodically until a local opportunity became available. I applied and the next thing I knew I received an offer. I was shocked - and so happy and proud of what I had achieved.I'm pleased with the decisions I've made for my career so far. If I hadn't joined Baton Rouge Community College, I probably wouldn't be here today. Community college classes are smaller, so I was fortunate to have one-on-one time with my professors and other students. When it came to my career journey, they looked out for me and introduced me to the many resources IBM has to offer.My advice to students trying to get into the field of technology or those unsure about their career path is to take the time to learn and practice and find something that makes them happy. It's easy to get frustrated if other students pick up skills or find a job faster than you. Their pace isn't your pace. Coding and programming might be the first thing people think of when they think about a tech career but that's not it. There are hundreds of free online tech courses, like IBM SkillsBuild, to get your career started and see if this field of study is for you. Go in with a growth mindset and be curious because technology is an ever-growing field.I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me. In the next five years, I hope to see myself still working in the tech field and at IBM. Having worked on projects that made a difference for people. Being a mentor to others like me to help them see their potential.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722170/How-IBM-SkillsBuild-Supercharged-a-Community-College-Students-Career-Path]"
248,e024c1a5-1d90-3f6a-84f9-919689a2e651,IBM,2022-10-26,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-130001673.html,1666702801,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.19 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.9%. This estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.78 indicates a change of +6.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.85 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.69 billion and $60.19 billion estimates indicate -15.7% and +0.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

249,ed24480c-2621-3fcb-be11-6adf12c3c2a3,MPC,2022-10-26,Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-mpc-reports-next-140202608.html,1666706522,STORY,['MPC'],"[The market expects Marathon Petroleum (MPC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +831.5%.Revenues are expected to be $35.67 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.66% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Petroleum?For Marathon Petroleum, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Petroleum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Petroleum would post earnings of $9.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $10.61, delivering a surprise of +15.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marathon Petroleum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

This compares to earnings of $1.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil refiner would post earnings of $9.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.36, delivering a surprise of 17.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Valero Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $44.45 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $29.52 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Valero Energy shares have added about 72% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Valero Energy?While Valero Energy has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Valero Energy: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing is currently in the top 4% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Marathon Petroleum (MPC), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY). ICAGY is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 10.17. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.72.

This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. ICAGY's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 17.77. Over the past 52 weeks, ICAGY's P/CF has been as high as 5.59 and as low as -4.87, with a median of -3.03.Investors could also keep in mind United Airlines (UAL), an Transportation - Airline stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.United Airlines sports a P/B ratio of 2.70 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 4.07.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 35% losses, last week’s 5.5% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Target. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Target does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Target, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Target. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Target Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$170m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Target  you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

This compares to FFO of $1.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 2.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $1.85 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.94, delivering a surprise of 4.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Boston Properties , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $739.26 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $692.26 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Boston Properties shares have lost about 36.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Boston Properties?While Boston Properties has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Boston Properties: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $1.89 on $728.25 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.52 on $2.89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 46% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company’s operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.PORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES% Leased by LocationSeptember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Boston91.4 %91.4 %Los Angeles90.0 %88.8 %New York86.9 %87.6 %San Francisco87.3 %87.3 %Seattle89.1 %90.9 %Washington, DC88.1 %87.2 %Total Portfolio88.9 %88.8 %View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221025006124/en/ContactsAT BXP Michael LaBelleExecutive Vice President,Chief Financial Officer and Treasurermlabelle@bxp.comHelen HanVice President, Investor Relationshhan@bxp.com]"

This compares to earnings of $0.89 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -2.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this student loan servicing company would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of 16.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Navient , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, posted revenues of $247 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.53%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $299 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Navient shares have lost about 27% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Navient?While Navient has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Navient: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.78 on $273.48 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.39 on $1.2 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

289,e43942ed-7e52-3a15-bded-6752f827183e,ADI,2022-10-26,"Positive week for Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) institutional investors who lost 17% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-analog-devices-inc-110051647.html,1666782051,STORY,['ADI'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 17% losses, last week’s 3.7% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Analog Devices, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Analog Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Analog Devices' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Analog Devices. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.9% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Analog Devices, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$255m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Analog Devices. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Analog Devices  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NYSE:V)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-110014183.html,1666782014,STORY,['V'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Visa's (NYSE:V) recent performance, when its stock has declined 7.6% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Visa's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Visa How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Visa is:41% = US$15b ÷ US$35b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.41 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Visa's Earnings Growth And 41% ROETo begin with, Visa has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Visa was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Visa's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 14% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for V? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Visa Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Visa has a low three-year median payout ratio of 23%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 77% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Moreover, Visa is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. However, Visa's ROE is predicted to rise to 51% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Visa's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Adam Norwitt. ""Sales increased from prior year by a strong 17%, supported by robust growth across virtually all our end markets, as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program which were partially offset by the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Despite the many challenges in the world economy, we again realized strong profitability, with Adjusted Operating Margin reaching 21.0% and Adjusted Diluted EPS growing by an impressive 23% from prior year. We are very proud of the Company’s outstanding performance in this challenging and dynamic quarter.""""During the third quarter, Amphenol continued to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value. To that end, the Company purchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock for $170 million and paid dividends of $119 million, resulting in total capital returned to shareholders of $289 million.""""We remain focused on expanding our growth opportunities through a deep commitment to developing enabling technologies for customers across our served markets, an ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification and an active and successful acquisition program. To that end, we are excited to have closed on the acquisition of Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, Inc. (ICA) in September. With locations across North America and with annual sales of approximately $90 million, ICA manufactures a broad array of cable assemblies for a diversified range of applications, particularly in the industrial market.

The new dividend amount will be paid on January 11, 2023 to shareholders of record as of December 20, 2022.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 OutlookThe current economic environment remains uncertain and is increasingly dynamic. Assuming conditions do not meaningfully worsen and assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter of 2022, Amphenol expects sales to be in the range of $3.090 billion to $3.150 billion. This represents 2% to 4% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021 and includes a 5 percentage point negative currency impact. Adjusted Diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.75, representing 4% to 7% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022, we expect sales to be in the range of $12.474 billion to $12.534 billion. This represents 15% growth over 2021 and includes a 3 percentage point negative currency impact. Adjusted Diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.95 to $2.97, representing 19% to 20% growth over 2021.""Despite the ongoing challenges and uncertainties around the world, we are very pleased with the Company’s strong third quarter results,"" Mr. Norwitt continued.

303,4b1b8f3a-2bb3-3e22-9744-06938cb4479f,MAR,2022-10-26,Why Marriott (MAR) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-marriott-mar-poised-beat-161004042.html,1666714204,STORY,['MAR'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Marriott International (MAR), which belongs to the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry.When looking at the last two reports, this hotel company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 22.39%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Marriott came out with earnings of $1.80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 per share, representing a surprise of 13.21%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.25 per share, delivering a surprise of 31.58%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Marriott. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marriott has an Earnings ESP of +1.55% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 3, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Marriott International (MAR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MAR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marriott International's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marriott International's main business drivers.Marriott International Inc. is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising, after the spin-off of its timeshare business into a publicly-traded company in Nov 2011.During second quarter 2022, the company added 97 new properties (16,917 rooms) to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, 25 properties (or 3,661 rooms) exited the system during the quarter. At the end of second-quarter, Marriott's development pipeline totaled nearly 2,942 hotels, with approximately 495,000 rooms. Nearly 203,300 rooms were under construction.As of Aug 2, 2022, the company operated, franchised and acted as a licensor of hotels as well as timeshare properties to more than 8,100 properties across 139 countries and territories under 30 brand names.The company has grouped its brand portfolio into three groups:Luxury: The company’s classic luxury hotel brands include JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, and St. Regis. Meanwhile, Marriott’s distinctive luxury hotel brands comprise W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, EDITION, and Bulgari.Premium: The company’s classic premium hotel brands include Marriott Hotels, Sheraton, Delta Hotels, Marriott Executive Apartments, and Marriott Vacation Club. Moreover, its distinctive premium hotel brands comprise Westin, Renaissance, Le Méridien, Autograph Collection, Gaylord Hotels, Tribute Portfolio and Design Hotels.Select: The company’s classic select hotel brand include Courtyard, Residence Inn, Fairfield by Marriott, SpringHill Suites, Four Points, TownePlace Suites, and Protea Hotels. Meanwhile, Marriott’s distinctive select hotel brands comprise Aloft, AC Hotels by Marriott, Element, and Moxy.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Marriott International a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $4,253.02, or a 325.30% gain, as of October 25, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 169.55% and the price of gold went up -7.45% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for MAR too.Shares of Marriott have outperformed the industry in the past year. The company is benefiting from its focus on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program. The company is gaining from the reopening of international borders and leniency in travel restrictions. Marriott is consistently trying to expand its worldwide presence and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. However, a resurgence in coronavirus cases in several parts of the world might hurt the company’s performance. Although RevPAR is improving sequentially, it is still below the pre-pandemic level. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days, depicting analysts concern regarding the stock growth potential.The stock has jumped 13.77% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

China sales generally account for around a fifth of its overall sales.""We know COVID is making things unpredictable, but nevertheless, our customer studies and our economic research is incredibly optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the China market,"" Bozec said.He declined to comment on investment figures for China - a main growth market as Tapestry seeks to ratchet up global revenue to $8 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $6.7 billion in the year just ended.CEMENTING A LEADAmong Tapestry's closest competitors, Ralph Lauren says it is sticking with plans, outlined in 2018, to have 150 stores in Greater China by the end of next April, up from 135 today, with a focus on tier-one cities.Compared to the past two years, however, most luxury brands have gone silent about new store openings for China.""Generally, the lockdowns and falling consumer sentiment have encouraged retailers to pause and reassess expansion plans,"" said James Macdonald, head of Savills Research China.Michael Kors and Tory Burch - both competitors in the ""accessible luxury"" segment, did not reply to Reuters requests for comment on their plans in China.Tapestry also intends to expand its product lines in China, such as adding handbags to its offerings for its third brand Stuart Weitzman.Another change, in a nod to Chinese consumer tastes, will be the introduction of ""livestreaming studios"" at some Coach stores to allow customers to broadcast their shopping experience to social media followers, Bozec said.Analysts see Tapestry's pursuit of more stores as an opportunity to cement its lead in brand penetration in China.The company has 360 stores across 80 cities in China. In contrast, Michael Kors-owner Capri Holdings had 288 stores as of 2020. Tory Burch lists 68 mainland China stores on its website.Coach's luxury market share in China is also more than double that of Michael Kors and more than triple that of Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch, according to Euromonitor data.Oliver Chen, a Cowen analyst, said Tapestry can benefit from price hikes of up to 60% among top-tier luxury brands in recent years that make Coach look more attractive in terms of value.Coach's ""footprint is still not saturated relative to the opportunity,"" he added.(Reporting by Casey Hall; Editing by Brenda Goh and Edwina Gibbs)]"

317,f4853e66-a7f5-3e1b-9bbf-c563efc21172,TPR,2022-10-26,4 Stocks to Bet on in an Inflation-Hit Retail-Apparel & Shoes Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-bet-inflation-hit-140202085.html,1666706522,STORY,"['CHS', 'DBI', 'TPR']","[Product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been encountering lately. These, along with geopolitical turbulence due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have been making things tough for companies. Evidently, demand for apparel has softened as consumers are spending more on necessities owing to soaring prices.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc. TPR, Designer Brands Inc. DBI, Hibbett, Inc. HIBB and Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS are set to cash in on the opportunities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks; leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers, and belts; and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories. Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites, and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed-to-market. In a bid to address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesSoft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. But higher gasoline and food prices have been discomforting the family budgets. The consumer price index rose to 8.2% in September 2022 on a year-over-year basis. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation are making things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, demand for apparel has softened, resulting in an inventory pile-up.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. In fact, they have been making every move, from managing inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior amid the pandemic, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #144, which places it in the bottom 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Chico's FAS (CHS). CHS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 5.95, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.25. Over the past year, CHS's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.56 and as low as 4.98, with a median of 9.82.Investors should also recognize that CHS has a P/B ratio of 2.31.

This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.48. Over the past year, CHS's P/B has been as high as 4.22 and as low as 1.92, with a median of 2.63.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. CHS has a P/S ratio of 0.34. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.38.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that CHS has a P/CF ratio of 4.45.

That number rises to 69% among businesses with $10MM plus annual revenue and 64% among those with 20 years or more of experience. Looking to the future, 48% believe training the next generation of trades professionals is one of the most critical needs for the success of the construction industry in 2023.""The DEWALT Powering the Future Survey sheds further light on the wide-reaching gap in skilled labor and its continued impact on the residential and commercial construction industries. Add to that the overwhelming demand for trades expertise during the COVID-19 pandemic and the [skilled-labor] gap is quickly becoming the most critical need that will dictate the future success of the field,"" said Allison Nicolaidis, President, Power Tools Group, Stanley Black &amp; Decker. ""That's why DEWALT is committed to putting a heavier spotlight on these challenges and taking a lead role in supporting our industrial and construction partners to overcome them.

When it comes to the effects those challenges are having on the industry, an overwhelming majority of contractors-93%-feel the lack of skilled workers has had at least a minor impact on their existing work.Half of those contractors who have had their work impacted by the labor shortage (50%) cite the primary causes for the gap as a lack of awareness around career paths in construction, followed by outside influences (parents, media, etc.) that guide younger people away from pursuing a career in the industry (47%), as well as an underestimation of how much money can be made in the industry (41%).Mentorship MattersA great deal of importance is placed on mentorship programs regardless of contractor level, tenure, or type, with 67% of all contractors labeling these programs as extremely important with an additional 24% identifying these programs as moderately important. A larger majority of contractors with extensive experience (20+ years) or high business revenue ($10MM or more) find these programs to be extremely important (71% and 78% respectively) in providing the latest training to help young professionals prepare for onsite work. In addition, more than half (53%) of contractors surveyed say mentorship increases excitement about construction as a career path.Health and Wellbeing are EssentialSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, contractors have experienced numerous changes in the industry. According to the survey, the number one takeaway (39%) from the pandemic among contractors is the importance of employee mental health and wellbeing.Most contractors (56%) have been working more hours since 2019, with mechanical (68%), plumbing (66%) and electrical (60%) contractors more likely to have seen an increase in labor hours since the pandemic began. Nearly 40% of all contractors surveyed say longer hours have made their jobs more difficult.2023 ForecastHalf of contractors (48%) identify training the next generation of workers as one of the most critical industry focus areas in 2023 and beyond. Seasoned contractors are particularly committed to training the next generation of workers, with 63% of those in the industry for 20 or more years indicating this is a paramount goal for the future. The second and third most critical elements for growth are contingency planning/risk management and resilient supply chain solutions (both 37%).Also indicated as an important element of future success is the innovation of tools and equipment (33%).

If you want to see more of the best value dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Value Dividend Stocks To Buy.Inflation remains a headwind for the markets in 2022. In terms of inflation, the annual U.S. inflation rate was 8.2% in September, down only slightly from August's 8.3%.Too much inflation isn't good for an economy as it makes many future investments harder to do. Inflation is also bad for many consumers as it takes away some of their buying power if their incomes don't rise enough to compensate for the price increases.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised rates five times to increase the federal funds effective rate from near zero in the beginning of 2022 to 2.56% in September 2022. As the federal funds effective rate has gone higher, some interest rate sensitive parts of the economy such as housing have cooled. Nevertheless, inflation remains high and many expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased substantially and many traditional dividend stocks have become less attractive. Due to the interest rate hikes, the 10 year Treasury yield has gone from 1.512% at the end of 2021 to 4.209% as of 10/24, meaning many traditional attractive dividend stocks with yields of 2% or 3% actually have lower yields than the 10 year Treasury yield.As a result, many dividend stocks are lower this year, along with the market. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio with stocks across many different sectors.While there could still be more downside left given the potential for a recession in 2023, there is still potential for the high quality dividend stocks to bounce back in the long term if the Federal Reserve eventually controls the inflation.Here are 12 high quality dividend stocks to consider.Story continues15 fastest growing dividend stocksCopyright: netsay / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Value Dividend Stocks To Buy, we took quality stocks that had dividend yields of over 2% and whose average analyst price targets were 20% or higher above their stock prices as of 10/24.Using the collective wisdom of hedge funds, we then ranked the 12 based on the number of hedge fund holders in our database who held shares in the stocks at the end of Q2 2022.12 Best Value Dividend Stocks To Buy12. Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 4.73%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) is a leading Canadian bank with a dividend yield of 4.73% as of 10/24 whose shares are down 16% year to date. As a leading bank, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) faces headwinds given that Canada's economy could face headwinds in the next year.The chief economist of the IMF Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said of the Canadian economy, ""The Canadian economy has been doing well in the rebound, but it's buffeted by the same winds that are affecting the global economy. There is a slowdown in the US that is coming. Commodity prices, energy prices are coming down. There are all the uncertainties, financial tightening and financial markets are very nervous. All of these factors are going to weigh down on on the Canadian economy next year.""In the long term, however, Canada's economy has a lot of growth potential given the country's massive resources, its proximity to the United States, and its relatively small population. As a result, Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) is considered a value stock. Analysts have an average price target of $120.19 per share.Alongside American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI), Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO) is a quality dividend stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of the second quarter.11. The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 6.42%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is another leading Canadian bank whose results depend on how the Canadian economy does. Given that The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) has considerable international presence given its past acquisitions, the bank's stock also depends on Latin America and other regions. Given that there have arguably been more headwinds in Latin America than that have been in Canada, shares of The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) have fallen more than its peer Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO).As of 10/24, The Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) has fallen slightly over 34% year to date and shares have a dividend yield of 6.42%. Analysts have an average target price of $62.22 per share.10. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 2.28%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Software giant SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has fallen almost 35% year to date due to the broader market sell-off in tech stocks. As a result, SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is arguably a dividend stock given its dividend yield of 2.28% as of 10/24.

(NYSE:SWK)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 4.21%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is down almost 60% year to date as higher interest rates have cooled the housing market. A weaker market and potentially softer industrial markets have also been headwinds for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) shares.As a result of the decline, Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is a dividend stock with a dividend yield of 4.21%. Analysts have an average price target of $102.15 per share.7. Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 2.33%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) shares have fallen 37% year to date as higher Treasury yields have made the company's 2.33% dividend yield as of 10/24 less attractive to some investors. Nevertheless, analysts have an average price target of $732.41 per share and Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) still has a lot of growth potential left.Baron Real Estate Income Fund commented on Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Equinix, Inc. is a network dense global data operator of over 240 data centers in 69 metros and 30 countries. Its customers place high value on the ecosystem of customers that Equinix has curated within its data centers over many years so that they are able to interconnect within the data center facility instead of having data travel through the public internet (latency sensitive applications as well as data security considerations). Customers value the global network with 90% of customers in multiple metropolitan areas and 75% in multiple geographic regions. Equinix has a diverse but valuable customer base with no single customer greater than 2.6% of recurring monthly revenues. COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation priorities for many organizations, and we believe that Equinix will be poised to benefit from: i) organic growth through new bookings and pricing power (the majority of incremental bookings are from existing customers); ii) growth of high margin cross-connect revenue (approximately 20% of total); and iii) continued geographic expansion through development and select M&amp;A. We believe the combination of these factors will allow the company to grow annual cash flow in the high single digit range.”6. AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN)Dividend Yield as of 10/24: 3.44%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Although its shares are down 5.3% year to date due to the weaker market, AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN) stock has performed well in the long run with shares more than doubling from the beginning of 2012. With a dividend yield of 3.44% as of 10/24 and an average analyst price target of $71.9, AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN) is arguably a value dividend stock.Like AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Microsoft reported Intelligent Cloud growth of 20% in Q1, far lower than the 31% growth the segment saw in Q1 2022. Azure growth, in particular, fell to 35% in Q1 versus 50% in the same quarter last year.Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)Microsoft is also dealing with a dramatic fall off in the PC market, which has seen sales collapse following the huge growth it experienced during the pandemic.According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments declined 19.5% from 84.1 million units in Q3 2021 to 68 million in Q3 2022, falling back to pre-pandemic levels.“This quarter’s results could mark a historic slowdown for the PC market,” Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa wrote in a release. “While supply chain disruptions have finally eased, high inventory has now become a major issue given weak PC demand in both the consumer and business markets.”Story continuesMicrosoft isn’t the only company feeling the impact of the decline in PC sales. Shares of Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA), which produce chips used in PCs, plummeted this year. Intel has collapsed 46% year-to-date, while AMD and Nvidia are off 57% and 54%, respectively.The holiday season is generally a bright spot for PC makers as consumers buy laptops and desktops for family members and themselves.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 65% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.0% increase in share prices after a year of 46% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NVIDIA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 5.4% of the company stock. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.4% of the company's shares.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$13b. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

For those looking to tap into the relative strength, three top-ranked stocks – Elevance Health ELV, McKesson Corp. MCK, and Humana HUM – could all be considered.As we can see in the chart below, shares of all three companies have been on a rock-solid run over the last month, easily outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.McKesson Corp. McKesson Corp. is a healthcare services and information technology company operating through two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MCK has a strong earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine of its last ten quarters. Revenue results have also consistently been better than expected, with MCK chaining together five consecutive top-line beats.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company rewards its shareholders with a small dividend; MCK’s annual dividend yields 0.6% paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at just 8% of earnings.The company has upped its dividend five times over the last five years, translating to a respectable 7.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson has witnessed favorable growth trends as well – in its latest quarter, revenue from its U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions (80% of net revenues in FY22) came in at $56.9 billion, reflecting a 14% Y/Y uptick and easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.7 billion.Story continuesHumana Humana is a health care plan provider in the United States, providing health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization, Private Fee-For-Service, and Preferred Provider Organization plans.Humana’s earnings outlook has turned bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 21% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 12% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 12% and 9% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MCK, Humana pays a small dividend; HUM’s annual dividend yield comes in at 0.6%, visibly lower than its Zacks Medical sector average.Still, the company’s 23.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s retail segment (66% of FY21 revenue) raked in $20.9 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 13% Y/Y uptick and to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.4 billion by 2%.Elevance HealthElevance Health Inc. operates as a health benefits company, supporting consumers, families, and communities across the entire care journey to lead healthier lives.ELV has found success as of late within its earnings releases, exceeding both top and bottom-line estimates in back-to-back quarters. In its latest print, the company registered a 6% EPS beat paired with a 1.3% revenue beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchElevance Health is forecasted to grow at a solid pace – earnings are forecasted to climb 11% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 13% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchELV’s Government Business segment (roughly 53% of FY21 revenue) grew 15% Y/Y and raked in $23.8 billion in its latest quarter thanks to the rise in Medicaid membership and higher premium rates of Medicare.Bottom LineThe Zacks Medical sector has been relatively strong over the last month, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 modestly.

328,91c10885-57e6-39f6-a84a-5bf09b63f4d7,MCK,2022-10-26,CVS Health (CVS) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-health-cvs-report-q3-163304641.html,1666715584,STORY,"['CVS', 'MCK', 'HUM']","[CVS Health Corporation CVS is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings of $2,40 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.11%. The company beat estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.74%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health’s retail/long-term care (LTC) segment is likely to have benefited from the enhanced pharmacy and front-store sales growth, similar to the second quarter. With economies reopening and infectious diseases still existing, the segment is likely to have witnessed continued sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits in the to-be-reported quarter. The retail segment has also been gaining from strength in paid membership programs. The company’s efforts to optimize the retail portfolio, which now consists of three models, including advanced primary care clinics, enhanced health hub locations and traditional CVS pharmacy locations, are likely to have been advantageous for upcoming Q3 results.Added to this, the company’s omnichannel approach is expected to have driven consumer satisfaction levels and enabled CVS Health to attract and retain customers in Q3.However, we expect this sales performance to have been impacted by lower demand for COVID-19 over-the-counter (OTC) test kits and vaccines due to a significant drop in COVID severity in the United States.CVS Health has been making noteworthy progress in terms of expanding access to care through digital and virtual channels. Per the August 2022 update, over 60% of its newly acquired digital users are customers of specialty, mail-order, and retail pharmacies. CVS Health’s contained efforts to expand digital health services and deepen engagement through personalization are expected to have broadened its customer base in Q3, thus adding to its top line.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCVS Health Corporation price-eps-surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteStory continuesThe company’s digital capabilities for health interactions, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products sales are anticipated to have enhanced consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.Our model suggests retail/LTC revenues of $25.05 billion for the third quarter.The pharmacy services segment is expected to have recorded robust sales growth, banking on increased pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled, especially with the growing uptake of cough and cold and beauty and personal care products. Added to this, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation is also likely to have been a contributing factor in the pharmacy services arm. The company pairs specialty pharmacy programs with digital capabilities to provide customers with a convenient and connected experience while driving value in the marketplace. CVS Health is also leveraging the power of analytics and robotics to automate prescriptions. This would simplify and accelerate the process of filling prescriptions, benefitting the business performance.Our model projects pharmacy services revenues of $40.91 billion for the third quarter.The healthcare benefits arm is likely to have been driven by sustained membership growth across all product lines. The Medicare franchise, particularly, has been delivering strong results for the company in the past years. We expect this growth momentum to continue, driving growth in the to-be-reported quarter. We also anticipate increased government memberships to have contributed to the segment’s top line. Further, CVS Health’s competitive cost structure, integrated benefit designs and innovative product portfolio position the healthcare benefits business for further growth.Per our model, the healthcare benefits segment is likely to deliver Q3 sales of $21.95 billion.Key Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.99 per share implies a 1% rise from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate for Q3 is $1.97.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $76.53 billion, suggesting 3.7% growth from the prior-year reported number. Our model projects revenues of $76.87 billion for Q3.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

It beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 13.00%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson’s fiscal second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $6.13, suggesting a decline of 0.3% from the prior-year quarter. The same for revenues stands at $69.66 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteMcKesson’s fiscal second-quarter results are expected to reflect segmental strength.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment might have acted as a key growth driver in the quarter to be reported. The consensus mark for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $57.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.8% from the prior-year quarter.The segment is likely to have benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, branded-to-generic conversions might have weighed on the segment’s performance. Nevertheless, the company’s broad spectrum of specialty biopharmaceutical providers and manufacturers is expected to have contributed to the fiscal second-quarter performance.Growth and improvement in the primary care business and contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program are likely to have positively impacted the company’s Medical-Surgical solutions segment.McKesson’s collaboration with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort highlighted the company’s role in the COVID-19 response. It was selected by the U.S. government as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those vaccines.Story continuesThe company’s U.S. and international distribution businesses have been playing a key role in the pandemic response. Meanwhile, its growing partnership with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts reflects operational excellence and capabilities.In July 2022, the U.S. government renewed the existing COVID-19 vaccine distribution contract.

330,6a95ffdc-f05f-31c3-9cce-8662d1a3fe09,MCK,2022-10-26,Abiomed (ABMD) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abiomed-abmd-report-q2-earnings-140902454.html,1666706942,STORY,"['ABMD', 'MCK', 'NVRO']","[Abiomed, Inc. ABMD is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 1, before market open.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.25 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.7%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 10.9%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Abiomed prior to this announcement.Factors to NoteDuring the fiscal 2023 first-quarter earnings call in August, Abiomed confirmed that Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist has been witnessing robust adoption over the past few months. The company also continued its successful controlled rollout of the Impella 5.5 in Japan during the last-reported quarter. The strong momentum is likely to have continued into the fiscal 2023 second quarter on the back of sustained adoption across the world, thereby significantly driving the overall top line.Over the past few months, Abiomed announced results for a few studies regarding Impella, all of which have demonstrated favorable results. This raises our optimism about the stock.Abiomed, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAbiomed, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAbiomed, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Abiomed, Inc. QuoteAbiomed’s Impella CP is also likely to have continued to witness strong customer adoption in the to-be-reported quarter due to its design which is expected to enable physicians to provide critical hemodynamic support to coronary artery disease patients. This, in turn, is expected to enable safer percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and complete revascularization, ultimately achieving the goal of improving their ejection fraction or heart function. This, along with Impella RP with SmartAssist, is likely to have driven up the fiscal second quarter revenues.During the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Abiomed confirmed that it witnessed strength in Europe (driven by strong patient growth in Austria, Belgium, Italy and the Middle East, and positive benefit from sales mix) and Japan businesses. The positive benefit from the sales mix the company derived from its European business in the last-reported quarter is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as Abiomed fully transitions to Impella CP with SmartAssist. In Japan, growth in patient utilization and site openings are likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. This is expected to have considerably pushed the company’s top line.Story continuesDuring the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Abiomed confirmed that its Abiomed 2.0 playbook has been demonstrating solid results on the back of its technology and round-the-clock hospital support addressing the growing incidences of heart disease in multiple emergency patient populations in the catheterization (cath) lab and surgical suite. In the last-reported quarter, Abiomed supported a record number of patients in the United States and had the second-highest patient utilization in Europe and Japan. The company also remains focused on innovation and strengthening clinical evidence. This momentum is likely to have continued in the fiscal second quarter, thereby driving up the quarterly top line.However, the company has been facing headwinds with COVID variants, hospital labor shortages, supply chain constraints and contrast media shortages for a while now. Also, Abiomed confirmed during its fiscal first quarter earnings call that the fiscal second quarter is usually a slow quarter for all cardiovascular devices due to a summertime slowdown in the cath lab. These are expected to have weighed on the company’s margin expansion in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Estimate PictureFor second-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273.3 million for Abiomed’s total revenues implies an improvement of 10.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Our projection of fiscal second-quarter revenue is currently pegged at $275.5 million, reflecting an uptick of 11% year over year.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.04    , indicating an improvement of 0.9% from the prior-year period’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Abiomed this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Abiomed has an Earnings ESP of +4.18%.

331,df3abcc2-c3f0-3538-83ba-ff8cb97d4cf4,MCK,2022-10-26,McKesson (MCK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-mck-expected-beat-earnings-140102396.html,1666706462,STORY,"['MCK', 'WST']","[The market expects McKesson (MCK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.3%.Revenues are expected to be $69.66 billion, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.52% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson?For McKesson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.27%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of $5.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.83, delivering a surprise of +9.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McKesson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, West Pharmaceutical Services (WST), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $730.64 million, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for West Pharmaceutical has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.51%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that West Pharmaceutical will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

332,a4f9a236-5d70-3974-ab98-912f5e16150d,MCK,2022-10-26,Ecolab (ECL) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecolab-ecl-report-q3-earnings-134401302.html,1666705441,STORY,"['ECL', 'MCK', 'NVRO']","[Ecolab, Inc. ECL is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.10 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and broke even the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 2.4%, on average.                  Let’s see how things have shaped up for Ecolab prior to this announcement:Global IndustrialThe Global Industrial segment witnessed a sales uptick in the second quarter of 2022. Water, Food &amp; Beverage, Paper and Downstream had recorded solid growth in the last-reported quarter, led by new business wins and accelerated total pricing. Per the company’s last-reported quarter’s earnings call, animal health and data centers have been performing quite well over the past few months. This momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter as well.During the second-quarter earnings call in July, Ecolab had confirmed that its Water business was continuing to register strong momentum. Rising water scarcity issues, need for net zero carbon and water, and rising demand for water are likely to keep the momentum going. This is expected to have considerably driven the third-quarter 2022 top line.Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEcolab Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEcolab Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ecolab Inc. QuoteNotable offerings from the company include the Peroxide Multi Surface Cleaner, Disinfectant for use against SARS-CoV-2, Sink &amp; Surface Cleaner Sanitizer and the Water Flow Intelligence, which are likely to have registered continued customer adoption in the third quarter, thereby pushing up revenues.Global Institutional &amp; SpecialtyEcolab’s Institutional &amp; Specialty segment recorded strong growth in the last-reported quarter, courtesy of the company’s performance in the Institutional and Specialty divisions. The Institutional division reflected robust volume gains, accelerating total pricing, good new business wins and innovation, which successfully leveraged global market trends. Specialty sales showed robust growth on the back of strong quickservice sales gains. This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter, thereby contributing to the overall top line.Story continuesEcolab's programs (including Ecolab Science Certified and Net Zero) are expected to provide its Industrial segment’s customers with improved ways to deliver on their commitments. In its second-quarter earnings call, the company had confirmed that it was experiencing significant progress via Net Zero. These trends are likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thus driving up revenues.However, Ecolab confirmed during its second-quarter earnings call that the dine-in traffic in the U.S. restaurants is still down. Although the traffic has considerably recovered, it is likely to remain down in the third quarter as well. This is expected to have partially weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Other Factors at WorkRising demand for Pest Elimination (a component of Ecolab’s broader Other segment) in food and beverage plants to avoid food safety issues is likely to have driven the segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. However, a higher energy surcharge due to increasing oil prices is likely to weigh on the third-quarter segmental revenues.On the international front, Ecolab had stated during its second-quarter earnings call that its Europe business has been doing well over the past few months. However, on the Eastern front, Ecolab’s China business is likely to be lower due to strict lockdown measures. Also, the current inflationary pressures, supply-chain constraints and high labor costs are likely to weigh on the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.68 billion for total revenues implies an improvement of 10.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Our projection of fiscal third-quarter revenue is currently pegged at $3.70 billion, reflecting an uptick of 11.6% year over year.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.33, implying a decline of 3.6% from the prior-year period’s reported number.Our projection of adjusted earnings per share is currently pegged at $1.32, reflecting a decline of 4.4% year over year.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has higher chances of beating estimates.

Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, and missed in one, the average beat being 20.10%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted Illumina’s third-quarter performance. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs might have weighed on the company's corporate profitability. The existing healthcare staffing challenges and diminishing demand for COVID-testing products might also have weighed on the company through the third quarter.Meanwhile, the extended lockdown issues in limited geographies, including Greater China, where the company has extensive business, are expected to have adversely impacted the top line during the third quarter.In this regard, we apprehend a reduction in COVID surveillance demand pulling back to have a negative impact on revenues in third-quarter 2022. In the second quarter, the significant decrease in mid-throughput shipments was primarily due to headwinds from COVID surveillance and COVID lockdowns in China, with NextSeq 1000, 2000 growth more than offset by a decrease in NextSeq 550.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllumina, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Over and above, the pending outcome of the European Commission's investigation into Illumina's acquisition of GRAIL, which was initiated in 2020, is putting enormous pressure on the company’s expenses. Other than the uncertainty surrounding GRAIL integration, these regulatory complications are raising legal expenses for Illumina, thereby building pressure on the bottom line. These are expected to have marred the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Story continuesOn a positive note, the ongoing substantial improvement in Core Illumina businesses and contributions from the GRAIL acquisition look encouraging so far. Illumina’s overall sequencing activity on connected instruments is expected to have been robust in the third quarter, on strong sequencing runs in its connected high- and mid-throughput instruments. NovaSeq consumable and instrument shipments in the quarter-to-be-reported are expected to have been promising. The continued strength in the company’s oncology markets is an added advantage contributing to its top line in the third quarter.The company ended the second quarter with a strong backlog of $1.1 billion. A part of this might have been processed in the third quarter, contributing to the sales growth.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, suggesting a 0.4% fall over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 29 cents indicates an 80% slash from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Genuine Parts (GPC) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this auto and industrial parts distributor a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Genuine Parts is 9.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 2.6%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Genuine Parts has an S/TA ratio of 1.35, which means that the company gets $1.35 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 1.05, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Genuine Parts looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 15.9% this year versus the industry average of 7.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Genuine Parts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.1% over the past month.Bottom LineGenuine Parts has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Genuine Parts well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the top line lagged the consensus mark of $22,323 million. The EV giant reported an overall gross margin of 25.1% for the reported quarter. Further, the operating margin came in at 17.2%. (Tesla Pulls Off 7th Consecutive Beat in Q3 Earnings)Winnebago reported adjusted earnings of $3.02 per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Aug 27, 2022). The bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.99 a share and rose 14% year over year. This outperformance can be attributed to higher-than-anticipated revenues and pre-tax income from the Motorhome and Marine segments. However, revenues of $1,179.1 million missed the consensus mark of $1,197.3 million but grew 14% year over year.Winnebago had cash and cash equivalents of $282.2 million as of Aug 27, 2022, down from $434.6 million on Aug 28, 2021.

Under the current share repurchase authorization, approximately $77 million remains available. (Lithia's Q3 Earnings Miss, SG&amp;A Expenses &amp; Debt Rise)Autoliv reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. This was due to lower-than-expected revenues from the Airbags/Associated Products and the Seatbelts/Associated Products segments. The bottom line, nevertheless, shot up 68% on a year-over-year basis. The company reported net sales of $2,302 million in the quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,344 million. The top line, however, soared 25% year over year.The company forecasts full-year 2022 organic sales growth of around 15%, compared with 13-16% guided previously. Adjusted operating margin is now anticipated within the higher end of 6-7%. Operating cash flow expectations have been brought down to the band of $700-$750 million from $750-$850 million forecast earlier.

The top line rose 17.8% year over year. The upside resulted from 12.7% growth in comparable sales and 9.1% benefit from acquisitions, partly offset by a net unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation to the tune of 4%.

Is Genuine Parts (GPC) one of those stocks right now? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Auto-Tires-Trucks peers, we might be able to answer that question.Genuine Parts is a member of our Auto-Tires-Trucks group, which includes 125 different companies and currently sits at #8 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Genuine Parts is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC's full-year earnings has moved 4.6% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.Based on the most recent data, GPC has returned 21.7% so far this year. At the same time, Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks have lost an average of 40.2%. This means that Genuine Parts is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.Another Auto-Tires-Trucks stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Modine (MOD). The stock has returned 53.7% year-to-date.For Modine, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 5% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).To break things down more, Genuine Parts belongs to the Automotive - Replacement Parts industry, a group that includes 7 individual companies and currently sits at #66 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has lost an average of 8.9% so far this year, so GPC is performing better in this area.Story continuesOn the other hand, Modine belongs to the Automotive - Original Equipment industry.

339,e2c8b66b-7df0-37f8-9573-10cea06ab4c7,GPC,2022-10-26,Genuine Parts Company (GPC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-company-gpc-hits-131501514.html,1666703701,STORY,['GPC'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of Genuine Parts (GPC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $170.61 in the previous session. Genuine Parts has gained 21.7% since the start of the year compared to the -40.2% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -8.9% return for the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 20, 2022, Genuine Parts reported EPS of $2.23 versus consensus estimate of $2.03 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.39%.For the current fiscal year, Genuine Parts is expected to post earnings of $8.18 per share on $21.88 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.38% change in EPS on a 15.94% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.66 per share on $22.42 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 5.94% and 2.49%, respectively.Valuation MetricsGenuine Parts may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Genuine Parts has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.9X versus its peer group's average of 10.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.65. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Genuine Parts currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Genuine Parts fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Genuine Parts shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

340,a2c7522d-b578-352d-8c6e-92f7299f0e57,FOX,2022-10-26,Fox (FOXA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-reports-next-week-140102867.html,1666706462,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox (FOXA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis TV broadcasting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.19 billion, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fox?For Fox, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fox will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fox would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of -5.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fox doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

New data showing layoffs are beginning to tick up again, and more could be on the way. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the details. And Allie, when you take a look at the media landscape, certainly changing over the last several years, to say the least. Now it looks like some of those headwinds that we've seen in over the last couple of months is going to continue into next year.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I think it's safe to say that media is an evolving business right now. There's that search for profitability. And then we have a lot of macroeconomic challenges as well-- foreign exchange pressure, losses of subscribers, and linear television, that slowdown in ad spending. And when you're looking to cut costs, layoffs is one strategy that a lot of these companies gravitate towards. We've seen many media companies from Netflix to CNN lay off employees.A reported 3,000 media jobs have been cut, with more than 1/3 coming from news media. I mentioned Warner Brothers Discovery. They're another major company that's dealt with intense cost cutting measures. Most recently, its television studio cut 26% of its headcount. And what you're seeing on your screen now is the news that we got yesterday in an SEC filing. The company plans to incur between $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring costs through 2024.The bulk of these charges, between 2 billion and 2.5 billion, are tied to restructuring the content side of the business. So think the cancellation of the nearly completed Batgirl film, removing a lot of that content that was in production in development. And ultimately, this is because David Zaslav wants to keep that promise that he made to Wall Street-- slash $3 billion of cost over the next two years. Not the Best Picture, though, heading into earnings next week.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Don't you want to see that Batgirl? Everybody wants to see that movie and to see how bad it was, but they literally wrote it off.ALLIE CANAL: The backlash from that has been crazy. You know Warner Brothers Discovery is saying, this was worth the tax writeoff.DAVE BRIGGS: It would smash if they released it because we all want to see how bad it is. Meanwhile, ""Game of Thrones,"" the spinoff, the numbers are in. What are we learning?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, the prequel coming in 9.3 million viewers in its season one finale. That's according to Warner Brothers Discovery. Now that includes both linear viewers and HBO Max streams. And it's the most watched finale for an HBO series since ""Game of Thrones."" That secured 19.8 million viewers in 2019.So didn't quite reach those levels, but still, this is a brand new show. It's a rookie season. It's garnered a lot of critical acclaim. And on Sunday, there was a lot of competition. We had Sunday Night Football. We had the ALCS playoff baseball game, which go, Phillies, if anyone [INAUDIBLE]SEANA SMITH: Of course, yes.ALLIE CANAL: Who I am rooting for in the World Series, but still, this is a great news for ""House of the Dragon"" and Warner Brothers Discovery, too. They really needed this to be a hit.SEANA SMITH: Go Phillies. You and I will be watching those games very closely. Allie, while we have you, we also got news Disney announcing its newest seasons of BBC's ""Doctor Who"" is going to actually be streaming on Disney+. How do you think that this, or do you think, is going to significantly help grow that viewership?ALLIE CANAL: I think it's important when we think about the global reach of Disney+. This is definitely a global play, since global audiences, outside of the UK and Ireland, are going to be able to watch this show on Disney+ beginning in late 2023. Now, previously, in the US, it aired on BBC America in recent years. I'm not sure if you guys are a fan of this show, but just judging off of the chatter that I saw online, it looks like worldwide, this does have some appeal. And as Disney is looking to sort of expand its reach overseas, this could be a good move for them.DAVE BRIGGS: This one really surprised me. I was shocked to see it trending. Is this a big deal, kids?SEANA SMITH: It is. It is. It has a very, very loyal fanbase, I will say that.ALLIE CANAL: I will say that, yeah.SEANA SMITH: And then you could also point to the fact that could then be a huge win for Disney+ because I think people-- that loyal fanbase will be willing to pay the extra subscription costs. But we have been debating when you're going to cut it off, when you're not. I think this--DAVE BRIGGS: It's all about these [INAUDIBLE].SEANA SMITH: --viewership-- yes, this viewership base will actually [INAUDIBLE].ALLIE CANAL: And think about something like ""Squid Games"" for Netflix. Some of that international IP can translate and really have this cross appeal in the US as well. So we'll have to see how this does.]"

(OKE) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-reports-next-140102801.html,1666706462,STORY,['OKE'],"[Oneok Inc. (OKE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.52 billion, up 43.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.67% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oneok?For Oneok, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oneok will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oneok would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +9.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Oneok doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I think Adidas will retain some of the sales. They will not lose that $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of Yeezy sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not being branded under that brand as well.""In ending their relationship, Adidas will have a huge hole to fill financially: The popular Yeezy line represents about $1 billion to $2 billion in annual sales for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad.A pair of Yeezy shoes from Adidas are seen in a Foot Locker store in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonAdidas severed ties with Ye on Tuesday morning after a spate of antisemitic comments by the musician-turned-designer in recent weeks.""Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech,"" the German company said in a statement. ""Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. After a thorough review, the company has taken the decision to terminate the partnership with Ye immediately, end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies. Adidas will stop the adidas Yeezy business with immediate effect.""Adidas stock fell 3% on the news and is down about 65% so far in 2022.Adidas noted that it would miss out on $250 million in profits this year as a result of the decision.""This is coming at a tough time for the company,"" Sherman said. ""They had their second of two early earnings releases and guidedowns for the year. They are expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway... and this $250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4.""Aside from the West drama, Adidas is entering into the holiday season wounded as the latest retailer to get caught flat-footed operationally as global economies have slowed. That poor execution has primarily led to a glut of Adidas inventory that will have to be aggressively marked down at the expense of profits, the company warned a week ago.Story continues""The company’s new outlook takes into account a further deterioration of traffic trends in Greater China as well as a significant inventory build-up as a result of lower consumer demand in major Western markets since the beginning of September, which is expected to lead to higher promotional activity during the remainder of the year,"" Adidas stated on October 20.Adidas merchandise in Garden City, New York on October 25, 2022.Evercore ISI's Omar Saad believes Adidas shares will be dead money as it works through excess inventory and also searches for a new CEO to replace long-time leader Kaspar Rorsted in 2023.""Adidas has been significantly underperforming in China before and through the pandemic (China sales 55% vs. pre-pandemic levels vs Nike 87%), and that divergence appears to be widening,"" Saad explained.

(NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.""Organizations across the globe have embraced and accelerated digital transformation to improve efficiency and to deliver the extraordinary digital experiences that are significant drivers of their businesses. In a challenging macro environment, these efforts take on new importance,"" said François Locoh-Donou, F5’s President and CEO. ""F5’s solutions automate, secure, and manage our customers’ rapidly expanding application footprints and evolving hybrid IT environments, enabling our customers to focus fewer resources on managing their IT infrastructure and more resources on running and growing their businesses.""Fiscal Year 2022 Performance SummaryFiscal year 2022 GAAP revenue grew 4%, to $2.7 billion, up from $2.6 billion in the year ago period. Fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP revenue grew 3%, to $2.7 billion, up from $2.6 billion in fiscal year 2021. Product revenue grew 6% from the year-ago period, including 33% software revenue growth. Systems revenue declined 13% from the year-ago period as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Global services revenue grew 2% from the year-ago period.GAAP net income for fiscal year 2022 was $322 million, or $5.27 per diluted share, compared to $331 million, or $5.34 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2021.Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2022 was $623 million, or $10.19 per diluted share, compared to $671 million, or $10.81 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2021.Fourth Quarter Performance SummaryFourth quarter fiscal year 2022 revenue grew 3% from the year ago period, to $700 million, up from $682 million in fiscal year 2021. Product revenue grew 3% from the year-ago period, including 13% software revenue growth. Systems revenue declined 5% from the year-ago period as a result of ongoing semiconductor shortages. Global services revenue grew 2% from the year-ago period.Story continuesGAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $89 million, or $1.49 per diluted share compared to net income of $111 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2021.Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $158 million, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared to $185 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2021.A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the attached Consolidated Income Statements. Additional information about non-GAAP financial information is included in this release.Business Outlook""Over the next year, our business is likely to benefit from tailwinds to our systems business as a result of improving component availability and to bear some weight from macroeconomic headwinds. In the balance, we expect to deliver fiscal year 2023 revenue growth of 9% to 11%,"" continued Locoh-Donou. ""We also expect the combination of revenue growth and operating leverage will enable us to deliver non-GAAP earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens in fiscal year 2023.""For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, F5 expects to deliver revenue in the range of $690 million to $710 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $2.25 to $2.37 per diluted share.All forward-looking non-GAAP measures included in the Company’s business outlook exclude estimates for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations (including the impact of income tax reform), non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions, and do not include the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures, acquisition-related charges and write-downs, restructuring charges, facility exit costs, or other non-recurring charges that may occur in the period. F5 is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have historically varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Live Webcast and Conference CallF5 will host a live webcast and conference call to review its financial results and outlook today, October 25, 2022, at 4:30 pm ET.

These, and other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and other factors that, if they do not fully materialize or prove correct, could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of offerings; continued disruptions to the global supply chain resulting in inability to source required parts for F5’s products or the ability to only do so at greatly increased prices thereby impacting our revenues and/or margins; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; F5’s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses’ products with F5 technologies; the ability of F5’s sales professionals and distribution partners to sell new solutions and service offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures, industry consolidation, entry of new competitors into F5’s markets, and new product and marketing initiatives by our competitors; increased sales discounts; the business impact of the acquisitions and potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of completion of acquisitions; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; potential security flaws in the Company’s networks, products or services; cybersecurity attacks on its networks, products or services; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; F5’s ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5’s ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5’s ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5’s sales cycle; the ability of F5 to execute on its share repurchase program including the timing of any repurchases; future prices of F5’s common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and other documents that we may file or furnish from time to time, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in F5’s most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.GAAP to non-GAAP ReconciliationF5’s management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations, and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, restructuring charges, facility-exit costs, significant litigation and other contingencies and certain non-recurring tax expenses and benefits, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the Company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the Company’s tax liability.The non-GAAP adjustments, and F5's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Acquisition-related write-downs of assumed deferred revenue. Included in its GAAP financial statements, F5 records acquisition-related write-downs of assumed deferred revenue to fair value, which results in lower recognized revenue over the term of the contract. F5 includes revenue associated with acquisition-related write-downs of assumed deferred revenue in its non-GAAP financial measures as management believes it provides a more accurate depiction of revenue arising from our strategic acquisitions.Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation consists of expense for stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchases through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of F5’s employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate comparison of the Company’s results to those of peer companies.Amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. On a non-recurring basis, when certain events or circumstances are present, management may also be required to write down the carrying value of its purchased intangible assets and recognize impairment charges. Management does not believe these charges accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations; therefore, they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. However, investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to F5’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to F5’s future period revenues as well.Facility-exit costs. F5 has incurred charges in connection with the exit of facilities as well as other non-recurring lease activity. These charges are not representative of ongoing costs to the business and are not expected to recur. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.Acquisition-related charges, net. F5 does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms and scope of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. F5 excludes acquisition-related charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies. Acquisition-related charges consist of planning, execution and integration costs incurred directly as a result of an acquisition.Impairment charges. In fiscal year 2021, F5 recorded impairment charges related to the permanent exit of certain floors at its Seattle headquarters. These charges are not representative of ongoing costs to the business and are not expected to recur. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.Restructuring charges. F5 has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and costs associated with exiting facility-lease commitments. F5 excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measures of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business and is used by management in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the Company provides investors these supplemental measures since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and financial results.For reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section in our attached Condensed Consolidated Income Statements entitled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures.""About F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to optimize and secure every app and API anywhere, including on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Colgate-Palmolive hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive peKeen to find out how analysts think Colgate-Palmolive's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Colgate-Palmolive's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 28% decrease to the company's bottom line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 11% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 17% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.3% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Colgate-Palmolive's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Colgate-Palmolive's P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Colgate-Palmolive's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Colgate-Palmolive.

361,93869051-877a-3376-a265-79340b6a85fa,CL,2022-10-26,Clorox (CLX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clorox-clx-expected-beat-earnings-140102428.html,1666706462,STORY,"['CLX', 'CL']","[The market expects Clorox (CLX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.69 billion, down 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clorox?For Clorox, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Clorox will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Clorox would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.93, delivering a surprise of -2.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Clorox appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, Colgate-Palmolive (CL), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -8.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.5 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Colgate-Palmolive has been revised 2.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.29%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Colgate-Palmolive will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

363,1ab2a5f7-29ac-3e89-a606-2875189e685f,JNPR,2022-10-26,Juniper Networks (JNPR) Surpasses Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-jnpr-surpasses-q3-213509360.html,1666733709,STORY,"['JNPR', 'MSI']","[Juniper Networks (JNPR) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.46 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this computer network equipment maker would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of -6.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Juniper , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.41 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.72%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Juniper shares have lost about 20.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Juniper?While Juniper has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Juniper: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.63 on $1.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.85 on $5.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless Equipment is currently in the top 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Motorola (MSI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This communications equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Motorola's revenues are expected to be $2.31 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

364,579302d8-ce3a-3375-85f9-0875ea826ba6,JNPR,2022-10-26,Juniper Networks Reports Preliminary Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-reports-preliminary-third-201500881.html,1666728900,STORY,['JNPR'],"[SUNNYVALE, Calif., October 25, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR), a leader in secure, AI-driven networks, today reported preliminary financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and provided its outlook for the three months ending December 31, 2022.Third Quarter 2022 Financial PerformanceNet revenues were $1,414.6 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and an increase of 11% sequentially.GAAP operating margin was 10.6%, an increase from 10.1% in the third quarter of 2021, and an increase from 8.5% in the second quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, an increase from 16.6% in the third quarter of 2021, and an increase from 13.9% in the second quarter of 2022.GAAP net income was $121.5 million, an increase of 37% year-over-year, and an increase of 7% sequentially, resulting in diluted net income per share of $0.37.Non-GAAP net income was $190.8 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year, and an increase of 40% sequentially, resulting in non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.58.The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided in a table immediately following the Preliminary Net Revenues by Geographic Region table below.""We delivered record revenue results during the September quarter. Product sales grew 25% year-over-year and we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all customer verticals and all customer solutions,"" said Juniper’s CEO, Rami Rahim. ""Our teams are executing extremely well. Based on our current demand, our strong backlog and the actions we’ve taken to procure more supply, we expect to deliver continued revenue strength in Q4, and sustained growth in 2023 and beyond.""""We had very strong financial performance in Q3, as revenue and non-GAAP EPS both exceeded the high-end of our guidance range,"" said Juniper’s CFO, Ken Miller. ""Non-GAAP gross and operating margins also came in ahead of our forecast and we see the potential to expand profitability in 2023.""Story continuesBalance Sheet and Other Financial ResultsTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2022 were $1,254.9 million, compared to $1,835.8 million as of September 30, 2021, and $1,285.6 million as of June 30, 2022.Cash flows provided by operations for the third quarter of 2022 were $51.8 million, compared to $136.7 million of cash flows provided by operations in the third quarter of 2021, and $266.9 million of cash flows used in operations in the second quarter of 2022.Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 65 days in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 59 days in the third quarter of 2021, and 74 days in the second quarter of 2022.Capital expenditures were $23.9 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $52.7 million during the third quarter of 2022.OutlookThese metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Non-GAAP earnings per share is on a fully diluted basis. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels.There is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges, which have resulted in extended lead times, as well as elevated logistics and component costs. We continue to work to resolve supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels and purchase commitments. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will persist into 2023. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components to meet our financial forecast.For the fourth quarter, we expect to see solid revenue growth driven by the strength of our demand forecast, our backlog, and an improved supply outlook.Our guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2022 is as follows:Revenue will be approximately $1,475 million, plus or minus $50 million.Non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 57.0%, plus or minus 1.0%.Non-GAAP operating expenses will be approximately $575 million, plus or minus $5 million.Non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately 18.0% at the mid-point of revenue guidance.Non-GAAP other income and expense (OI&amp;E) will be near Q3'22 levels.Non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19.0%.Non-GAAP net income per share will be approximately $0.64, plus or minus $0.05. This assumes a share count of approximately 330 million shares.For more detailed insight on guidance, please refer to the CFO Commentary that can be found on our website.Capital ReturnOur Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid on December 22, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2022. We remain committed to paying our dividend and remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks.Third Quarter 2022 Financial Commentary Available OnlineA CFO Commentary reviewing the Company’s third quarter 2022 financial results, as well as the fourth quarter and full-year 2022 outlook will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the Company’s website at http://investor.juniper.net.

Actual results or events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including: the duration, extent and continuing impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; general economic and political conditions globally or regionally, including adverse changes in China-Taiwan relations and any impact due to armed conflicts (such as the continuing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as governmental sanctions imposed in response); inflationary pressures; business and economic conditions in the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending by our customers; the network capacity and security requirements of our customers and, in particular, Cloud and telecommunication service providers; contractual terms that may result in the deferral of revenue; the timing of orders and their fulfillment; continuing manufacturing and supply chain challenges and logistics costs, constraints, changes or disruptions; availability and pricing of key product components, such as semiconductors; delays in scheduled product availability; our customers canceling orders that are included in the calculation of backlog, which they may do without significant penalty; adoption of or changes to laws, regulations, standards or policies affecting Juniper Networks' operations, products, services or the networking industry; product defects, returns or vulnerabilities; significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of new tax regulations, including the potential for corporate tax increases and changes to global tax laws; legal settlements and resolutions, including with respect to enforcing our proprietary rights; the potential impact of activities related to the execution of capital return, restructurings and product rationalization; the impact of import tariffs and changes thereto; and other factors listed in Juniper Networks’ most recent report on Form 10-Q or 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, many of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are, and could be, exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result of the pandemic. We cannot at this time predict the extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting business or economic impact, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

All statements made in this press release are made only as of the date set forth at the beginning of this release. Juniper Networks undertakes no obligation to update the information made in this release in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this press release. We have not filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. As a result, all financial results described in this earnings release should be considered preliminary, and are subject to change to reflect any necessary adjustments or changes in accounting estimates, that are identified prior to the time we file our Form 10-Q.All forward-looking non-GAAP measures exclude estimates for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, acquisition, divestiture, and strategic investment related charges, restructuring benefits or charges, impairment charges, strategic partnership-related charges, legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits, gain or loss on equity investments, loss on extinguishment of debt, retroactive impact of certain tax settlements, significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform, non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions, and do not include the impact of further changes to tariffs and the impact of any future acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures that may occur in the period. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have historically varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Net revenues:Product$967.5$771.9$2,551.6$2,203.5Service447.1416.91,300.81,232.0Total net revenues1,414.61,188.83,852.43,435.5Cost of revenues:Product478.6343.41,289.01,010.3Service148.2153.2432.1435.5Total cost of revenues626.8496.61,721.11,445.8Gross margin787.8692.22,131.31,989.7Operating expenses:Research and development274.0251.8766.9752.3Sales and marketing286.8263.4834.4773.9General and administrative64.755.0192.1187.1Restructuring charges13.01.922.342.8Total operating expenses638.5572.11,815.71,756.1Operating income149.3120.1315.6233.6Gain on divestiture——45.8—Loss on extinguishment of debt———(60.6)Other expense, net(9.1)(8.3)(30.1)(24.2)Income before income taxes and loss from equity method investment140.2111.8331.3148.8Income tax provision16.622.938.129.0Loss from equity method investment, net of tax2.1—2.6—Net income$121.5$88.9$290.6$119.8Net income per share:Basic$0.38$0.27$0.90$0.37Diluted$0.37$0.27$0.88$0.36Weighted-average shares used to compute net income per share:Basic322.8324.0321.8325.0Diluted328.9331.1329.3331.4Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Net Revenues by Customer Solution(in millions)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Customer Solutions:Automated WAN Solutions$532.7$384.5$1,386.3$1,167.0Cloud-Ready Data Center229.3194.7619.0554.0AI-Driven Enterprise266.6229.8707.9586.1Hardware Maintenance and Professional Services386.0379.81,139.21,128.4Total$1,414.6$1,188.8$3,852.4$3,435.5Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Net Revenues by Vertical(in millions)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Cloud$375.3$303.3$1,013.3$894.6Service Provider523.1445.81,421.91,327.7Enterprise516.2439.71,417.21,213.2Total$1,414.6$1,188.8$3,852.4$3,435.5Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Net Revenues by Geographic Region(in millions)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Americas$895.8$664.8$2,299.4$1,900.5Europe, Middle East, and Africa320.4336.3991.5971.3Asia Pacific198.4187.7561.5563.7Total$1,414.6$1,188.8$3,852.4$3,435.5Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures(in millions, except percentages and per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022June 30, 2022September 30, 2021GAAP operating income$149.3$107.8$120.1GAAP operating margin10.6%8.5%10.1%Share-based compensation expenseC61.547.254.9Share-based payroll tax expenseC2.12.01.0Amortization of purchased intangible assetsA18.419.520.1Restructuring chargesB13.00.51.9Acquisition related chargesA(0.5)0.8(0.2)Loss on non-qualified deferred compensation plan (""NQDC"")B(1.0)(4.8)—OthersB0.93.9—Non-GAAP operating income$243.7$176.9$197.8Non-GAAP operating margin17.2%13.9%16.6%GAAP net income$121.5$113.4$88.9Share-based compensation expenseC61.547.254.9Share-based payroll tax expenseC2.12.01.0Amortization of purchased intangible assetsA18.419.520.1Restructuring chargesB13.00.51.9Acquisition related chargesA(0.5)0.8(0.2)Gain on divestitureB—(45.8)—Gain on equity investmentsB—(5.6)(0.7)Loss from equity method investmentB2.10.5—Income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusionsB(28.2)—(13.9)OthersB0.93.9—Non-GAAP net income$190.8$136.4$152.0GAAP diluted net income per share$0.37$0.35$0.27Non-GAAP diluted net income per shareD$0.58$0.42$0.46Shares used in computing diluted net income per share328.9328.1331.1Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresJuniper Networks believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s financial condition and results of operations. Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading.This press release, including the tables above, includes the following non-GAAP financial measures derived from our Preliminary Consolidated Statements of Operations: operating income; operating margin; net income; and diluted net income per share. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the ""Outlook"" section above.The above tables and reconciliations can also be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net.Note A: Acquisition Related Charges. We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions results in recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.Note B: Other Items. We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i) strategic investment-related gain or loss, including gain or loss from our equity method investment; (ii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iii) gain or loss on significant isolated events or transactions, including divestitures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are directly related to the events, objectively quantifiable, and not expected to occur regularly in the future that are not indicative of our core operating results; (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt; (v) significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; and (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the non-GAAP results exclude the effects of NQDC-related investments. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.In addition, we exclude restructuring benefits or charges as these result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. As such, we believe these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred or comparisons to past operating results. We also exclude gains or losses related to the strategic investments as well as significant isolated events as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, certain items related to global tax reform may continue to impact the business and are generally unrelated to the current level of business activity. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation on our results of operations.

In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corporation (DHR), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates. The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range. This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary. A case in point is this mornig's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary. With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along. S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st. Story continuesFull year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down.

High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company’s operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes. Adverse foreign currency movements are affecting Danaher’s top line.However, strong segmental performances are driving Danaher’s growth. Robust activity in bioprocessing and strength in instrument business are boosting the Life Sciences unit’s performance. Robust growth in Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics is acting as a catalyst to the Diagnostics segment’s growth. Inorganic activities are contributing to the company’s top line growth. Danaher’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Comcast shares have declined -42.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -47.0%.

Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.Though Comcast is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base. Slowing broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.Nevertheless, Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have underperformed against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -13.5%). The company’s performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. The company believes that performance will be under massive pressure for the rest of the year.However, Starbucks has been benefiting from operating fundamentals such as a solid global footprint, successful innovations and digital offerings.

First Solar has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.74%, on average. Factors to NoteStrong bookings, customer growth and solid shipments are expected to have contributed to the third-quarter sales of the company. Additionally, the increased demand for solar modules and sales freight recoveries is expected to have contributed to FSLR’s top line in the third quarter.Moreover, sale proceeds from the divestment of its operating &amp; maintenance platforms in Japan might have contributed to the performance of First Solar’s top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $761.9 million, suggesting growth of 30.6% from the year-ago reported figure.From the cost perspective, headwinds, like inflationary pressure, higher freight and fuel costs and increased production start-up expenses, might have dampened the earnings of the company in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Also, higher impairment charges due to Japan’s operating &amp; maintenance platforms are likely to have dampened FSLR’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for First Solar’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at a loss of 25 cents per share, suggesting a deterioration from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings.First Solar, Inc.

371,bd06aadc-17cc-3fc1-a6e3-90c9b22438f5,DVN,2022-10-26,Devon Energy (DVN) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-dvn-reports-next-140202294.html,1666706522,STORY,['DVN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Devon Energy (DVN) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +97.2%.Revenues are expected to be $4.91 billion, up 41.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy?For Devon Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Devon Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of $2.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering a surprise of +8.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Devon Energy appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jan 23, 2023 $4.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Devon Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.25 per share to $2.13 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Devon Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

373,332aebd1-7eda-3281-a7f3-e4b90d7ba068,DVN,2022-10-26,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-attracting-130001516.html,1666702801,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +36.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 22.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +97.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.88 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +151.6%. This estimate has changed -3.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.64 indicates a change of +8.5% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +41.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.75 billion and $20.2 billion estimates indicate +65.8% and +2.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +132.8%. EPS of $2.59 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +17.26%. The EPS surprise was +8.82%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Salesforce, Inc., UPS and Devon Energy Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Salesforce shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-45.5% vs. -28.2%). This reflects fears in the market about enterprise spending slowdown in response to the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Other headwinds include stiff competition, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver.The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in the enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft's Teams product.

But what sets UPS apart from FedEx and others is a track record of operating excellence and ability to generate strong cash flows. The ability to pass on higher costs to customers through increased shipping rates should help profitability to some extent. Longer term, UPS remains well positioned to capitalize on the favorable outlook for ecommerce growth.In first-half 2022, UPS generated free cash flows of $6,895 million compared with $6,804 million in first-half 2021. UPS paid out dividends worth $3,437 million in 2021, up 1.9% year over year.

This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.34%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment bank would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.88, delivering a surprise of 10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PJT Partners , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $266.09 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $231.3 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PJT Partners shares have added about 1.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for PJT Partners?While PJT Partners has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PJT Partners: unfavorable.

The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 31.7% from the year-ago level.

Earlier, WY had expected Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to second-quarter 2022.WY now expects Timberlands earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the year-ago period, driven mainly by the work stoppage. It previously expected Timberlands adjusted EBITDA to sequentially lower but ""moderately higher"" from the year-ago period.Meanwhile, WY has kept the guidance for its Real Estate, Energy &amp; Natural Resources businesses unchanged. Weyerhaeuser’s earnings and adjusted EBITDA ares expected to be marginally lower than the year-ago period.Overall, lower lumber and OSB prices are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s third-quarter 2022 performance despite operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves of the company.Meanwhile, transportation and resin shortages have been a headwind for the Wood business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer may have also been a pressing concern.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wood Products segment (contributing approximately 78% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $1,797 million, implying a decrease from $1,853 million in the year-ago period and $2,341 million in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Timberland segment (contributing approximately 26% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $485 million, implying a decrease from $541 million in the year-ago period and $671 million in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment revenues is pegged at $67 million, implying a decline from $69 million a year ago and from $117 million in the prior quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Weyerhaeuser this time around.

In response, 77% of consumers already have, or plan to, shop early to ensure they can get the items they want and have more time to shop for deals. Nearly 60% of shoppers said current economic factors will cause them to spend less overall and 71% said they would consider a store financing or payment plan to cover the costs of gifts. Ultimately, shoppers are ready to hit buy if the price is right, with 47% of people noting that cost will be the main factor in moving them from a browser to a buyer. (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Next to inventory availability, price is the leading factor in how and where consumers will shop this holiday season,"" said Mike Webster, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Retail. ""For retailers still dealing with the constant loop of limited inventory supplies or surpluses, getting merchandise and pricing strategies right will be make or break when it comes to managing margins and customer expectations.""The survey polled 8,107 global consumers across 11 different countries in late September 2022, including 1,000 people in the United States. The Untold Insights survey asked consumers about holiday shopping plans and their post-pandemic retail habits. Unwrap your complimentary copy of the Retail Shopper Outlook: Consumer Research 2022 report.The price is rightSome 34% of people are worried they won't have the money they would like to spend on holiday shopping due to rising commodity prices and 36% are concerned that the gifts they want to buy will be more expensive this year. As such, shoppers are committing extra time to finding the best deal and are considering payment plans to check items off their gift list.Story continues71% of shoppers said they would consider a store financing or payment plan to pay for gifts over time (25% of people said they have never used one of these plans before)77% said they will shop around for more deals and discounts71% said they would wait for big sales moments and store holiday sales from their favorite retailers75% said they would do more price comparisons online and in-stores73% said they would look to shop at more discount stores (such as TJMaxx and ROSS)Nearly three-quarters of people (71%) also plan to wait for big retail sales moments. While Black Friday still takes the crown with 47% of shoppers planning to participate, not far behind are Amazon Prime Days (43%) and after holiday sales (30%).Making a list, checking it twiceTired of staying in, shoppers are eager to give the gift of experiences this year. Top gifts consumers plan to buy more of this holiday season include:34% Experiences with friends and family30% Fashion apparel29% Gift cards29% Beauty/personal care products28% Footwear28% Electronics26% Toys20% Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or digital collectablesStores are back, will the inventory be there?With restrictions largely lifted, people are heading back to stores to holiday shop, but expectations for inventory availability remain high.43% of people plan to shop mostly in store and 23% in store and online29% of people said out-of-stock items would constitute a bad experience22% said they would simply go to another retailer if a product was not in stock""Merchandise in the wrong place at the wrong time can be the biggest cost to a retailer,"" added Webster. ""We know that out-of-stock inventory compromises top line growth and customer satisfaction. Equally as important is its impact on margins. Retailers must be proactive in their placement of inventory as they consider size, style, and color of the assortment to avoid massive store-to-store transfer costs.""Delivery demandsHome delivery (56%) is still by far the most popular method to collect items bought online, compared to curbside (21%) or in-store pick up (16%). This creates urgency for retailers to ensure gifts are delivered on time, while providing clear transparency along the way.47% of people said fast delivery often determines who they will order from25% fear that gifts won't arrive on time62% are willing to pay more for expedited/guaranteed delivery61% would consider booking a standalone delivery/collection service (like a DoorDash) to ensure they get their gifts on time""With consumers headed back to stores, retailers must create an endless aisle experience,"" said Webster. ""Whether this means an associate helping an in-store shopper find an item online and shipping it to their home or giving online shoppers an accurate view of product availability at their nearest physical location. To maintain loyalty, nearly every interaction needs to end with the consumer getting the product they want in time for the holidays. And that execution begins with order transparency.""Influencers not that influentialSocial media continues to play a larger role in how consumers discover new offers, products, and brands. In 2022, social media jumped to the top spot (21%) in how consumers find the most compelling offers and products, followed by email at 19% (up from 10% in 2021), and in-store promotions at 15%.Shoppers preferred social platforms include:Despite the hype, less than 1% of consumers turn to the metaverse to discover new products. And despite the rise in influencer B2C marketing, only 12% of consumers noted that seeing their favorite influencers suggest a product as the reason for them to hit the buy.Returns in, regifting outMore than half of consumers said they anticipate returning some gifts this year, with 30% saying they would return half to all of them.48% of people prefer to take their returns to the store, with 29% choosing to mail returns to the retailer54% of global consumers make their returns within a week, 24% return immediately, 14% return within a month, 8% of shoppers rarely make returns, often forgetting to make them at allParents (33%) more likely to mail back their returns than shoppers without kids (24%)Men (32%) are more likely to make their returns immediately than women (26%)""With many retailers beginning to charge for returns and over a quarter of shoppers already planning to make them, this holiday season could be end up as a detriment to customer loyalty,"" noted Webster. ""While a return fee makes economic sense, retailers are likely to meet resistance from buyers who will be annoyed by the added cost and less likely to use the return opportunity to browse and buy additional items.""Unwrap your complimentary copy of the Retail Shopper Outlook: Consumer Research 2022 report, and learn more about how Oracle Retail is helping retailers brace for the holiday rush and use data science to provide a holistic view of shopper interactions to make better inventory buying decisions and deliver more relevant offers to customers.*Gen Z (18-24); Millennials (25-39); Gen X (40-54); Boomers (55+)About OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

The new location will provide direct connectivity between the Oracle Cloud Johannesburg region and the Microsoft Azure South Africa North region.With the latest Oracle Interconnect for Microsoft Azure, organizations across Africa can now use the Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure.This Oracle service builds upon the core capabilities of Oracle Interconnect for Microsoft Azure and enables customers to easily integrate workloads on Azure with Oracle Database service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).In July, Oracle announced the general availability of Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure. With this new offering, Microsoft Azure customers can easily provision, access and monitor enterprise-grade Oracle Database service in OCI with a familiar experience. Users can migrate or build new applications on Azure and then connect to the high-performance, high-availability, managed Oracle Database service such as Autonomous Database running on OCI.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteOracle’s Longstanding Partnership With Microsoft: A Key CatalystSince 2019, Oracle and Microsoft have partnered to deliver 12 Oracle Interconnect for Microsoft Azure locations around the world, including San Jose, Phoenix, Ashburn, Toronto, Vinhedo, Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, and Johannesburg. These locations offer customers multi-cloud capabilities to run their business-critical applications.According to Walker, the total spending on public cloud services in South Africa is forecast to witness a five-year CAGR of 24.6% from 2021 to 2026.The announcement comes after Oracle opened its Johannesburg-based data center in January — its first cloud region on the African continent.The cloud region allows organizations looking to build high-performing, secure applications to meet data sovereignty requirements and devise disaster recovery plans to cater to the demand for enterprise cloud services across the continent.Story continuesIncreasing Costs &amp; Competition to Hurt Balance SheetAcquisitions have played an important part in Oracle’s growth trajectory over the years. Being a late entrant in the cloud computing space, the company is trying to build its position through aggressive acquisitions. The company is making significant investments in these acquisitions in order to catch up with Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet-owned GOOGL Cloud, salesforce and IBM.Amazon continues to dominate the global cloud computing space on the back of an increasing number of availability zones and regions served by Amazon Web Services as it recently opened one in Bangkok, Thailand.Alphabet’s Google Cloud services have been growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI. It is expanding its footprint worldwide as the company is about to open a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia.As the SaaS market is getting overcrowded, we believe that all acquisitions may not perform as per Oracle’s expectations, which will eventually hurt this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s profitability.Large acquisitions can negatively impact the company’s balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $74.1 billion as of Aug 31, 2022, up from $45.5 billion in the previous quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect Micron to post earnings of $0.04 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 98.15%.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Eric Andersen, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$283 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$285, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 5.7% of Eric Andersen's stake.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 4.60k shares for US$1.3m. But they sold 12.15k shares for US$3.5m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Aon shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Aon better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Aon Have Sold Stock RecentlyThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of Aon shares over the last three months. In total, Chief Accounting Officer Michael Neller sold US$256k worth of shares in that time. On the other hand we note insider Byron Spruell bought US$117k worth of shares. Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.Story continuesDoes Aon Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Aon insiders own 1.1% of the company, currently worth about US$674m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Aon Insiders?The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Aon, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Aon (1 is a bit concerning!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

386,f51ac549-76cc-3b09-88d6-d5de03904b82,MCD,2022-10-26,"With 69% ownership, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/69-ownership-mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-120021121.html,1666785621,STORY,['MCD'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 69% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McDonald's. See our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in McDonald's. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at McDonald's' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McDonald's. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$177m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 31% stake in McDonald's. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with McDonald's , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

390,239b2d74-997e-39a1-b0dc-406926e4a1a1,MCD,2022-10-26,Earnings Preview: Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-cheesecake-factory-cake-140102878.html,1666706462,STORY,"['CAKE', 'MCD']","[Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis restaurant chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.9%.Revenues are expected to be $799.33 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.66% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cheesecake Factory?For Cheesecake Factory, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.17%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cheesecake Factory will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cheesecake Factory would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.52, delivering a surprise of -33.33%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cheesecake Factory doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, McDonald's (MCD) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.71 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 1.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.30%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today hosted its annual GROUNDBREAKERS thought leadership forum featuring leaders in global commerce, energy, logistics and supply chain transformation at The Shed in New York's Hudson Yards.To kick off the day, Prologis Co-founder and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam and Dave Clark, co-CEO of Flexport and former CEO of Amazon Consumer Worldwide, engaged in conversation with Susie Gharib, anchor and senior special correspondent Fortune. The three examined the once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a customer-centric, transparent, and high-performance global supply chain, and discussed the current economic environment.Clark shared insight on successfully managing a company while facing challenging economic headwinds: ""You really have to focus on the thing that's most important to the customer and most important to future growth so that when you come out the other side, you're ready to take an outside share of whatever the new world is going to be. For us, that's a big technology investment over the next year or two.""Going beyond the economy, conversations focused on the supply chain's role in the global climate future. Multiple companies and countries have committed to climate action over the next three decades with commitment to get to net zero emissions before 2050 – including Prologis.With this as the backdrop, Annette Clayton, CEO North America of Schneider Electric, Moghadam and Gharib had a wide-ranging discussion about the impact of these climate commitments as well as the opportunities, challenges and progress energy transformation hold for today and in the future.""Our customers are serious about ESG and the larger ones have very sophisticated approaches to it. But the vast majority of our customers are small and medium with one or two locations,"" said Moghadam, reflecting on the customer value of sustainability. ""They don't have a chief sustainability officer, they don't have big enough staff to do this, so they really look to us and other players in the supply chain to provide it to them.""Story continuesClayton was clear that she views sustainability as a business imperative.""If you're on a board or an investor at a company that's not working on decarbonization, what does that really say about the resilience of your particular enterprise?"" Clayton asked. ""I would contend if we cycle out 10 years, maybe 20 years, that enterprise may not be viable if they don't have some sort of decarbonization plan.""As companies look to bridge economies and upskill their workforces, technology continues to be a driving force in companies' capital investment, human resource and supply chain strategies. Businesses are exploring creative ways to use automation, artificial intelligence-driven predictive analytics and drones to enhance visibility across the supply chain, agreed the group of experts discussing the future of fulfillment at Tuesday's forum. Moderated by New York Times contributor Ben Ryder Howe, the panel featured Beta Technologies COO Blain Newton, Fort Robotics Founder and CEO Samuel Reeves, and Kyslinger Consulting CEO Ron Kyslinger.""We see automation clearly as a future opportunity, but we think the [opportunity for] technology now is to create efficiencies in throughput and build capacity in the network,"" said Newton.Wall Street Journal logistics reporter Liz Young moderated a conversation about powering a sustainable future with Exelon President and COO Calvin Butler, AlphaStruxture, CEO Juan Macias and National Grid New York President Rudolph Wynter. The group talked about importance of ensuring equitable access to clean energy and how partnerships with utilities can help progress towards the clean energy future.""We have to make sure this energy transition is clean, fair and affordable…how do we make sure no communities get left behind in this transition?"" Wynter said. ""It's the end of 2022, and we're still talking about some people who don't have broadband access. We can't have the same thing happen on the energy transition.""Innovation was the theme of Bryan Walsh, editor of Vox's Future Perfect, discussion with Carl Haney, The Estee Lauder Companies EVP of Global Research &amp; Development, Innovation; Adam Grosser, Up.Partners Chairman and Managing Partner; and Lesley Slaton Brown, HP's Chief Diversity Officer. Consumers and the global workforce are the drivers behind a new era of innovation, they agreed, and companies are making significant investments to remain at the forefront.""Innovation requires diversity. That is looking at things from multiple angles. You have to be able to welcome all perspectives into the thought process, into the conversation,"" said Brown.World-renowned chef and founder of World Central Kitchen, José Andrés, and star of the Emmy-nominated documentary, ""We Feed People,"" wrapped up the event. Andrés in conversation with Tracy Ward, managing director of global marketing at Prologis, entertained and inspired the audience with stories of how his family and childhood set him on his path to change the world through food. The chef said innovative thinking and partnerships with local restaurants, farmers and community leaders play a huge role in the success of his work responding to major world disasters – and emphasized those same strategies can help strengthen the supply chain.He told the crowd that decision making is a key aspect of impactful leadership: ""The worst decision we ever make is the one we don't take,"" said Andres. ""When you are making a decision, you are moving. If you realize that that's not the perfect [decision] its' okay, because you're moving, you're able to change course and you can achieve whatever you want. If you don't make the decision, my friend, people will go hungry.""Hundreds gathered in-person, and thousands virtually, for the forum, which included additional LinkedIn Live half-time and post-show commentary.ABOUT PROLOGISPrologis, Inc. is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets.

Huawei is on the U.S. Commerce Department's entity list and banned from receiving U.S. exports and certain foreign-made items without government approval.Seagate was warned in a ""proposed charging letter"" it received from the Commerce Department on Aug. 29, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The filing said the company's position is that the hard disk drives are not subject to the U.S. export regulations, and that it did not engage in prohibited conduct as alleged by the Commerce Department.Seagate's filing did not identify the customer. Seagate paused its shipments to Huawei a year ago, said the source familiar with the matter.The Commerce Department declined comment on any potential pending enforcement matters but a spokesperson said the department is committed to ""fully investigating any allegation of violations"" of the rule restricting certain foreign-made items, adding that it ""aggressively pursues criminal and civil actions related to unauthorized exports to China.""A spokeswoman for Huawei had no immediate comment. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker was placed on the entity list in 2019 for activities deemed contrary to U.S. national security.Seagate, a Dublin-based company that also operates in California, said it was cooperating with the Commerce Department and sought to resolve the matter.The products at issue were provided to the entity listed customer and its affiliates between August 2020 and September 2021, according to the disclosure.Story continuesThe company said the timing of any final outcome is unclear, as are the terms. It also could not estimate the range of loss or penalty, although it said a material impact on the business was possible.The company could face civil penalties of up to $300,000 per violation or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, for administrative charges.The company hopes to make its case in an upcoming meeting with the Commerce Department, the source said. It sent an initial response to the letter in late September and filed more information this week.Seagate's shares were down 11 percent early Wednesday after the company reported financial results and disclosed the warning over the alleged export violations.At issue is a U.S. regulation that governs the way certain foreign-made items destined for Huawei become subject to U.S. export regulations.The Foreign Direct Product Rule, as revised in August 2020, restricts companies from shipping items made outside the United States to Huawei if they are the direct product of certain U.S. technology or software, or produced by essential equipment that is the direct product of U.S.-origin software or technology. Such shipments can only be made with a U.S. license.The rule was designed to cut the global supply of semiconductors to Huawei.Seagate's view is that its foreign-made hard drives are not subject to the restriction, the source told Reuters, because they are neither the direct product of any U.S. semiconductor technology or software nor of any equipment that itself is the direct product of any U.S. semiconductor technology or software.However, the source said, the Commerce Department’s proposed charges are based on an interpretation that foreign-made items are subject to the rule if equipment that is the direct product of U.S. semiconductor technology or software was used to produce any component of the end-item, no matter how far removed in the production process.The hard disk drives are made in China and Thailand and also do not have enough U.S. content to make them subject to U.S. export rules, the source said.The company has not applied for U.S. licenses for the hard disk drives but has applied for licenses for other items when it determined they were required, the source added.Republicans on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee issued a report last October that found that Seagate had likely shipped restricted products to Huawei for as long as a year, giving it a competitive advantage over Toshiba and Western Digital, the other primary suppliers of hard disk drives, who said they had ceased shipments to Huawei after the new rule took effect in 2020.Western Digital told Reuters in May 2021 it had stopped shipping to Huawei in September 2020 and applied for a license, which was pending. The company did not respond to requests for an update and comment.Toshiba also did not respond to requests for comment.(Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Chris Sanders and Howard Goller)]"

The charges are expected to be primarily cash-based and consist of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits.The Company expects to realize run-rate savings of approximately $110 million on an annualized basis starting in the fiscal third quarter 2023.Business OutlookThe business outlook for the fiscal second quarter 2023 is based on our current assumptions and expectations; actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this release.The Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal second quarter 2023:Revenue of $1.85 billion, plus or minus $150 millionNon-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.15, plus or minus $0.20Guidance regarding non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes known pre-tax charges related to amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.01 per share, estimated share-based compensation expenses of $0.18 per share, and restructuring costs of $0.29 to $0.34 per share.We have not reconciled our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal second quarter 2023 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, pandemic-related lockdown charges, losses and costs on the modification or redemption and repurchase of debt, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges, income tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal second quarter 2023 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.Investor CommunicationsSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET that can be accessed on its Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com.An archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate’s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com shortly following the event conclusion.About SeagateSeagate Technology crafts the datasphere, helping to maximize humanity’s potential by innovating world-class, precision-engineered data storage and management solutions with a focus on sustainable partnerships.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.These non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company’s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLCRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)(Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedSeptember 30, 2022October 1, 2021GAAP Gross Profit$482$956Amortization of acquired intangible assets11Share-based compensation89Pandemic-related lockdown charges7—Non-GAAP Gross Profit$498$966GAAP Gross Margin23.7%30.7%Non-GAAP Gross Margin24.5%31.0%GAAP Operating Expenses$375$370Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts(22)—Amortization of acquired intangible assets(3)(3)Restructuring and other, net(9)(1)Share-based compensation(21)(25)Other charges(6)(2)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses$314$339GAAP Income From Operations$107$586Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts22—Amortization of acquired intangible assets44Restructuring and other, net91Share-based compensation2934Pandemic-related lockdown charges7—Other charges62Non-GAAP Income From Operations$184$627GAAP Operating Margin5.3%18.8%Non-GAAP Operating Margin9.0%20.1%GAAP Net Income$29$526Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts22—Amortization of acquired intangible assets44Restructuring and other, net91Strategic investment gains or impairment charges—(9)Share-based compensation2934Pandemic-related lockdown charges7—Other charges62Income tax adjustments(5)(14)Non-GAAP Net Income$101$544Shares used in diluted net income per share calculation210231GAAP Diluted Net Income Per Share$0.14$2.28Non-GAAP Diluted Net Income Per Share$0.48$2.35GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities$245$496Acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements133117Free Cash Flow$112$379The Company’s Non-GAAP measures are adjusted for the following items:Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving effortsThese expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures due to the inconsistency in amount and frequency and are excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Amortization of acquired intangible assetsThe Company records expense from amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations over their estimated useful lives. Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Share-based compensationThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.Restructuring and other, netRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company’s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs. These also exclude charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Other chargesThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Pandemic-related lockdown chargesPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Losses and costs on the modification or redemption and repurchase of debtFrom time to time, the Company incurs losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments. The losses represent the difference between the reacquisition costs and the par value of the debt extinguished. Fees include certain costs associated with a debt modification or extinguishment, and the write-off of any unamortized debt issuance costs associated with an extinguishment of debt. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the repurchase of debt and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.Strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment chargesFrom time to time, the Company incurs losses, gains or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Income tax adjustmentsProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.Free cash flowFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities, and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221026005040/en/ContactsInvestor Relations Contact: Shanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600shanye.hudson@seagate.comMedia Contact: Gregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092gregory.belloni@seagate.com]"

This compares to earnings of $1.08 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.95%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this truck maker would post earnings of $1.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of 14.36%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Paccar , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, posted revenues of $6.69 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.74 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Paccar shares have added about 4.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for Paccar?While Paccar has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Paccar: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.10 on $6.99 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.77 on $26.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Domestic is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

401,b2787f62-07ed-343c-8e38-f9d317931c53,TROW,2022-10-26,Analysts Estimate Hamilton Lane (HLNE) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-hamilton-lane-hlne-140102411.html,1666706462,STORY,"['TROW', 'HLNE']","[Hamilton Lane (HLNE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis private-market investment firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -58%.Revenues are expected to be $102.51 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.88% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hamilton Lane?For Hamilton Lane, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hamilton Lane will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hamilton Lane would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hamilton Lane doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, T. Rowe Price (TROW) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -44%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.54 billion, down 21.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for T. Rowe has been revised 10.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that T. Rowe will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

UPS teams are aggressively pursuing new revenue and zeroing in on more profitable industries and services designed to lower UPS delivery costs and bolster customer service.Tomé, the first woman to lead UPS, said the 115-year-old company used to put volume ahead of value.Now, Tomé told Reuters, the company's plan is to ""lean in, and whatever comes our way, build enough agility into our operating plan that we can turn on a dime.""UPS shareholder Gary Bradshaw said Tomé had a successful track record as chief financial officer at Home Depot Inc.""She delivers,"" said Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, which holds about 20,000 UPS shares in different accounts. ""As a shareholder, you feel like you could count on her.""HEALTHCARE TO RETAILUPS was on the front lines of super-cold COVID-19 vaccine deliveries and this year's purchase of Italy's Bomi Group will expand its footprint in the specialized and highly competitive global healthcare logistics segment.Story continuesThe deal, valued at between $500 million and $1 billion, will bolster the company's position in Europe and Latin America. It will also accelerate growth in UPS's healthcare business which Tomé says is on track to top $10 billion in annual revenue by 2023 and could double that over the next several years.UPS has a built-in cost advantage over FedEx. That is because it runs a single, unified network versus its rivals' disparate systems, analysts say.UPS is embracing new technology to expand that lead and woo new business to shelter profit in a tougher operating environment.It is adding radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags used on premium healthcare shipments to everyday packages. That will help UPS workers avoid millions of package scans per day - freeing up employees for other tasks and reducing lost and misdirected packages.In a new project, UPS is using data to consolidate deliveries when a shopper has several orders from different retailers within a few hours. That could slash costs by cutting the number of trucks required to make those deliveries.Those and other digital initiatives are expected to help UPS win roughly $2 billion in new business this year from retailers and small businesses that sell via platforms like eBay and Shopify, Tomé said.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

The earnings beat was primarily owing to higher delivery prices. Favorable pricing more than offset the downside caused by declining shipping volumes. The bottom line increased 10.33% year over year.Quarterly revenues of $24,161 million, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24,319.8 million. The top line increased 4.2% year over year, driven by the uptick in revenue per piece shipped.Shipping volumes declined 2.1% year over year to 22.9 million. The decline in the volume of packages shipped indicates weakening demand due to the economic slowdown.Overall adjusted operating profit rose 8.6% year over year to $3,224 million in the third quarter, boosted by growth in the adjusted operating profit in the U.S. domestic package segment. In the first nine months of 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $8,472 million compared with $9,265 million in the first nine months of 2021. UPS’ capital expenditures were $2,278 million in the first nine months of 2022.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues increased 8.2% year over year to $15,374 million in the third quarter, driven by a 9.8% increase in revenue per piece. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) jumped 19.2% year over year to $1,686 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 11% in the September quarter. Average daily volume in the segment declined 1.5% year over year in the reported quarter.Revenues at the International Package division summed $4,799 million, up 1.7% year over year.

Consolidated average daily volume in the segment declined 5.2% year over year in the reported quarter. On the domestic front, average daily volume fell 9.4%. Average daily volume (export) was down 0.6%Story continuesSupply Chain and Freight revenues declined 6.3% to $3,988 million due to softness in the air and ocean freight forwarding operations. Operating profit (on an adjusted basis) inched up 0.9% to $459 million in the September quarter.2022 OutlookUPS, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), still expects consolidated revenues of about $102 billion, an adjusted operating margin of 13.7% and an adjusted return on invested capital to be above 30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is currently pegged at $101.67 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UPS expects capital expenditures to be around $5 billion.

Escalated operating expenses induced the earnings miss. Multiple flight cancelations and booking weaknesses due to Hurricane Ian also hurt results. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then.DAL reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million. Driven by high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis.United Airlines’ UAL third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. Upbeat air-travel demand aided results.In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.02 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimate of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to an uptick in air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.2% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. JBHT reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results, wherein both earnings and revenues outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressThe Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$147. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year American Express insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does American Express Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own about US$126m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of American Express insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing American Express.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -111.9%.Revenues are expected to be $81.4 million, up 15.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.41% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AtriCure?For AtriCure, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AtriCure will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that AtriCure would post a loss of $0.30 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.32, delivering a surprise of -6.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.AtriCure doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, ResMed (RMD) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $942.12 million, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for ResMed has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.57%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ResMed will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nordstrom (JWN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.15 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 22, 2022.Nordstrom's Earnings ESP sits at 11.48%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13.JWN is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tractor Supply (TSCO) as well.Slated to report earnings on January 26, 2023, Tractor Supply holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.35 a share 93 days from its next quarterly update.Tractor Supply's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.31% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.34.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, JWN and TSCO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

424,fc67199b-38d6-3f7c-89d9-dac91a2b7849,MDLZ,2022-10-26,Analysts Estimate Mondelez (MDLZ) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mondelez-mdlz-report-140102241.html,1666706462,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Mondelez (MDLZ) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.2%.Revenues are expected to be $7.46 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mondelez?For Mondelez, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mondelez will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mondelez would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +4.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mondelez doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, more than a decade after they were introduced, rates of forest destruction, poverty and child labour in cocoa remain high.The schemes have been much criticised for not committing to paying farmers a living income.Oreo cookie maker Mondelez said Cocoa Life will ""aim to increase the number of farming households reaching a living income, enhance child protection systems and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms globally'.

427,9a3e94d9-82c3-373d-adf7-ced7da516f1d,OXY,2022-10-26,Is Occidental Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:OXY) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporations-nyse-oxy-140149927.html,1666706509,STORY,['OXY'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE:OXY) stock increased significantly by 21% over the past month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:40% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.40 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 40% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Occidental Petroleum has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 26% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As you might expect, the 15% net income decline reported by Occidental Petroleum doesn't bode well with us. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesNext, when we compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 3.4% in the same period, we still found Occidental Petroleum's performance to be quite bleak, because the company has been shrinking its earnings faster than the industry.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for OXY? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Occidental Petroleum Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Occidental Petroleum's low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 2.6% (or a retention ratio of 97%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 11% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 18% over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Occidental Petroleum has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future.

428,6ba20552-f410-3605-8ba3-22f409f2bebe,OXY,2022-10-26,10 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-energy-stocks-buy-opec-123238871.html,1666701158,STORY,"['NG=F', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'GLNG', 'SRE', 'CRK', 'KOS', 'NEX', 'MRO', 'OXY', 'COP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten energy stocks to buy on the OPEC production cuts. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts.  The decision by OPEC+ to cut oil output earlier this month has become a source of friction between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as efforts by the U.S. government to lobby the latter to change its mind prior to the cut went unheeded. The decision, which according to Saudi officials is purely economic in nature, is instead alleged to be based on support for Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and a risk to the global economy as populations all around face record high inflation, caused by high commodity prices.These cuts will only reinforce the need to invest in alternative oil production sources, and given the rising global energy needs, oil will continue to play a crucial role. A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that global energy demand will grow by 47% by 2050, as more populations enter the middle class and improve their living conditions. Natural gas in particular will see rising demand, due to the fuel's clean burning properties, and this demand will cause natural gas consumption to grow by 31% by the end of the forecast period.The EIA focuses next on the U.S., to estimate that oil and gas will remain the dominant fuel sources in the country by 2050. The largest demand will come from the industrial sector, as hydrocarbon gas liquids remain crucial sources of feedstock. Over the coming winter, household energy expenditures will grow due to soaring costs and high expenditures, with the government agency estimating that homes using natural gas, heating oil, electricity, and propane will see their expenditures grow by 28%, 27%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. It also estimates that U.S. crude oil production will grow to 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023, to set a new record high.Commenting on the OPEC+ oil cut, the vice chairman of S&amp;P Global Mr. Dan Yergin explained that the decision is being viewed in Washington as being political in nature - particularly to harm President Joe Biden's campaign for the midterm elections. Mr. Yergin explained to CNBC that:Story continuesI think Hadley what you described, a couple of things are really key, what it's really about a million barrels a day and it doesn't go into effect till November. That's and I think, that basically, it's the R word - recession - that they've been focusing on, if you're listening to the U.S. central bank and others. However, as you point out the interpretation here in Washington is quite different, this is seen as a, first of all a blow against Biden who came to Saudi Arabia. Secondly, it's seen as somehow political, interfering in the U.S. election although the cut doesn't go into effect until November, and the third thing of course is the other R word, Russia, that this is seen as bolstering Russian revenues.Today's piece will take a look at some of the top energy stocks in the industry, with the notable picks being ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).Photo by Jeff W on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe took a broad look at the energy sector and its different constituents such as exploration, production, and transportation, to narrow down to the top 10 companies that are going to benefit from the current market environment. They were then analyzed through their financials and market performance, after which they were ranked through Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.10 Energy Stocks To Buy On OPEC Production Cuts10. Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) is an American oil company that was set up in 1919 and is responsible for exploring and producing oil and natural gas. The firm has millions of cubic feet of natural gas reserves and thousands of oil wells all over the United States.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) is a huge beneficiary of the soaring natural gas prices, which despite a drop earlier this month, are still up as much as 74% year to date due to the gas shortage in Europe in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company's cash flow jumped by 50% during its first quarter, which then allowed it to become debt-light as it saved $47 million in interest through early debt retirement. By the end of June 2022, Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s free cash flow stood at $190 million for a whopping 578% annual increase.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s shares have also rallied on the market, and year to date they are up by 94%. Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 25 had invested in the company.Out of these, D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw is Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s largest investor. It owns 41 million shares that are worth $49 million.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) joins our list of best energy stocks, with other strong companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).9. Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) is a deep water oil and gas exploration company. The firm is headquartered in Dallas Texas, the United States and it explores oil in the Gulf of Mexico and Ghana, among other regions.Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)'s oil production stood at 62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by the end of June 2022, and based on the current high demand for oil, the firm aimed to increase this to as much as 63,000 boepd by the end of September 2022 and to 67,000 boepd by the end of this year. Berenberg increased the company's share price target to $8.5 from $8.3 in August 2022, citing the firm's strong capabilities to leverage high gas prices.By the end of this year's second quarter, 25 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS).Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)’s largest investor is D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns 10 million shares that are worth $65 million.8. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG), as the name suggests, is a liquefied natural gas company. The firm builds and operates plants for the gasification and regasification of LNG. It owns and operates LNG carriers, floating LNG vessels, and floating regasification units.The aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made LNG king, and one of the beneficiaries will be Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). This is evident from the fact that natural gas charter rates jumped to a record high in October 2022, as the cost to charter a ship in the Atlantic rose to a whopping $397,500 per day. For comparison, the LNG charter rate in the Atlantic was a 'mere' $91,000 last year.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) also benefits from rising oil prices, as its gas liquefaction ship is under a contract that lets it earn $3.1 million each for a $1 price increase in Brent crude oil. Therefore, as the Saudi output cuts push prices higher, Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is in for a windfall.Insider Monkey's June 2022 quarter survey of 895 hedge funds saw 27 investors in the company.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)'s largest investor is William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns 10 million shares that are worth $249 million.Horos Asset Management mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable risk-return setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.”7. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is an energy services holding company that is headquartered in San Diego, California, the United States. The firm provides electricity and gas to tens of millions of Americans and it owns transmission facilities that provide more than 40,000 Megawatts of electricity.Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has signed three contracts this year through which it will meet Europe's intensive demand for LNG. These contracts will supply LNG to Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with the total shipped volume agreed to be 6.6 million metric tons. The company's revenue jumped by 30% during its second quarter, as it brought in $3.5 billion and its EPS guidance was also raised to $8.7 from an earlier $8.1.Sempra (NYSE:SRE) also pays a $1.15 dividend for a 3.22% yield and its shares have rallied by 7% year to date. Out of the 895 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's June quarter of 2022 survey, 29 had invested in the company.Israel Englander's Millennium Management is Sempra (NYSE:SRE)'s largest investor. It owns 819,727 shares that are worth $123 million. The fund increased its stake by a large 125% during Q2 2022.6. NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc.

It has amassed assets over $2.43 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap BlendMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.41%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 16.20% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) accounts for about 0.65% of total assets, followed by Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR) and Republic Services Inc (RSG).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.54% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJHMM seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index before fees and expenses. The John Hancock Dimensional Mid Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are between the 200th and 951st largest U.S. company.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -19.11% so far this year and is down about -17.88% in the last one year (as of 10/25/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.60 and $56.63.The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 27.21% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 665 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesJohn Hancock Multifactor Mid Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JHMM is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard MidCap ETF has $47.09 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF has $58.93 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.To calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) available to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share we exclude certain charges (credits), which include amortization expense, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio gains and losses, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits); and certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax at the company's effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-270-30, ""General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate."" Please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that we file thereafter for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item.The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) available to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) available to common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share - assuming dilution, respectively.To calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales on a GAAP basis.Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) available to common stockholders, adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational net sales growth rates and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results ""through the eyes"" of management.

In the last reported quarter, VRTX delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.45%.This large-cap biotech’s performance has been pretty impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters but missing the mark in one. VRTX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.52%, on average.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and ConsensusVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price-consensus-chart | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote In the year so far, shares of Vertex have risen 41.4% against the industry’s 26.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported.Factors to ConsiderVertex’s revenue growth in third-quarter 2022 is likely to have been driven by a rapid uptake of its newest cystic fibrosis (CF) medicine Trikafta/Kaftrio (Trikafta’s brand name in Europe). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trikafta sales is pegged at $1.93 billion.Sales for Trikafta in the United States are likely to have been driven by increased drug adoption among pediatric patients (6-11 years of age) in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued uptake of Kaftrio in Europe and a label expansionapproval for pediatric patients might have driven the product’s international revenues.Higher sales of Trikafta are likely to have caused sales erosion of Vertex’s other CF drugs and existing combinations, namely Kalydeco and Symdeko/Symkevi. We expect Orkambi sales to rise after the FDA approvedthe expanded use of the drug in children aged 12 months to less than 24 months in September 2022.Investors will also expect an update on Vertex’s non-CF pipeline during the third-quarter conference call.As part of its collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, Vertex is developing exa-cel (formerly CTX001), an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for two indications, namely sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT).Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Story continuesLast month, Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics announced that they had secured the FDA’s permission to initiate a rolling biologics license application (BLA) submission for exa-cel in both SCD and TDT indications. Based on discussions with regulatory authroities, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex will begin rolling review this November and intends to complete the same by the end of first-quarter 2023.This July, Vertex announced its plans to advance VX-548, its non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitorinto pivotal phase III development for acute pain. The study is expected to start by year-end.In July, Vertex also announced that the FDA lifted the clinical hold placed on the phase I/II study, evaluating its investigational stem cell-based therapy VX-880 for type I diabetes (T1D). To further accelerate the development of VX-880, Vertex announced plans to acquire ViaCyte, its collaboration partner for VX-880, for $320 million in cash.The deal is expected to be completed later this year, subject to certain customary closing conditions.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Vertex this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

In September, CRISPR and Vertex reported that the FDA granted exa-cel a rolling review for the potential treatment of SCD and TDT. Vertex will submit its biologics licensing application (BLA) for exa-cel for rolling review in November 2022. It expects to complete the submission by the end of first-quarter 2023.CRISPR Therapeutics has also been developing its wholly-owned immuno-oncology pipeline, which currently consists of three chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy candidates, namely CTX110, CTX120 and CTX130, for the treatment of hematological and solid-tumor cancers.Story continuesCRSP is currently evaluating CTX110 in the phase I CARBON study to treat relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Additional data from this study are expected later this year.The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of CTX120 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase I study to treat relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.CTX130 is being evaluated in two ongoing independent early-stage studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of several dose levels of the candidate in adults with solid tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (COBALT-RCC study) and certain T-cell and B-cell hematologic malignancies (COBALT-LYM study).In June 2022, management announced preliminary results from the COBALT-LYM study, which demonstrated that treatment with CTX130 produced broad activity and deep responses in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphomas, especially at higher dose levels.CRISPR is also advancing several next-generation CAR-T product candidates, namely — 112 targeting CD19 antigen and CTX131 targeting CD70 antigen. These candidates have been designed to enhance CAR-T potency.Activities related to the development of pipeline candidates are likely to have escalated operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CRISPR Therapeutics this time around.

435,ee6605df-b66e-3c69-be9a-e1c26c6bd1b5,VRTX,2022-10-26,Earnings Preview: Ultragenyx (RARE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-ultragenyx-rare-q3-140102630.html,1666706462,STORY,"['RARE', 'VRTX']","[Ultragenyx (RARE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biotechnology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $2.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -101.9%.Revenues are expected to be $98.76 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ultragenyx?For Ultragenyx, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ultragenyx will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ultragenyx would post a loss of $1.72 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.26, delivering a surprise of -31.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ultragenyx doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.68 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.22 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Vertex has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.52%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Vertex will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.95%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.85 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.CN shares have lost about 7.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -20.3%.What's Next for CN?While CN has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CN: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

We have the S&amp;P 500 up over 1%. I believe this is going to make three days in a row. I was doing a little study earlier today. And that portends some strength. However, if you bought those two signals earlier in the year, would not have worked out three, six months down the line. However, historically going back, there is something to this. So I'll get into that towards the close of the bell.Just wanted to point everybody's attention to the Yahoo Finance trending tickers. And Seana, you were taking a look at the meme stocks and also some of the other fringe elements to the stock universe. I want to go over some earnings and do it democratically. But I got to scroll down for General Motors here. People focused on a lot of things here today. So first of all, the stock's up about 3% or 4% here. And I want to focus on some of the analysts' commentary.RBC, which rates at an outperform, saying, after the Ford preannouncement-- that was a negative-- and some GM volume data, some investors were concerned about a miss. 2022 guidance reaffirmed, but this leaves a pretty wide range for implied fourth quarter levels. Midpoint of the implied fourth quarter EPS below the Street, but full year Street view is closer to the low end of 6.75 versus 6.50 to 7.50. Would not be surprised to see fourth quarter numbers creep a little higher.Let me just take a quick look at the stock here. You can see that's today's performance. Here is a year to date.

MHK is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% but declined 0.9% year over year. Net sales lagged the consensus estimate by 1.4% but increased 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.MHK’s earnings surpassed expectations in all the trailing four quarters, with the average being 8.5%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mohawk’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.34 per share, indicating a 15.4% decline from the prior-year reported figure of $3.95. The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $3.06 billion, suggesting an 8.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $2.82 billion.Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Mohawk Industries, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMohawk Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mohawk Industries, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteMohawk’s sales in third-quarter 2022 are expected to have slowed down owing to softness in the housing industry and remodeling activities. Higher interest rates and inflationary pressure have been moderating demand for homes, impacting consumer discretionary spending. Also, residential remodeling is softening as consumers have been deferring their home improvement projects.In Europe, dramatically variable natural gas prices and constrained supply are reducing economic growth. Mohawk has been witnessing inflation in most product categories. Also, the availability of material, labor and transportation has been challenging, thereby inflating costs. Especially, tight chemical supplies are hurting the output of LVT, carpet, laminate and board panels. These inflationary pressures are likely to weigh on third-quarter bottom-line results.MHK expects third-quarter adjusted earnings (excluding restructuring charges) in the range of $3.33-$3.43 per share.The consensus mark for revenues from the Global Ceramic unit is pegged at $1,089 million, implying a 9.1% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for the Flooring NA segment’s net sales is pegged at $1,140 million, indicating an increase of 8.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues from Flooring ROW is pegged at $816 million, suggesting a 6.3% improvement from the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW businesses’ adjusted operating income suggests a decline of 10.9%, 10% and 27.1%, respectively, from a year ago period.That said, Mohawk has undertaken certain actions across the enterprise to reduce costs. In Flooring NA, it has rationalized some older, less efficient fiber assets and reduced rug manufacturing capacity. In Flooring ROW, it is consolidating insulation products and streamlining organization. In Ceramic Europe, it is simplifying the administrative and manufacturing organizations. These actions are likely to have benefited the company in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mohawk this time around.

448,7b9e57df-c39b-3055-8536-3f11c44c7085,INCY,2022-10-26,Earnings Preview: Incyte (INCY) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-incyte-incy-q3-140102182.html,1666706462,STORY,['INCY'],"[Incyte (INCY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.3%.Revenues are expected to be $856.86 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Incyte?For Incyte, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.65%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Incyte will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Incyte would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of +27.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Incyte doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

449,d333fc7b-08fa-30e5-af8a-bd0264d835ab,INCY,2022-10-26,A Bear Market Rally or Markets Forming a Solid Base: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-market-rally-markets-forming-115211303.html,1666698731,STORY,"['COMP', 'IBKR', '^GSPC', 'WMB', 'INCY', 'LW', 'HUBB']","[Wall Street is witnessing a good rally in October after a horrible September. Historically, several major stock market crashes happened this month. However, this year, it looks like October will see a happy ending.Month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — have advanced 9.7%, 5.9% and 3.6%. On the other hand, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have plummeted 13.3%, 20.3% and 30%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are in bear market territory. That is why, financial experts have characterized the ongoing October rally as a bear market rally or a relief rally, similar to the one we saw from mid-June to mid-August.Although market participants are yet to be convinced about bottoming out, October’s rally has some positives. Let’s discuss briefly.Are Markets Trying to Form a Base?U.S. stock markets have seen extreme intraday fluctuations in the past one month. The Dow has recorded around 600-700 points of intraday swing and the Nasdaq Composite has seen 300-400 points of intraday swing. The S&amp;P 500 has registered 50-60 points of intraday swing in the past month. If we consider, pre-market movements of index futures, intraday fluctuations of these three indexes will be much wider.This clearly shows that investors are unleashing both “Sale on the Rise” and “Buy on the Dip” strategies to strengthen their portfolios. Since the market is uncertain about the future movement of the interest rate and Fed’s tightening, investors are taking a short-term view and selling stocks to book quick profits. At the same time, markets are no longer showing a secular downtrend. This means that some sort of sentiments is growing among investors regarding bottoming out.When such a situation arises, the market seems to form a base on which it can ride for the long term growth trajectory. In U.S. stock markets, this type of scenario has been visible in the past month. From here the market can witness a steep rise if a minimum positive clue comes from the Fed. Story continuesOther PositivesLast week, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Fed officials are skeptical about the continuation of the central bank’s aggressive rate hike and tighter monetary control. The officials have already started to express their desire to slow down the pace of rate hikes soon and to stop raising rates altogether early next year. They want to reduce the risk of a hard landing of the economy caused by the policy interventions of the Fed.The Fed has already hiked the benchmark lending rate by 3% in 2022. The cumulative effect of a higher interest rate regime takes time to be visible in the economy. A section of market participants led by Ark Investment Management believes that the central bank should not take decisions about the future course of interest rate movement based on lag indicators like nonfarm payrolls and inflation rates.Instead, the Fed should take a decision on lead indicators like declining commodity prices (except food and energy), growing accumulation of inventories on the part of manufacturers and retailers, gradual slowdown of the ISM manufacturing PMI and a decline in the job openings rate. All these lead indicators point to the cooling down of the U.S. economy.Stock Selection ProcessAn upward EPS estimate revision for any stock for the rest of 2022 simply means that the market is expecting the company to do good business this year. A positive estimate revision within the last 30 days means that the market is thinking positively about the company.Therefore, a positive EPS estimate revision under growing threats of inflation highlights the solid business model and robust growth potential of a company. Investors can certainly take a look at these stocks that currently have strong earnings momentum.We have narrowed our search to five such large-cap U.S. companies with strong potential for the rest of 2022. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three molnths.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Williams Companies Inc. WMB operates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States. With U.S. natural gas demand projected to grow significantly in the long term, WMB seems well positioned to capitalize on the same owing to its impressive portfolio of large-scale value-creating projects.In particular, the company's existing and expansionary development projects associated with the massive Transco gas transmission system are expected to boost Williams’ growth prospects. WMB’s thriving deepwater transportation business is another positive.The Williams Companies has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the last seven days.Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. IBKR specializes in executing and clearing trades in securities, futures, foreign exchange instruments, bonds, and mutual funds.Interactive Brokers Group’s efforts to develop proprietary software (including IBKR Lite), its low level of compensation expenses relative to net revenues and an increase in emerging market customers will likely continue aiding its financials. The acquisition of the retail unit of Folio Investments will strengthen IBKR’s position in the online brokerage space.Interactive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.8% over the last seven days.Incyte Corp. INCY focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of various therapeutics in the United States. lINCY’s ead drug, Jakafi, higher royalty revenues and encouraging uptake of other recently approved drugs maintain momentum for the company. Jakafi’s label expansion in additional indications is anticipated to further drive sales, and the company has raised the bottom end of full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance.The recent FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream under the brand name Opzelura has diversified the portfolio of Incyte. The uptake of Pemazyre and other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Tabrecta is a positive and should boost sales. The label expansion of these drugs is also positive and will generate incremental sales.Incyte has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.Hubbell Inc. HUBB is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets. HUBB’s products include plugs, receptacles, connectors, lighting fixtures, high voltage test and measurement equipment and voice and data signal processing components. Hubbell operates through two segments — Electrical Solution and Utility Solution.HUBB has an expected earnings growth rate of 23.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 1% over the last seven days.Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. LW produces, distributes, and markets value-added frozen potato products worldwide. LW’s top line has been benefiting from robust price/mix, as witnessed during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The price/mix increased 19%, reflecting gains from pricing actions in the core business segments to counter input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation.Lamb Weston’s top and bottom lines increased year over year in the quarter. LW saw net sales growth across all three reporting segments. While the macro environment remains volatile, management is on track to deliver results at the high end of the sales and earnings target in fiscal 2023. In addition, Lamb Weston has been keen on boosting production capacity to fuel long-term growth.Lamb Weston has an expected earnings growth rate of 45.7% for the current year (ending May 2023).

Quarterly adjusted earnings and net sales for the quarter, however, decreased 22.6% and 5.4%, respectively.Weyerhaeuser’s earnings beat the consensus mark in all the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 7%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has decreased to 41 cents from 43 cents per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 31.7% from the year-ago level. The consensus mark for revenues is $2.27 billion, suggesting a 3.3% year-over-year decline.Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company price-eps-surprise | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteFactors to NoteLast month, Weyerhaeuser revised third-quarter 2022 operating guidance, considering the recent impact of September work stoppages in its Oregon and Washington operations, stemming from ongoing union negotiations.Now, the company expects earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products to be approximately $40 million lower than the second quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of sales realizations for lumber &amp; oriented strand board (OSB), driven by labor and transportation constraints as well as the work stoppage in Washington and Oregon. Earlier, WY had expected Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to second-quarter 2022.WY now expects Timberlands earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the year-ago period, driven mainly by the work stoppage. It previously expected Timberlands adjusted EBITDA to sequentially lower but ""moderately higher"" from the year-ago period.Meanwhile, WY has kept the guidance for its Real Estate, Energy &amp; Natural Resources businesses unchanged. Weyerhaeuser’s earnings and adjusted EBITDA ares expected to be marginally lower than the year-ago period.Overall, lower lumber and OSB prices are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s third-quarter 2022 performance despite operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves of the company.Meanwhile, transportation and resin shortages have been a headwind for the Wood business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer may have also been a pressing concern.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wood Products segment (contributing approximately 78% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $1,797 million, implying a decrease from $1,853 million in the year-ago period and $2,341 million in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Timberland segment (contributing approximately 26% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $485 million, implying a decrease from $541 million in the year-ago period and $671 million in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment revenues is pegged at $67 million, implying a decline from $69 million a year ago and from $117 million in the prior quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Weyerhaeuser this time around.

The measure improved 70 basis points in the collection and disposal business as pricing and operating efficiencies worked to overcome inflationary cost pressures. This improvement was largely offset by the impacts of a sharp decline in market prices for recycled commodities.SG&amp;A expenses were 9.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 10.1% in the third quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, SG&amp;A expenses were 9.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 9.7% in the third quarter of 2021.(a)ProfitabilityOperating EBITDA in the Company’s collection and disposal business, adjusted on the same basis as total Company operating EBITDA, increased by approximately $174 million to $1.59 billion for the third quarter of 2022. Operating EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the Company’s collection and disposal business was 31.8% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 31.2% for the third quarter of 2021.(f)Operating EBITDA in the Company’s recycling line of business decreased by $36 million compared to the third quarter of 2021 primarily driven by a 32% decline in recycled commodity prices and persistent inflationary cost pressures on operating costs.Operating EBITDA in the Company’s renewable energy business was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results were generally in line with expectations as the Company sold about 30% of its renewable natural gas (RNG) under long-term contracts, which moderated the average price per MMBtu.Free Cash Flow &amp; Capital AllocationIn the third quarter of 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, in line with the third quarter of 2021.In the third quarter of 2022, capital expenditures to support the business were $547 million compared to $448 million in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, capital expenditures for sustainability growth investments were $210 million compared to $16 million in the third quarter of 2021.In the third quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $432 million compared to $773 million in the third quarter of 2021.(a) Free cash flow without sustainability growth investments was $642 million compared to $789 million in the third quarter of 2021.(a) The year-over-year decline in free cash flow was primarily driven by the planned increase in sustainability growth investments and accelerated capital spending to support the business.During the third quarter of 2022, $808 million was returned to shareholders, including $541 million allocated to share repurchases and $267 million of cash dividends.SUSTAINABILITY UPDATEThe Company released its 2022 Sustainability Report earlier this month, providing details on its Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) performance and outlining new 2030 priorities. The Sustainability Report conveys the strong linkage between the Company’s ESG goals and its growth strategy, inclusive of the planned expansion of the Company’s recycling and renewable energy businesses.The Company continues to progress its $1.625 billion sustainability growth investment program and remains on track to invest $550 million in 2022. These growth investments are intended to further WM’s sustainability leadership by increasing recycling volumes and growing RNG generation. Two of the 17 new RNG projects and five new or automated material recovery facilities (MRFs) are expected to be complete in 2022.

You should view these statements with caution. They are based on the facts and circumstances known to the Company as of the date the statements are made. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those set forth in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to failure to implement our optimization, growth, and cost savings initiatives and overall business strategy; failure to identify acquisition targets, consummate and integrate acquisitions; failure to obtain the results anticipated from acquisitions; environmental and other regulations, including developments related to emerging contaminants, gas emissions and renewable fuel; significant environmental, safety or other incidents resulting in liabilities or brand damage; failure to obtain and maintain necessary permits; failure to attract, hire and retain key team members and a high quality workforce; changes in wage and labor related regulations; significant storms and destructive climate events; public health risk and other impacts of COVID-19 or similar pandemic conditions, including related regulations, resulting in increased costs and social, labor and commercial disruption; macroeconomic pressures and market disruption resulting in labor, supply chain and transportation constraints and inflationary cost pressure; increased competition; pricing actions; commodity price fluctuations; impacts from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical conflict and international response, including increased risk of cyber incidents and exacerbation of market disruption, inflationary cost pressure and changes in commodity prices, fuel and other energy costs; international trade restrictions; disposal alternatives, waste diversion and diminishing disposal capacity; declining waste volumes; weakness in general economic conditions and capital markets; adoption of new tax legislation; fuel shortages; failure to develop and protect new technology; failure of technology to perform as expected, including implementation of a new enterprise resource planning and human capital management system; failure to prevent, detect and address cybersecurity incidents or comply with privacy regulations; negative outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings; and decisions or developments that result in impairment charges. Please also see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to its business. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, including financial estimates and forecasts, whether as a result of future events, circumstances or developments or otherwise.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTo supplement its financial information, the Company has presented, and/or may discuss on the conference call, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations, adjusted operating EBITDA, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses and free cash flow. All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.The Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace ""Net cash provided by operating activities,"" which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In Millions,

453,c561edf9-1a67-3a12-82fc-70d69fb2592d,INTU,2022-10-26,Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) five-year earnings growth trails the 23% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuits-nasdaq-intu-five-earnings-130017494.html,1666702817,STORY,['INTU'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock is up an impressive 176% over the last five years. We note the stock price is up 3.5% in the last seven days.Since it's been a strong week for Intuit shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Intuit While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Intuit managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 57.00.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Intuit's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Intuit the TSR over the last 5 years was 186%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 23% in the twelve months, Intuit shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 23%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

In today's Research Daily, we provide the updated Q3 earnings season scorecard, in addition to featuring new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Danaher Corporation (DHR), Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of this morning's results, we now have Q3 results from 129 S&amp;P 500 members or 25.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -0.5% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 73.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.3% beating revenue estimates. The Q3 earnings and revenue growth pace and the EPS beats percentage for this group of 129 index members is better than what we saw from this group in the preceding period. The revenue beats percentage for this group of 129 index members at 64.3% is modestly below the 66.7% for this group in 2022 Q2, but otherwise well within the historical range. This is a reassuring showing on the corporate earnings front that runs counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff that will result in companies overwhelmingly guiding lower. We have seen some of those. But for the most part, management teams have either guided higher, reaffirmed previous outlook or provided favorable qualitative commentary. A case in point is this mornig's UPS report whose reaffirmed guidance ran counter to what we had heard from FedEx a few weeks back. While 3M guided lower, Coke and GM provided favorable commentary. With respect to the coming periods, expectations are getting reset lower, as we have consistently been pointing out all along. S&amp;P 500 earnings for the last quarter of the year (2022 Q4) are currently expected to be up only +0.1% from the same period last year, which is down from +1.1% on October 19th and +2.5% on August 31st. Excluding contribution from the Energy sector, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index are currently expected to be down -4% from the year-earlier period, which is down from -3.6% on October 19th and -1.9% on August 31st. Story continuesFull year 2023 expectations are similarly coming down. For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Preview article &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's What to Expect from Big Tech Earnings Today's Featured Research ReportsShares of Danaher have declined -17.7% over the past year against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry’s decline of -25.4%. High raw material costs, and component shortages, due to supply chain issues, are weighing on the company’s operations. Coronavirus-induced headwinds in China add to its woes. Adverse foreign currency movements are affecting Danaher’s top line.However, strong segmental performances are driving Danaher’s growth. Robust activity in bioprocessing and strength in instrument business are boosting the Life Sciences unit’s performance. Robust growth in Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics is acting as a catalyst to the Diagnostics segment’s growth. Inorganic activities are contributing to the company’s top line growth. Danaher’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Danaher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Comcast shares have declined -42.5% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -47.0%. The company is persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.Though Comcast is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base. Slowing broadband user base addition primarily due to reversal of pandemic trends and increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber are concerns.Nevertheless, Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors. Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Starbucks shares have underperformed against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-26.1% vs. -13.5%). The company’s performance continues to be negatively impacted by dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market. The company believes that performance will be under massive pressure for the rest of the year.However, Starbucks has been benefiting from operating fundamentals such as a solid global footprint, successful innovations and digital offerings. North America comps continue to impress investors.For fiscal 2023 to 2025, Starbucks anticipates global and U.S. comparable store sales growth between 7% and 9% year over year. For fiscal 2023 to 2025, it expects its global store portfolio to increase approximately 7% annually, up from the prior estimate of 6%.(You can read the full research report on Starbucks here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.

VRSN is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, after the closing bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, suggesting an increase of 12.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $357 million, indicating an increase of 6.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVeriSign, Inc. price-eps-surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteVeriSign’s third-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from continued healthy growth across .com and .net domain name registrations. The company is expected to have gained from growing Internet consumption globally.VeriSign ended second-quarter 2022 with 174.3 million .com and .net domain name registrations, up 2.2% year over year.Per VeriSign, domain name registrations increased 10.4 million or 3% year over year to 351.5 million across all top-level domains at the end of second-quarter 2022. Domain name registrations increased 1 million or 0.3% sequentially.The growth is likely to be affected due to higher domain name registrations witnessed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, which has slowed down in 2022. Also, further weakness in registration from China may have acted as headwinds.Escalating operating expenses related to cybersecurity and infrastructure spending are likely to have weighed on the company’s third-quarter operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Also, ongoing uncertainty prevailing over the global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical instability in Europe remains a concern.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for VeriSign this time around.

456,7ac5b3a5-6a40-3db9-9ffe-75a98fc69246,WHR,2022-10-26,Bear of the Day: Whirlpool Corp. (WHR),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-whirlpool-corp-whr-100010419.html,1666778410,STORY,['WHR'],"[Whirlpool Corporation WHR manufactures and markets home appliances and related products globally. The company’s principal products include refrigerators, freezers, ice makers, water filters, laundry appliances, and dishwasher appliances. WHR distributes its products under well-known brands such as Maytag, KitchenAid, Whirlpool, Everydrop, and Royalstar brands. The company sells its products to retailers, distributors, dealers, builders, and directly to consumers.The Zacks RundownWHR has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, WHR experienced a climax top in May of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The stock is hitting a series of 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market continues its volatile start to the year.Whirlpool is part of the Zacks Household Appliances industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 9% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The industry has fallen nearly 49% this year, widely underperforming the market:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. Also note the unfavorable characteristics for this group below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWeak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for WHR lately. The household appliances company most recently reported Q3 earnings results last week of $4.49/share, a -19.68% miss versus the $5.59 consensus estimate. Revenues of $4.78 billion also missed the mark by -8.62%, and WHR has missed on revenue projections for the last five quarters. Consistently missing expectations by a wide margin is a recipe for stock price underperformance.Story continuesAnalysts have revised Q4 earnings estimates down by -8.81% in the past week. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $5.38/share, reflecting negative growth of -12.38% relative to the same quarter last year. Revenues are seen slipping -6.98% to $5.41 billion. These are the types of negative trends that the bears like to see.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical OutlookWHR stock has been steadily falling since last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping down. Shares have declined nearly 40% in the past year, and the stock continues to trade below both moving averages.StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsWhile not the most accurate indicator, WHR has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. WHR would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock is making a series of lower lows – another good sign for the bears.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock doesn’t deserve a spot in the household portfolio. The fact that WHR is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. Falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.WHR is rated a ‘C’ in our Zacks Style Score Growth category, indicating more weakness ahead. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

460,6ba20552-f410-3605-8ba3-22f409f2bebe,SRE,2022-10-26,10 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-energy-stocks-buy-opec-123238871.html,1666701158,STORY,"['NG=F', 'HO=F', 'CL=F', 'GLNG', 'SRE', 'CRK', 'KOS', 'NEX', 'MRO', 'OXY', 'COP']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten energy stocks to buy on the OPEC production cuts. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Energy Stocks To Buy On the OPEC Production Cuts.  The decision by OPEC+ to cut oil output earlier this month has become a source of friction between the United States and Saudi Arabia, as efforts by the U.S. government to lobby the latter to change its mind prior to the cut went unheeded. The decision, which according to Saudi officials is purely economic in nature, is instead alleged to be based on support for Russia for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and a risk to the global economy as populations all around face record high inflation, caused by high commodity prices.These cuts will only reinforce the need to invest in alternative oil production sources, and given the rising global energy needs, oil will continue to play a crucial role. A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that global energy demand will grow by 47% by 2050, as more populations enter the middle class and improve their living conditions. Natural gas in particular will see rising demand, due to the fuel's clean burning properties, and this demand will cause natural gas consumption to grow by 31% by the end of the forecast period.The EIA focuses next on the U.S., to estimate that oil and gas will remain the dominant fuel sources in the country by 2050. The largest demand will come from the industrial sector, as hydrocarbon gas liquids remain crucial sources of feedstock. Over the coming winter, household energy expenditures will grow due to soaring costs and high expenditures, with the government agency estimating that homes using natural gas, heating oil, electricity, and propane will see their expenditures grow by 28%, 27%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. It also estimates that U.S. crude oil production will grow to 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023, to set a new record high.Commenting on the OPEC+ oil cut, the vice chairman of S&amp;P Global Mr. Dan Yergin explained that the decision is being viewed in Washington as being political in nature - particularly to harm President Joe Biden's campaign for the midterm elections. Mr. Yergin explained to CNBC that:Story continuesI think Hadley what you described, a couple of things are really key, what it's really about a million barrels a day and it doesn't go into effect till November. That's and I think, that basically, it's the R word - recession - that they've been focusing on, if you're listening to the U.S. central bank and others. However, as you point out the interpretation here in Washington is quite different, this is seen as a, first of all a blow against Biden who came to Saudi Arabia. Secondly, it's seen as somehow political, interfering in the U.S. election although the cut doesn't go into effect until November, and the third thing of course is the other R word, Russia, that this is seen as bolstering Russian revenues.Today's piece will take a look at some of the top energy stocks in the industry, with the notable picks being ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).Photo by Jeff W on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe took a broad look at the energy sector and its different constituents such as exploration, production, and transportation, to narrow down to the top 10 companies that are going to benefit from the current market environment. They were then analyzed through their financials and market performance, after which they were ranked through Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.10 Energy Stocks To Buy On OPEC Production Cuts10. Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) is an American oil company that was set up in 1919 and is responsible for exploring and producing oil and natural gas. The firm has millions of cubic feet of natural gas reserves and thousands of oil wells all over the United States.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) is a huge beneficiary of the soaring natural gas prices, which despite a drop earlier this month, are still up as much as 74% year to date due to the gas shortage in Europe in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company's cash flow jumped by 50% during its first quarter, which then allowed it to become debt-light as it saved $47 million in interest through early debt retirement. By the end of June 2022, Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s free cash flow stood at $190 million for a whopping 578% annual increase.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s shares have also rallied on the market, and year to date they are up by 94%. Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds outlined that 25 had invested in the company.Out of these, D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw is Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK)'s largest investor. It owns 41 million shares that are worth $49 million.Comstock Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CRK) joins our list of best energy stocks, with other strong companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).9. Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) is a deep water oil and gas exploration company. The firm is headquartered in Dallas Texas, the United States and it explores oil in the Gulf of Mexico and Ghana, among other regions.Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)'s oil production stood at 62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by the end of June 2022, and based on the current high demand for oil, the firm aimed to increase this to as much as 63,000 boepd by the end of September 2022 and to 67,000 boepd by the end of this year. Berenberg increased the company's share price target to $8.5 from $8.3 in August 2022, citing the firm's strong capabilities to leverage high gas prices.By the end of this year's second quarter, 25 out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS).Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)’s largest investor is D.E. Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns 10 million shares that are worth $65 million.8. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG), as the name suggests, is a liquefied natural gas company. The firm builds and operates plants for the gasification and regasification of LNG. It owns and operates LNG carriers, floating LNG vessels, and floating regasification units.The aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made LNG king, and one of the beneficiaries will be Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). This is evident from the fact that natural gas charter rates jumped to a record high in October 2022, as the cost to charter a ship in the Atlantic rose to a whopping $397,500 per day. For comparison, the LNG charter rate in the Atlantic was a 'mere' $91,000 last year.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) also benefits from rising oil prices, as its gas liquefaction ship is under a contract that lets it earn $3.1 million each for a $1 price increase in Brent crude oil. Therefore, as the Saudi output cuts push prices higher, Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is in for a windfall.Insider Monkey's June 2022 quarter survey of 895 hedge funds saw 27 investors in the company.Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)'s largest investor is William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns 10 million shares that are worth $249 million.Horos Asset Management mentioned the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable risk-return setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.”7. Sempra (NYSE:SRE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is an energy services holding company that is headquartered in San Diego, California, the United States. The firm provides electricity and gas to tens of millions of Americans and it owns transmission facilities that provide more than 40,000 Megawatts of electricity.Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has signed three contracts this year through which it will meet Europe's intensive demand for LNG. These contracts will supply LNG to Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with the total shipped volume agreed to be 6.6 million metric tons.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty chemicals company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21%.Revenues are expected to be $2.93 billion, up 17.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Univar?For Univar, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Univar will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Univar would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Univar doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, LyondellBasell (LYB), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.96 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -43.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $13.28 billion, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for LyondellBasell has been revised 18.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.04%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LyondellBasell will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Progressive's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEWhen you first look at it, Progressive's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. Although, we can see that Progressive saw a modest net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is PGR worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PGR is currently mispriced by the market.Is Progressive Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 50% (or a retention ratio of 50%) for Progressive suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Progressive has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 23% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Progressive's performance. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty respectable, the low profit retention could mean that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been paying reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. An improvement in its ROE could also help future earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at 96 cents and $3.21 billion, respectively.For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for LKQ’s earnings per share has moved down by 1 cent in the past 30 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 5.9% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues also suggests a year-over-year decrease of 2.6%. Over the trailing four quarters, LKQ surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions, with the average surprise being 12.09%. This is depicted in the graph below:LKQ Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLKQ Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLKQ Corporation price-eps-surprise | LKQ Corporation QuoteQ2 HighlightsIn second-quarter 2022, LKQ’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 surpassed the consensus metric of $1.02, thanks to higher-than-expected revenues from the Wholesale North American segment. However, the bottom line fell 3.5% year over year. The company reported net sales of $3,341 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,389 million. In addition, the top line fell 2.1% from the year-ago level.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for the automotive replacement parts supplier for the quarter to be reported, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: LKQ has an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 1 cent higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors at PlayThe automobile replacement market is less susceptible to business upheavals as owners continue to spend on repair services and replacement parts for maintenance. The ongoing microchip deficit has caused an auto parts shortage that has affected new production. The supply bottleneck likely led consumers to continue using their existing vehicles, consequently increasing the demand for replacement parts and the average age of vehicles. LKQ’s performance for the to-be-reported quarter is expected to have gained from the robust demand for its products driven by the increasing longevity of vehicles.Story continuesAlso, strategic acquisitions, including Bumblebee batteries in the United States, a workshop concept in the Netherlands, two very small former automotive branch locations in Germany, and the equity interest of its former JV partner in a small aftermarket parts business in Germany are likely to have aided third-quarter 2022 performance. However, increased expenses for the ocean and land freight and rising operational and commodity costs might have limited margins.Here's a sneak peek at the firm’s key revenue projections for the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in Europe, which has the highest contribution to the company’s revenues, is pegged at $1,403 million, suggesting a decline from $1,520 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues from parts and services in North America unit for the third quarter is pegged at $1,008 million, indicating a fall from $1,077 million recorded in the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in the Specialty segment is $493 million, implying a rise from $465 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationLet’s take a look at some other players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Oshkosh OSK will release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Estée Lauder Companies' (NYSE:EL) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Estée Lauder Companies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$21b - US$5.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Estée Lauder Companies has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Personal Products industry average of 17%. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Estée Lauder Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Estée Lauder Companies' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 73% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If Estée Lauder Companies can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.The Key TakeawayEstée Lauder Companies has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesEstée Lauder Companies does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Estée Lauder Companies  that you might be interested in.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

EL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $155 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for The Estee Lauder Companies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Cosmetics industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.33 per share to $1.29 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about The Estee Lauder Companies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

This year with Halloween on a Monday, we’ll be feeling more than the Sunday Scaries – 4pm will truly be the ‘Witching Hour’ with even more to prep for!"" said Shawn Johnson. ""Thankfully, I’ll be ahead of the game with must-dos already checked off my list, including having Crest on hand to make sure my whole family’s smiles are covered so they can enjoy all the fun – and candy – that comes with the festivities.""Shawn Johnson’s Top Tips for Brushing off the Halloween Eve Sunday Scaries:Beat the Costume Chaos: If your kids are anything like mine, you’ve probably spent hours and hours figuring out their can’t-live-without costume, only to have them decide they don’t like it last minute. Not anymore! I’ve learned to lay out costumes the night before to eliminate any surprises and build up excitement for the following day.Protect Your Teeth From Creepy Cavities: My best trick for enjoying treats without fear of creepy cavities? Make teeth brushing a fun Halloween Eve activity! It may sound silly, but we’ll turn on Halloween tunes, dance around in the bathroom as a family and brush the scaries away. Halloween prep is hectic, but knowing that Crest toothpaste has my whole family covered means I can smile a little brighter on the spookiest night of the year. My personal favorite toothpaste is new Crest Densify, which helps extend the life of my teeth so I can keep smiling for many Halloweens to come.Map Out Your Trick-Or-Treating Plan: Let’s be real, everyone knows that one house on the block that gives out the full-size candy bars. Maybe you visit that house first, or maybe you’d rather skip the long line of treat-hungry trick-or-treaters – either way, plan out your route the night before, and coordinate with other families to make the night-of a breeze. It will also be important to decide ahead of time who will be staying behind at the house to distribute candy, and who will be taking the kids out – we take turns at our house!Prepare the Candy Cauldron: It may seem small, but being able to check off as many to-dos as possible on Halloween Eve allows me be as present as possible for my family on Halloween night. I always fill the treat bowl the night before and set it by the door with extra candy bags on hand for easy refills.Make Night-Before Prep a Game: The Johnson Easts do not mess around when it comes to Halloween, so I like to get the whole family involved in prep – from my husband to the littles, everyone can help! I’ll encourage my daughter to see how clean she can get her teeth before all the candy eating, or challenge my husband to get the décor up and candy bowl filled in 10 minutes or less. It’s a little tricky – and a lot of fun – to make the day before Halloween a fun family task and an extension of the spooky holiday!Turn the Sunday Scaries into Sunday smiles with Crest and show us your Halloween Eve routine by tagging @Crest on social.About CrestA trusted leader in oral health, Crest was the first oral care brand to secure the ADA Seal of Acceptance for a clinically proven fluoride toothpaste.

(Nasdaq: SRCL), today announced the findings of its third annual U.S. Consumer Trends in Patient Engagement Survey, conducted by Ipsos, which surveyed 1,004 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey examined patients’ current preferences when engaging with their medical providers, highlighting new trends related to non-traditional venues of healthcare, generational differences in patient engagement, and current communication preferences.The findings from the survey reinforce the need for health systems to streamline appointment scheduling to improve care access, foster engagement to drive health awareness and action, and communicate and engage patients using multichannel strategies to accommodate fluctuating preferences.""The results of our third annual patient engagement survey highlight the generational variations in preferences among patients, especially as the accessibility of obtaining medical care at non-traditional venues has increased,"" said Matt Dickson, senior vice president of Stericycle Communication Solutions. ""As we head into 2023, hospitals and health systems should strive to ensure that patients don’t feel disconnected from their healthcare journeys, that reputation management is prioritized, and that the value of human connection and empathy is never forgotten. Connecting patients with the right venue of care at the right time is paramount and impacts outcomes, satisfaction, and healthcare costs.""Key report findings reveal that:Healthcare consumers are pursuing non-traditional care venuesOverall, 45% of respondents have received care at a non-traditional care venue outside of their primary care physician's (PCP's) office, and 81% of those respondents received their care in the last year. For those seeking non-traditional care, the survey revealed that a retail location is the most common venue of care (50.5%), followed by virtual care (33.6%), care via an app (11%), and subscription/membership-based care (4.9%). Ninety-five percent of those who pursued non-traditional care indicated they would visit again , but 41% of respondents revealed that their healthcare experience at a non-traditional care venue felt disjointed from the rest of their medical care. This indicates that certain medical needs are best addressed within the hospital or health system to ensure a positive patient journey.Story continuesPatients use online scheduling and also value live voice interactionsThere has been continued adoption of online scheduling, with about half of adults (48%) using online/mobile self-scheduling to book a medical appointment in the last year, though 11% of respondents reported their provider did not offer online scheduling. Health systems should also give consumers the option to speak with a live voice agent. In fact, 57% of patients scheduled their most recent appointment by phone, and nearly nine in 10 respondents schedule appointments by phone at least some of the time.Most medical appointments are in person, but telehealth is preferred for certain specialtiesRegarding respondents’ most recent PCP visit in the last year, 93% were in person versus virtually. Although 44% of those surveyed prefer in-person visits with all providers, telehealth visits continue to be a prominent option. Among those who are open to telehealth for some providers, primary care (55%) and mental health (45%) are the most commonly preferred virtual appointments.Healthcare consumers use online resources to select a physicianPatients have more options than ever when it comes to finding a physician. Therefore, hospitals and health systems should understand the impact of online reviews. The survey verified that online physician reviews can impact a consumer’s decision to seek care with them. Fifty-four percent of all respondents reported that online reviews moderately or severely impacted their decision. When seeking a new healthcare provider, online reviews are much more likely to impact the decisions of younger adults.To learn more about what the research findings mean for healthcare systems, visit here.About Stericycle Communication SolutionsStericycle Communication Solutions is an industry leading provider of patient engagement solutions, providing online scheduling, automated messaging, and strategic inbound and outbound call center services to drive patient access, action and adherence.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -42.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.89 billion, down 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Franklin Resources?For Franklin Resources, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Franklin Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Franklin Resources would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of +12.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Franklin Resources doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsPrincipal Financial (PFG), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -14.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.05 billion, down 15.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Principal Financial has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.92%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Principal Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Try Ethics.,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-leadership-insights-want-better-152500745.html,1666711500,STORY,['ETN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 25, 2022 / EatonEaton, Tuesday, October 25, 2022, Press release pictureRecently I listened to a TED Talk by Erika Cheung, one of the key whistleblowers in the Theranos scandal, who asks, ""How do we make speaking up the norm and not the exception?"" As Eaton's Senior Vice President of Ethics and Compliance, I believe we should all be asking that same question every day. When speaking up is part of the company culture, employees feel empowered. When it is not, employees feel powerless and companies pay the price.To avoid a culture of silence, I believe companies must take an intentional approach to ethics. First, it must be clear across the enterprise that everyone owns ethics. Second, leadership must set the tone from the top and, more importantly, walk the talk by modeling courageous and ethical behavior and encouraging their teams to do the same. As our Chairman and CEO, Craig Arnold puts it: ""Doing business right must be at the core of all we do"" and cascade ""throughout the organization."" We cannot treat ethics as separate from the business strategy; rather, we must incorporate ethics into the business strategy itself.We all know that actions speak louder than words. And it is equally true that we value what we give time to. That is why I believe leaders must regularly incorporate ethics and compliance topics as agenda items during meetings and reviews. They should also routinely share ethics and compliance data, trends and lessons learned with their teams. Most importantly, companies must prioritize ethics at the highest levels. This means the Ethics and Compliance team should serve as business partners and have a seat at the table during strategic planning sessions and operating reviews. That is what we do at Eaton.To evaluate whether your company is building this type of culture, I encourage leaders to ask a few pivotal questions: Does your company define ethics and compliance by a once-a-year, mandatory training exercise? Or are your leaders consistently reinforcing an environment where employees are comfortable reporting concerns? Does your company view ethics as everyone's responsibility-or as something only periodically discussed?Story continuesTransparency is critical-with the board, with employees and with stakeholders generally. I have also found that publishing an annual ethics report is invaluable. At Eaton, we call it our ""Integrity Report."" It further clarifies a company's commitment to ethics and creates an opening for discussion. And it can help build trust. By sharing key metrics, investigations and learnings, employees are more confident speaking up because they see and feel the commitment of their enterprise. I also find that publishing ethics-focused interviews with leaders and consistent messaging across multiple platforms can reinforce a culture of ethics.It is encouraging to see, but not surprising, that a values-based culture can even build a more profitable company. How? Ethical companies often see higher engagement, more productivity and lower turnover. According to the Ethisphere Institute, a leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, the world's most ethical companies in 2022 outperformed a comparable index of large-cap companies by 24.6 percentage points from January 2017 to January 2022.There is more. Another report revealed managers who frequently discussed ethics and compliance found their employees to be:Two times more likely to be comfortable approaching their manager with concerns or questions;Ninety percent more likely to have faith in their manager's commitment to non-retaliation; andTwenty-four percent more likely to believe they have a personal responsibility for making sure the company does the right thing.Today, customers and stakeholders not only expect-but demand-that companies behave ethically, transparently and sustainably. As business leaders, we all have a responsibility to deliver on those expectations.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eaton on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EatonWebsite: https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/sustainability.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EatonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722216/Eaton-Leadership-Insights-Want-Better-Business-Results-Try-Ethics]"

Dyslin Named Successor,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eric-m-kirsch-retire-global-200500031.html,1666728300,STORY,['AFL'],"[COLUMBUS, Ga., Oct. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Aflac Incorporated today announced that Eric Kirsch, executive vice president and global chief investment officer; president of Aflac Global Investments, will retire from Aflac, effective March 31, 2023. Kirsch will be succeeded by Bradley Dyslin, deputy global chief investment officer; senior managing director; global head of credit and strategic investment opportunities. Dyslin will officially start his new role on January 1, 2023, with Kirsch serving as executive vice president in transition before retiring effective March 31, 2023.Kirsch joined Aflac 11 years ago with a mandate to build a world-class global investment team. Leveraging his more than 30 years of asset management experience at the time, he was responsible for building a brand new investment platform in New York City that was globally integrated with a Tokyo-based investments team. Kirsch oversaw the design and growth of Aflac Global Investments, including hiring a high-quality leadership team and creating a disciplined approach to managing the general account emphasizing asset allocation, diversification, liquidity and risk management. Over his tenure, he was responsible for applying these practices to more than $120 billion of assets under management (AUM), consistently outperforming investment performance targets, while structuring a high-quality portfolio with a distinguished credit track record. Under Kirsch's leadership, Aflac Global Investments has established itself as a leading insurance asset manager across public and private assets, currency strategies, and alternatives, while incorporating ESG principles of investing. More recently under his leadership, Aflac Global Investments has established itself as a strategic partner to third-party asset managers through joint ventures and minority equity stakes, gaining access to specialty asset classes and business growth opportunities.  He was named a Top 30 Chief Investment Officer by Trusted Insight in 2014 and a Top Power 100 Power Player in Investment Management in 2015, 2016 and 2019 by Chief Investment Officer Magazine.Story continuesDyslin, one of the original executives Kirsch hired when building out the investment platform, has more than 30 years of investment experience in insurance asset management. In early 2021, Dyslin was promoted to deputy global chief investment officer, recognizing his contributions to the platform and his leadership capabilities. He joined Aflac Global Investments in 2012 as managing director and global head of credit, responsible for over $93 billion of credit AUM globally. He implemented a new credit function with rigorous underwriting standards that led to significant improvement in portfolio quality, while becoming a core investment strength. In 2017, he expanded his role to co-lead the external management platform responsible for asset outsourcing and overseeing third-party managers. While in this role, assets managed by third parties increased to $12 billion, with a specialty focus on corporate and real estate loans that helped improve portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted new money yields. Under Dyslin's leadership, Aflac Global Investments has developed strategic partnerships with third-party asset managers, including joint ventures and equity ownership stakes. Prior to joining Aflac, he served in a variety of investment management roles at Principal Financial Group, Deutsche Asset Management and Hartford Investment Management.Commenting on the announcement, Daniel P. Amos, Aflac Incorporated chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""I am grateful for Eric's leadership, dedication, and contributions to Aflac over the last 11 years. Eric has successfully built a leading global investment team while managing a well-diversified portfolio that has mitigated risk and added substantial income resulting in substantial value for Aflac and its shareholders.

498,41e5d322-405f-321c-8a35-ffbd1ef54f7f,AFL,2022-10-26,Unum (UNM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unum-unm-reports-next-week-140202904.html,1666706522,STORY,"['UNM', 'AFL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Unum (UNM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +35.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.98 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum?For Unum, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Unum would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.91, delivering a surprise of +55.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Unum doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Aflac (AFL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -20.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.63 billion, down 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Aflac has been revised 0.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.21%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

499,4b90eb03-707e-3ceb-ba72-214c8fbc22ee,FRT,2022-10-26,3 REITs with the Most Reliable Dividends,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-most-reliable-dividends-114019805.html,1666698019,STORY,"['O', 'FRT', 'NNN']","[The two essential characteristics of income stocks investors look for when considering a purchase of real estate investment trusts (REITs) are safety and reliability of the dividend.Safety means that the dividend is well covered by the company’s funds from operation. Reliability speaks to the history of dividend payments. Are they consistent over time without cuts or eliminations? Here are three REITs with the most reliable dividends that investors can count on through good times and bad:Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT) is a North Bethesda, Maryland-based diversified REIT that owns shopping malls, office buildings and residential units. Federal Realty Investment Trust, a member of the S&amp;P 500, has been in business since 1962 and is one of the oldest REITs on Wall Street. It owns 105 commercial properties with some 3,100 tenants and 3,400 residential units, mostly on the East and West coasts of the U.S.Federal Realty Investment Trust holds the REIT record for annual dividend increases of 55 years and counting. It recently increased its quarterly dividend from $1.07 to $1.08, and the $4.32 annual dividend now yields 4.7%. The dividend is well covered by annual FFO, which Federal Realty Investment Trust recently forecasted to be in a range from $6.10 to $6.25.On Oct. 19, Jefferies Financial Group hiked its third-quarter earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for Federal Realty Investment Trust from $1.52 to $1.53. Federal Realty Investment Trust could be the most reliable dividend provider in the universe of REIT stocks.Coming in second behind Federal Realty Investment Trust is Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O), a retail REIT that calls itself The Monthly Dividend Company.Realty Income owns and operates over 11,400 commercial properties under long-term net lease contracts. Its tenants are large, well-known companies like Walgreens Co., 7-Eleven Inc., CVS Pharmacy Inc., Lowe’s Cos. Inc., Dollar General Corp., FedEx Corp. and Walmart Inc.Story continuesA member of the S&amp;P 500, Realty Income is also a member of the Dividend Aristocrats Index for 53 years of providing monthly dividend income to shareholders. It has increased the dividend 117 times since going public in 1994. Its most recent quarterly FFO of $0.99 cents per share is more than ample for paying out $0.745 over three months. The current yield on the annual income of $2.98 is 5.1%.For safety and reliability, income investors have been able to count on Realty Income Corp. over the years, and this trend may well continue for decades to come.National Retail Properties Inc. (NYSE: NNN) is similar to Realty Income in that it owns a diversified group of well-known retail outlets with tenants that include 7-Eleven, Best Buy Co. Inc., BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. and Camping World Holdings Inc.. Its occupancy rate is over 99% with an average lease term of over 10 years.When you click on National Retail Properties’ website, the first words that greet you are “The power of consistency is profound.” That is true for this REIT.National Retail Properties has raised its dividends for over 33 consecutive years. Its most recent quarterly FFO was $0.77, easily covering the $0.55 quarterly dividend. Over the past five years, National Retail Properties has raised its dividend by 15.7%. The current dividend yields 5.5% and could provide safety and consistency to income investors for a very long time.See more on real estate investing from Benzinga:This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?There's No Bear Market For This Real Estate Fund...

All right, we're finally in that new home, regardless of the rate that we're paying for it long term, yeah, we've got some painting to do. So Sherman-- Sherwin-William-- Sherwin-Williams, perhaps, the net beneficiary of that. But yeah, record net sales results.]"

(NYSE: UHS) announced today that its reported net income attributable to UHS was $182.8 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2022, as compared to $218.4 million, or $2.60 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2021. Net revenues increased by 5.7% to $3.336 billion during the third quarter of 2022 as compared to $3.156 billion during the third quarter of 2021.As reflected on the Schedule of Non-GAAP Supplemental Information (""Supplemental Schedule""), our adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2022 was $185.8 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, as compared to $224.1 million, or $2.67 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2021.Included in our reported and adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 was an aggregate of $25.3 million in Quality Incentive Fund (""QIF"") payments, applicable to the period of September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021, recorded by certain of our acute care hospitals located in Texas in connection with the state's Uniform Hospital Rate Increase Program (""UHRIP"") program. This revenue was earned pursuant to contract terms with various Medicaid managed care plans which requires the annual payout of QIF funds when a managed care service delivery area's actual claims based UHRIP payments are less than targeted UHRIP payments for a specific rate year. We anticipate that these hospitals may be entitled to an additional $5 million of QIF revenue during the fourth quarter of 2022, increasing the 2022 aggregate to approximately $30 million. We also anticipate that these hospitals may be entitled to a comparable amount of aggregate QIF revenue during 2023.Story continuesAs reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, included in our reported results during the third quarter of 2022, was an unfavorable after-tax unrealized loss of $3.0 million, or $.04 per diluted share, ($3.9 million pre-tax which is included in ""Other (income) expense, net""), resulting from a decrease in the market value of certain equity securities.As reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, included in our reported results during the third quarter of 2021, was a net aggregate unfavorable after-tax impact of $5.8 million, or $.07 per diluted share, consisting primarily of the following: (i) an after-tax charge of $12.9 million, or $.15 per diluted share, ($16.8 million pre-tax which is included in ""Other (income) expense, net"") recorded in connection with costs related to extinguishment of debt, partially offset by; (ii) an after-tax unrealized gain of $6.8 million, or $.08 per diluted share, ($8.9 million pre-tax which is included in ""Other (income) expense, net""), resulting from an increase in the market value of shares of certain equity securities.As calculated on the attached Supplemental Schedule, our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization (""EBITDA net of NCI"", NCI is net income attributable to noncontrolling interests), was $421.7 million during the third quarter of 2022, as compared to $441.5 million during the third quarter of 2021.

Net revenues generated from our acute care services on a same facility basis increased by 4.6% during the first nine months of 2022, as compared to the comparable nine-month period of 2021.Behavioral Health Care Services – Three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:During the third quarter of 2022, at our behavioral health care facilities on a same facility basis, adjusted admissions increased by 4.0% while adjusted patient days increased by 3.3%, as compared to the third quarter of 2021.

Net revenues generated from our behavioral health care services increased by 4.1% during the first nine months of 2022, as compared to the comparable period of 2021.COVID-19 and Staffing Shortage The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began during the second half of March, 2020, has had a material effect on our operations and financial results since that time. The length and extent of the disruptions caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic are currently unknown; however, we expect such disruptions to continue into the future. Since the future volumes and severity of COVID-19 patients remain highly uncertain and subject to change, including potential increases in future COVID-19 patient volumes caused by new variants of the virus, as well as related pressures on staffing and wage rates, we are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our future financial results. However, future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to materially affect our financial performance.The nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing us and other healthcare providers. Like others in the healthcare industry, we continue to experience a shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel at our acute care and behavioral health care hospitals in many geographic areas. In some areas, the labor scarcity is putting a strain on our resources and staff, which has required us to utilize higher‑cost temporary labor and pay premiums above standard compensation for essential workers. This staffing shortage has required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, we have been unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, have been required to limit patient volumes. These factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations during the first nine months of 2022, are expected to continue to have an unfavorable material impact on our results of operations for the foreseeable future.However, as previously disclosed on June 30, 2022, our revised operating results forecast for the balance of 2022 assumed that staffing vacancies and the corresponding premium pay expenditures continue to sequentially decline in the second half of the year and that non-COVID patient volumes will incrementally improve, although both at a slower pace than our original forecast anticipated. We believe these assumptions will be bolstered by our continuing recruitment and retention initiatives, by changes to our historical patient care models, by other cost cutting measures and by aggressive contractual negotiations and renegotiations with our managed care payers.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and Liquidity:Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, our net cash provided by operating activities was $699 million as compared to $562 million during the comparable nine-month period of 2021. The $137 million net increase in our net cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2022, as compared to the first nine months of 2021, was due to: (i) a favorable change of $695 million resulting from the early return of Medicare accelerated payments which were received during 2020 and repaid during the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by; (ii) an unfavorable change of $245 million resulting from a decrease in net income plus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, gain/loss on sales of assets and businesses, costs related to extinguishment of debt and provision for asset impairment; (iii) an unfavorable change of $227 million from other working capital accounts due primarily to the timing of disbursements for accrued compensation; (iv) an unfavorable change of $126 million in accounts receivable, and; (v) $40 million of other combined net favorable changes.Liquidity:As of September 30, 2022, we had $1.007 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit.Stock Repurchase Program:As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate remaining repurchase authorization of approximately $358 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. In February of 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.4 billion increase to the program. As of September 30, 2022, we had an aggregate available repurchase authorization of $1.05 billion.Pursuant to the terms of our stock repurchase program, shares of our Class B Common Stock may be repurchased, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. During the third quarter of 2022, we have repurchased approximately 1.60 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $157.9 million (approximately $99 per share) pursuant to the program. During the first nine months of 2022, we have repurchased approximately 5.85 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $703.7 million (approximately $120 per share) pursuant to the program.Conference call information:We will hold a conference call for investors and analysts at 9:00 a.m. eastern time on October 26, 2022.

For additional information visit www.uhs.com.This press release contains forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. Numerous factors, including those disclosed herein, those related to the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial results, those related to healthcare industry trends and those detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as set forth in Item 2-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and in Item 1A-Risk Factors and in Item 7-Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021), may cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and therefore actual results may differ materially. Readers should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements which reflect management's view only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Many of the factors that could affect our future results are beyond our control or ability to predict, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future operations and financial results will likely be materially unfavorably impacted by developments related to COVID-19 including, but not limited to, the potential impact on future COVID-19 patient volumes resulting from new variants of the virus, the length of time and severity of the spread of the pandemic; the volume of cancelled or rescheduled elective procedures and the volume of COVID-19 patients treated at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities; measures we are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of government and administrative regulation and stimulus on the hospital industry and potential retrospective adjustment in future periods of CARES Act and other grant income revenues recorded as revenues in prior periods; declining patient volumes and unfavorable changes in payer mix caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions (including increases in uninsured and underinsured patients as the result of business closings and layoffs); potential disruptions to our clinical staffing and shortages and disruptions related to supplies required for our employees and patients; potential increases to expenses and other costs related to staffing, supply chain, construction and medical equipment costs and other expenditures resulting from inflation; the impact of our substantial indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, as well as risks associated with disruptions in the financial markets and the business of financial institutions as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic which could impact us from a financing perspective; and changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in our markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, please see the disclosure above in COVID-19 and Staffing Shortage, in connection with the nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations.We believe that adjusted net income attributable to UHS, adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share, EBITDA net of NCI and Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI, which are non-GAAP financial measures (""GAAP"" is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America), are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that, when applicable, comparing and discussing our financial results based on these measures, as calculated, is helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect of material items impacting our net income attributable to UHS, such as, changes in the market value of shares of certain equity securities and other potential material items that are nonrecurring or non-operational in nature including, but not limited to, impairments of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, reserves for various matters including settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, costs related to extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income attributable to UHS, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Since the items included or excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Since these measures, as presented, are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.Universal Health Services, Inc.Consolidated Statements of Income(in thousands, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three monthsNine monthsended September 30,ended September 30,2022202120222021Net revenues$3,336,027$3,155,999$9,952,390$9,366,866Operating charges: Salaries, wages and benefits1,677,4311,556,4485,061,1734,542,156 Other operating expenses837,241754,0722,526,0602,233,590 Supplies expense366,337367,8341,092,4031,052,977 Depreciation and amortization145,874134,462433,508399,850 Lease and rental expense33,26428,37597,07588,8483,060,1472,841,1919,210,2198,317,421Income from operations275,880314,808742,1711,049,445Interest expense, net35,65321,19983,00264,455Other (income) expense, net6,0156,71915,244(1,575)Income before income taxes234,212286,890643,925986,565Provision for income taxes57,40167,515157,312232,844Net income176,811219,375486,613753,721Less: Net income (loss) attributable tononcontrolling interests (""NCI"")(6,003)1,024(14,176)1,255Net income attributable to UHS$182,814$218,351$500,789$752,466Basic earnings per share attributable to UHS (a)$2.52$2.65$6.78$8.96Diluted earnings per share attributable to UHS (a)$2.50$2.60$6.71$8.83Universal Health Services, Inc.Footnotes to Consolidated Statements of Income(in thousands, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three monthsNine months(a) Earnings per share calculation:ended September 30,ended September 30,2022202120222021Basic and diluted:Net income attributable to UHS$182,814$218,351$500,789$752,466Less: Net income attributable to unvested restricted share grants(179)(396)(592)(1,609)Net income attributable to UHS - basic and diluted$182,635$217,955$500,197$750,857Weighted average number of common shares - basic72,59582,26273,76983,756Basic earnings per share attributable to UHS:$2.52$2.65$6.78$8.96Weighted average number of common shares72,59582,26273,76983,756Add: Other share equivalents4651,4117431,275Weighted average number of common shares and equiv. - diluted73,06083,67374,51285,031Diluted earnings per share attributable to UHS:$2.50$2.60$6.71$8.83Universal Health Services, Inc.Schedule of Non-GAAP Supplemental Information (""Supplemental Schedule"")For the Three Months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021(in thousands, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Calculation of Earnings/Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA/Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI"")Three months ended% NetThree months ended]"

This has outpaced the Medical sector's gain of 3.34% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.94% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Regeneron as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 3, 2022.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.79 billion, down 19.07% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $41.05 per share and revenue of $11.78 billion.

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders disposed of US$16m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-130043257.html,1666702843,STORY,['REGN'],"[Over the past year, many Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, George Sing, for US$7.0m worth of shares, at about US$660 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$737, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 23% of George Sing's holding.In the last year Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. In total, Independent Director Arthur Ryan sold US$4.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Regeneron PharmaceuticalsLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, worth about US$3.3b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may not be the best stock to buy.

Health Trends reports in 2020 and 2021 have focused on important insights gained during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic, including identifying significant declines in routine cancer screenings1 as well as in recommended screenings for Americans at high risk for other serious medical conditions, including hepatitis C (HCV),2 sexually transmitted infections (STIs),3 and diabetes management.4Quest Diagnostics , Tuesday, October 25, 2022, Press release pictureImpact of pandemic-delayed testing and treatment""We need to not only resume testing and treatment, but increase them above pre-pandemic levels to identify people who have delayed or skipped healthcare services. For serious and chronic conditions, a screening test is the first, and most critical, step."" Harvey W. Kaufman, MD Senior Medical Director, Head of Health Trends ResearchParticularly during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, nonemergent ambulatory and outpatient clinic services were limited to preserve healthcare resources for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19. Combined with other restrictions, generalized fear about the risk of contagion, and increased unemployment with loss of healthcare benefits, these limits had multiple unintended consequences, including decreases in screening that have already caused significant delays in diagnoses.As a result, detection and diagnosis are happening at advanced stages rather than during early disease when treatment is most effective. Ultimately, this deferred care may lead to increases in late-stage disease, associated morbidity, and mortality.5~60% of US adults delayed or skipped some in-person medical treatments or appointments during the pandemic, particularly Hispanic/Latinx adults (67%) as compared to White and Black adults (59% and 58%, respectively).6Concerns about exposure to the virus topped the list of reasons why US adults delayed or avoided in-person healthcare (53%), but many also recognize that this has now led to other health issues, including delayed diagnosis or treatment (18% and 23%, respectively) and worsening of symptoms (17%).6Story continuesCancer diagnoses have increased""In the past years, we've made so many therapeutic advances in cancer care, but if a cancer isn't diagnosed, it can't be treated."" Kristie M. Dolan Vice President and General Manager, OncologyOn August 31, 2021, original research from Quest Diagnostics scientists was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open7 confirming one of the most dire unintended consequences of mitigation efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic: new diagnoses of the 8 most common cancer types in the US sharply declined during most of March 2020 to March 2021, the first year of the pandemic. This included cases of breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, esophageal, cervical, and gastric cancers.After significant decreases in the rate of cancer death from 1991 to 2017,8 these crucial gains may be lost due to patients' inability or reluctance to seek care, including regular cancer screenings, because of fear of the COVID-19 virus. In addition, the increased numbers of employees who lost their jobs due to business closures and COVID-19 mandates means a dramatic rise in numbers of Americans who were and may continue to be uninsured and thus even more reluctant to seek healthcare.Without routine screenings, the ability to diagnose early-stage cancers when they are most treatable is greatly reduced. Accordingly, many healthcare providers predict an upcoming wave of patients who were living with undiagnosed cancers during the pandemic who are later diagnosed with advanced cancers, requiring more aggressive treatment and resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.9Detectable lead levels in children's bloodA study from Quest Diagnostics and Boston Children's Hospital found that 1 in 2 (50.5%) American children under 6 years of age tested have detectable levels of lead, a toxic metal, in their blood.4 It is the first study of its size and scale to examine blood lead levels (BLLs) as low as 1.0 μg/dL, which the researchers deemed ""detectable"" BLL. The researchers found that of the children tested10 :50.5% had a detectable BLL of ≥1.0 μg/dL1.9% had elevated BLL of ≥5.0 ug/dLThe research indicates that most American children have been exposed to lead, despite decades of public policy to reduce lead poisoning. A neurotoxin that causes irreversible health effects, including lower IQ, lead is found in many settings, including older homes, water pipes, areas with heavy industry, and some consumer products.""Our Quest analysis finds that while exposure to the highest levels of lead has declined in recent years, most American children are exposed to lead, a substance that, according to the CDC, is not safe for children at any level. Moreover, our analysis finds that kids in areas with the highest rates of poverty are also the most at risk, highlighting the critical role of social disparities in health,"" notes Senior Medical Director and Head of Health Trends Research Harvey W. Kaufman, MD.Physicians worry about missing signs of drug misuse and fear fentanyl will be deadlier than opioids""Clinical drug testing gives physicians the ability to uncover insights into problematic drug use before the worst outcomes can occur. [Although] our research shows that physicians overwhelmingly value clinical drug testing in patient management… there remains an unmet need for clear clinical guidelines regarding when and how to test, which tests to use, and the frequency of testing."" Jeffrey Gudin, MD Senior Medical Advisor, Drug Monitoring and ToxicologyBased on a first-of-its-kind study conducted by Quest Diagnostics, the Health Trends report Drug Misuse in America 202111 examines the contributing factors to the significant increase in overdose deaths seen during the pandemic and provides insights on barriers health professionals face in their ability to monitor and intervene with their patients at risk for drug misuse.11Key findings from the report include11:The pandemic worsened the drug crisis, and physicians anticipate a continuing rise in overdose deathsPhysicians worry that they have missed signs of drug misuse during the pandemic and express concerns about recognizing signs of drug misuse during telehealth sessionsPhysicians fear that illicit fentanyl will claim more lives than prescribed opioidsDespite physician confidence in counseling patients, nearly half of tested patients show drug misuseClinical drug testing is deemed critical, but clearer guidelines would help optimize its useRead more1.

The benefit of higher interest rates was offset by market depreciation and unfavorable foreign exchange translation.Perspective from Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer""Ameriprise delivered another good quarter demonstrating the strength of our business and ability to navigate periods of heightened volatility and market dislocation.""Our advice value proposition and deep client relationships differentiate Ameriprise. In the quarter, total client net flows were up significantly to more than $11 billion, and we continue to generate good growth in advisor productivity. In addition, growth in our cash business and Bank drove higher spread income in Wealth Management that more than offset equity market depreciation in our businesses.""The business consistently generates strong free cash flow from contributions across our diversified firm that we invest in the business and return to shareholders. Our balance sheet remains a core strength, and in the quarter, we returned $632 million to shareholders and remain on track to return 90% of our adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year, building on our long record of attractive shareholder returns.""Third quarter GAAP net income per diluted share was $4.86 compared to $8.65 a year ago, primarily reflecting the net realized gains on investments related to the fixed annuity reinsurance transaction in the prior year period.Adjusted operating net revenue was $3.5 billion, a 1 percent increase driven by strong Wealth Management growth, partially offset by lower revenue from Asset Management due to market depreciation.Assets under management and administration were $1.1 trillion, down 9 percent, as significant market depreciation more than offset $64 billion of cumulative net inflows over the past twelve months.Ameriprise Bank approximately doubled in size from a year ago to $18.6 billion. The Bank represents a significant opportunity to capture sustainable benefits from widening spreads and rising rates. The gross fee yield increased nearly 100 basis points sequentially.Long-term investment performance at Columbia Threadneedle Investments remains excellent with 130 funds with 4- and 5-star Morningstar ratings and more than 70 percent of funds above median on an asset-weighted basis over 3-, 5- and 10-year time periods.The company returned $632 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and remains on track to return 90 percent of operating earnings to shareholders during the year.(1) Return on equity excluding AOCI is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis.(2) Unlocking impacts reflect the company’s annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and model changes, and the Long Term Care (LTC) gross premium valuation.Story continuesAmeriprise Financial, Inc.Third Quarter SummaryQuarter EndedSeptember 30,% Over/(Under)Year-to-dateSeptember 30,% Over/(Under)(in millions, except per share amounts, unaudited)2022202120222021GAAP net income$548$1,031(47)%$2,065$2,059-Adjusted operating earnings$591$699(15)%$1,951$2,001(2)%Adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking (see reconciliation starting on p. 25)$725$7053%$2,085$2,0074%GAAP net income per diluted share$4.86$8.65(44)%$18.05$17.036%Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share$5.24$5.86(11)%$17.05$16.553%Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share excluding unlocking (see reconciliation starting on p. 25)$6.43$5.919%$18.23$16.6010%GAAP Return on Equity, ex.

Distribution expenses declined 7 percent, while G&amp;A and other expenses were $393 million, reflecting investments for business growth and higher volume-related activity from continued cumulative net flows. In addition, G&amp;A expenses a year ago were unusually low as a result of the timing of expenses, lower staffing levels and limited T&amp;E expense. On year-to-date basis, G&amp;A expenses increased 7 percent, which was in line with management expectations.The Wealth Management business delivered strong fundamental growth in the quarter with total client net flows up 11 percent to $11.2 billion in the face of volatile markets.

Institutional inflows continued to partially offset elevated retail outflows.Retail net outflows were $5.3 billion. In North America, there were outflows in equity and fixed income strategies from market volatility.

This includes integration between Webex Control Hub and Cisco Spaces to improve the return-to-office experience, and audio watermarking to protect confidential meeting content.SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 25, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, at WebexOne 2022, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) made several key announcements, including major updates to the Webex Suite, a new collaboration device and new partnerships to expand its collaboration footprint. To help customers large and small solve the myriad of challenges they're grappling with as offices reopen, Cisco's innovations enhance workspaces and empower people with the flexibility to ""work their way"" – all while being easy to use and manage.WebexOne 2022""Hybrid work is both different and harder than how we worked before. Regardless of job function – frontline worker, knowledge worker, IT admin or contact center agent – people expect and deserve an amazing experience no matter where or how they work,"" said Jeetu Patel, EVP and GM, Cisco Security and Collaboration. ""This requires a holistic solution that only Cisco can deliver with its integrated platform across collaboration software, devices, networking and security.""Reimagined workspaces in the office, at home and everywhere in between98% of meetings will have remote video attendees. Yet only 11% of meeting rooms are video enabled (Frost &amp; Sullivan ""State of the Global Video Conferencing Devices Market, October 2022""). Both home offices and office spaces require video devices to help people collaborate and feel their best. And with a 2022 survey of customers finding that 85% use more than one meeting platform, it's critical those video devices provide seamless interoperability with the platforms colleagues and customers use. New partnerships and capabilities:Story continuesCisco Partners with Microsoft: Cisco is partnering with Microsoft, enabling the Microsoft Teams Rooms experience on Cisco's industry-leading collaboration devices wherever people choose to work. Customers and IT benefit from the best quality, highly inclusive and manageable set of devices with Cisco, along with the flexibility to choose their collaboration experience.  New Collaboration Device: The new Cisco Room Kit EQ is one of the industry's most advanced collaboration device solutions for large workspaces. Powered by the Cisco Codec EQ, an AI-based computing appliance, the Room Kit EQ enables true-to-life meeting experiences, bringing seamless integration to video-enable and transform large spaces for inclusive hybrid work.Hybrid Workspace Blueprint: For the first time Cisco is offering a repeatable Hybrid Workspace Design Guide, based on its NYC office deployment, to help customers design next-generation hybrid workspaces. It encompasses Cisco's Smart Building Solutions, collaboration, networking, security technology and more. Cisco's approach connects the intersection of people, space and technology. It supports triple-screens, offers embedded camera and audio intelligence, including automatic noise cancelation, and the option to switch to bring your own device (BYOD) collaboration, so customers can unlock the true potential of hybrid work.Flexible workstyles put people at the center Because there's no single way of working and an entire spectrum of interaction types, organizations must support all types and styles of work and events. Notable new Webex innovations supporting these interaction types:New Whiteboard App: One of the most critical issues of hybrid work is enabling workers in and out of the office to brainstorm or sketch on a whiteboard in meetings or spontaneously. With the new Webex Whiteboard app in the Webex Suite, users benefit from a simple, easy-to-use whiteboarding experience regardless of where they're working. Anyone can start or join a whiteboard and work together from a browser, the Webex App, or a Cisco device. Whiteboards can be combined with Slido polls, saved and shared in a Webex space for asynchronous ideation.Asynchronous Video: To give people time back and free them from endless meetings, Cisco introduced its asynchronous video offering Vidcast, part of the Webex Suite, last year. Vidcast, now generally available, has since saved 47 million meeting minutes and over 40 new innovations make the experience even more powerful. Among the new features will be a new AI-powered editing capability that drastically reduces the time it takes to create polished content, and Slido integration to incorporate polling and audience engagement into shared video content.Partnership with Apple: iPhone and iPad users can now share content from the rear-facing or front-facing camera via the Webex Meetings app and annotate over what they're seeing with Mobile Camera Share. For the first time customers benefit from effective collaboration by leveraging the high-quality video capture capabilities of Apple devices. For example, an architect or frontline worker can share job site progress with clients in real-time instead of sending static images or screenshots.Calling Innovations: Significant innovation in Webex Calling includes new integration with Microsoft Teams, enabling users to easily make enterprise-grade Webex Calls seamlessly in the Teams interface for a more flexible workflow. Additionally, Group Call Management is now available for Webex Calling. This capability makes it easy for businesses to activate informal call center services to elevate their customer calling experience, measure performance, improve staff training, and deliver results without needing a separate or specialized contact center application.Hybrid Events: Webex Events and Webinars provide the most comprehensive portfolio of hybrid event solutions, all from a single platform. Now users will have access to a new lobby experience for virtual events that will support a variety of customizations, such as agendas, speaker bios, sponsors, and more. New content widgets make it easy to embed any of those elements into external event websites. With new production tools in Webex Webinars, hosts can easily add custom branding and personalization to every event with the new Stage Manager. Integration into Network Device Interface (NDI) gives event production teams a new tool for professional broadcasts.Industry-leading collaboration security &amp; manageability Hybrid work requires comprehensive security and manageability to ensure the supporting IT operations are deployed, optimized, and monitored effectively and securely. New updates put the power into the hands of IT to:Audio Watermarking: Audio watermarking uniquely tags audio streams to every participant in a confidential meeting with a marker that cannot be heard by the human ear. This allows organizations to better protect intellectual property in today's hybrid world with more highly dispersed and remote teams. For example, if an employee were recording a meeting where confidential information is discussed, the company could trace that recording back to the individual regardless of how the audio was shared.Webex Control Hub integration with Cisco Spaces: Webex Control Hub is now integrated with Cisco Spaces. This integration offers employees critical information, such as real-time occupancy and air quality updates, that improves their experience when they come into the office. Facilities and real estate teams benefit from real-time data to simplify the complexity of reconfiguring and redesigning workspaces while supporting sustainability goals.IT Digital Coach: Control Hub as a Coach offers Webex customers an in-product digital coach that takes the complexity out of improving hybrid work experiences. Control Hub guides IT admins to achieve best practice set up, adoption quality, and create greater efficiency for managing and supporting workers.The Webex Suite is the industry's first suite for hybrid work that provides Cloud/On-Premise Calling, Messaging, Meetings, Polling, Whiteboarding, Asynchronous Video, Webinars and Events in a unified, highly secure offering.About Cisco Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide leader in technology that powers the Internet.

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 startups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.In response to the growing urgency to reverse climate change, we introduced five new Climate Impact and Regeneration prizes totaling $300,000 USD. These prizes recognize solutions that can reduce or remove greenhouse gas (GHG) from the environment or regenerate depleted ecosystems.I had the opportunity to meet with John Foye, CEO and Aakash Ahamed, CTO of Working Trees, which was awarded $50,000 USD as a Runner-Up for the Climate Impact &amp; Regeneration Prize. Working Trees provides a technology-based solution for farmers and ranchers to measure the carbon stored in silvopasture systems using a smartphone, making it possible for landowners of all sizes to access carbon markets and get paid for the carbon stored in their trees.Silvopasture is the intentional planting of trees on the same land where animals are being grazed to create conditions that are more desirable for livestock. The agricultural benefits of silvopasture include increased shade which provides drought tolerance for the pastures and heat resistance for the animals. It also offers forage for the animals in the form of foliage and fodder from the trees, in addition to absorbing and storing carbon.Working Trees launched the first agroforestry (tree planting in agricultural systems) carbon project in the U.S. in March 2022, with oak and pine seedlings planted at Lick Skillet Farm in Tennessee.Story continuesWhat problem is your technology solution trying to solve?John: At Working Trees, we recognize that tree planting gets a ton of press, but it doesn't happen at any real scale. Farmers and ranchers manage most of the land here on earth. If trees don't provide benefits for those who manage the land, trees aren't going to be planted. Working Trees makes it possible to grow trees in places where the interest of farmers and the climate overlap. We're focusing on livestock producers by offering them a way to generate income for the carbon stored in trees that they incorporate into new silvopasture systems.Aakash: Farmers and ranchers often face barriers that make it challenging for them to participate in carbon markets and receive payments for carbon stored on their land. These barriers are essentially related to cost. If a landowner manages a small acreage, they can't gain access to carbon markets due to high cost of monitoring and verification. Our technology is built to simplify monitoring and reporting and facilitate access to carbon markets for landowners of all sizes.Can you explain how the solution works?Aakash: The technology is a simple application that can be downloaded on a smartphone. It enables a user, typically a farmer or rancher, to measure the properties needed-diameter, height, and species-to estimate the amount of carbon stored in a tree. The farmer then collects a representative sample for their entire area of planting. They continue to collect these measurements over time to catalog the amount of carbon stored over time. They also collect photos of all the measurements, so we have a very high quality and auditable dataset of the tree properties which influence the amount of carbon being stored. This enables customers purchasing the carbon credits to be confident that they are contributing to a net negative carbon removal outcome.John: These seemingly simple measurements are all you need to run a carbon project. There's a ton of math that goes into how you pick your sampling and how you aggregate it appropriately to estimate the total carbon credits. Our sampling approach is currently being validated by carbon registries, which provide additional safeguards that the quantification approach is robust. An important part of establishing silvopasture is related to the upfront cost - it costs money now to put trees into the ground and the benefits materialize years in the future. To bridge this gap, we can pre-sell carbon credits to customers who are looking to lock in a long-term supply, allowing us to offer financing options to the farmer. Our measurement technology facilitates credit verification and generation, and we can use innovations in the carbon markets to provide financing for the farmer.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?John: We're the only entity focused on running agroforestry carbon projects. The reason we were able to launch the first agroforestry carbon project in America earlier this year is because of our unique approach in developing a technology-based solution. It allows us to generate high-quality, fully auditable ground truth data, whereas so much of the market is focused on using remote sensing which can be less accurate than on-the-ground sampling.Aakash: Typically, carbon projects are verified by teams of people taking measurements by hand with tools such as tape measures and range finders to determine the necessary tree properties to estimate carbon content. This is a manual process that can be cumbersome and costly. One of the advantages of using Working Trees' technology is that it provides a simple and auditable method to record these properties, and the farmer can complete these actions on a smartphone, eliminating the need to hire a third-party.What inspired you to develop this solution?John: I am motivated to get out of bed when I'm working on the long-term impact of climate and the shorter-term impact on humans, particularly rural economic development. My background is in rural solar project development. Most of the people I was working with were farmers, and I knew that I wanted to work within natural climate solutions and explore this area. This includes addressing how we store carbon in our agricultural systems, our forests, our soils, and our oceans that are managed by farmers, ranchers, and fishermen who don't have high incomes. This led me down a rabbit hole to figure out where I could potentially add value, and I was inspired by the prospect of incorporating trees into working agricultural systems due to the meaningful benefits.Aakash: Silvopasture practices have an impressive array of co-benefits such as reducing heat stress in livestock, increasing the water retention capacity and nutrient content of the soil, improving biodiversity, and limiting erosion. Coupled with the economic benefits to farmers of alternative revenue streams and more fodder for cattle and the huge carbon sequestration potential of agricultural lands, advancing silvopasture development, monitoring, and verification became our guiding north star.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Aakash: There are two refrains that John and I find ourselves coming back to. The first is focusing on what we can control and taking shots on goals-even if they don't pan out. The second is being patient with the long-term vision but being impatient with our short-term tasks. Striking this balance helps us stay motivated by our ambitious goals, while still incrementally making progress each day.John: Take the advice others give you with a huge grain of salt because every situation is different, every person is different, every company is different. Find a mission that you care a lot about-if you have a reason to hop out of bed, that's what matters way more than anything else.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722186/Working-Trees-How-a-Startup-Helps-Farmers-Get-Paid-for-Carbon-Stored-in-Their-Trees]"
