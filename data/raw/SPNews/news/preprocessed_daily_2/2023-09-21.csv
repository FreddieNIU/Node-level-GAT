The company's solid momentum across the China and international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. Notably, China commerce retail business is driven by rising online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall.Further, International retail business is riding on solid combined order growth. Moreover, strength across the Cainiao logistics services, owing to robust domestic consumer logistics and international fulfillment solution services is a plus.This apart, strength across cloud computing business and local services is a tailwind. However, macroeconomic uncertainties are concerns. Additionally, normalization of cloud demand as offline activities are resuming, is an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+43.7% vs. +32.1%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to rapidly growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.The company streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. TotalEnergies is steadily investing to expand its renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, the company's production has been impacted by security-related production cuts in some regions.

The resource base represents the company's strong footprint in prolific acres in the United States, comprising Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale.Also, the company is better positioned to rely on its strong balance sheet to withstand any adverse business scenario. However, due to the inflationary market, the company's overall operating and production expenses continue to increase, hurting the bottom line.ConocoPhillips' exploration and production activities are exposed to extreme volatility in oil and gas prices, making the overall business scenario of the upstream energy player extremely choppy.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Elevance Health, Inc. and The Charles Schwab Corp.Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Western Digital’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital What Is Western Digital Worth?Good news, investors! Western Digital is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $62.01, but it is currently trading at US$45.65 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Western Digital’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Western Digital look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Western Digital, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 8.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for Western Digital, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since WDC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WDC for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy WDC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for Western Digital (1 is potentially serious!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you are no longer interested in Western Digital, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

The proposed division would separate the company's traditional hard disk drives from its flash-based memory products, a sector it entered in 2016 following the $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk.The call for this split primarily came from Elliott Investment Management, an activist investment firm. In May 2022, Elliott sent a letter to Western Digital highlighting the company's operational, financial, and strategic underperformance due to managing two vastly different businesses within the same organization.Responding to Elliott's suggestions later that month, Western Digital's CEO David Goeckler acknowledged that the firm was exploring various strategic and financial alternatives to optimize its value, including a potential split. This announcement led to a rally in Western Digital's shares.In parallel with these developments, reports surfaced indicating that Western Digital was in merger discussions with Kioxia Holdings, its joint venture partner in flash memory production. Japan-based Kioxia is now reportedly negotiating with Japanese banks to refinance $14 billion in loans ahead of a possible merger with Western Digital's flash business.According to these reports, the merged entity would be 50.5% owned by Western Digital and 49.5% by Kioxia's current owners. It should be noted that Bain Capital owns 56.24% of Kioxia while Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) has a 40.64% stake. The proposed merger would exclude Western Digital's hard-drive business.Analysts have been closely monitoring these developments. Jordan Klein from Mizuho trading desk views Western Digital's shares as among the best long-term investments in the semiconductor sector due to recent capacity cutbacks in the NAND flash memory business seemingly pushing up spot market prices. Klein also highlighted increased production plans by Chinese smartphone manufacturers in response to strong sales.Story continuesBNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' Karl Ackerman has upgraded his rating on Western Digital shares from Neutral to Outperform, setting a price target of $58. Ackerman anticipates demand for both NAND flash memory and ""nearline"" hard drives - used for data that isn't immediately needed but is more readily available than off-site storage - to bottom out. Consequently, he expects Western Digital's stock to gradually rise as the strategic review concludes in the upcoming months.As of Wednesday, Western Digital shares were trading 4.5% higher at $45.90 in the afternoon trading.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

10,02d27c2d-b155-3bce-a07a-794ba360e64e,NUE,2023-09-21,U.S. Steelmakers Paint Tepid Q3 Picture as Steel Prices Retreat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-steelmakers-paint-tepid-q3-120900960.html,1695211740,STORY,"['STLD', 'X', 'NUE', 'PKX']","[The steel industry has lost some momentum after enjoying a solid run earlier this year as steel prices have witnessed a sharp downward correction from their April 2023 peak. However, the industry is benefiting from a demand recovery in automotive and a resilient non-residential construction market.Some prominent U.S. steel producers recently came up with their guidance for the September quarter. Nucor Corporation NUE was the first to divulge the outlook for the third quarter. It projects third-quarter earnings between $4.10 and $4.20 per share, which suggests a decline from $5.81 per share reported in the second quarter of 2023 and $6.50 per share in the third quarter of 2022.The expected decline in earnings for the third quarter of 2023 is primarily attributed to lower earnings in Nucor’s steel mills segment, which is anticipated to be impacted by lower pricing and, to a lesser extent, reduced volumes. The sheet mills within the segment are expected to experience the most significant impact on earnings.Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD also sees lower earnings in the third quarter, partly due to a decline in steel prices. It projects third-quarter earnings in the range of $3.46-$3.50 per share, which indicates a decline on both sequential and year-over-year basis. Third-quarter profitability in STLD's steel operations is expected to see a significant drop from the second quarter due to a contraction in metal spreads. Lower realized flat rolled steel prices are expected to more than offset the benefits of lower scrap costs. Steel shipments are anticipated to remain steady, excluding the lost volume related to an unplanned outage at Sinton in July, while steel order activity remains strong, Steel Dynamics noted.Meanwhile, United States Steel Corporation X expects to deliver strong performance in the third quarter on the back of higher selling prices in the flat-rolled unit and lower raw material costs. The results are expected to be supported by better-than-expected performance in each of the company’s operating segments, the steelmaker noted. However, the company’s guidance also reflects the expected impacts of the ongoing United Auto Workers (“UAW”) strike against Detroit’s big three automakers. U.S. Steel expects adjusted earnings for the quarter to be $1.10-$1.15 per share, reflecting a decline from $1.92 in the prior quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.Last month, U.S. Steel, in a letter addressed to its stockholders, informed that it is exploring strategic alternatives in response to multiple unsolicited proposals, including partial acquisitions and a complete buyout. The company has reportedly entered into confidentiality agreements with multiple third parties.Nucor, Steel Dynamics and U.S. Steel each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesPrices Soften, but Steady Demand Bodes WellSteel prices witnessed a significant correction globally in 2022 as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, skyrocketing energy costs in Europe, persistently high inflation, interest rate hikes and the slowdown in China due to new COVID-19 lockdowns dampened demand for steel across key end-use markets. Notably, U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war.The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand and fears of a recession. Nevertheless, HRC prices rebounded during the first three months of 2023, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, low import levels, supply tightness partly due to mill outages and a recovery in demand.However, HRC prices have retracted from their April 2023 peak of around $1,200 per short ton. Prices have fallen more than 40% from the highs hit in April, currently hovering around $700 per short ton. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. The UAW's strike against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis has also weighed on HRC prices of late. An extended strike could be detrimental for the U.S. steel industry given its impact on steel demand. The impacts of weaker steel prices are expected to reflect on the performance of U.S. steel companies in the third quarter.Nevertheless, U.S. steelmakers are expected to benefit from firm demand across major steel-consuming sectors such as construction and automotive in the third quarter. Steel demand in automotive has improved this year on the back of an easing global shortage in semiconductor chips that weighed heavily on the automotive industry for nearly two years. Order activities in the non-residential construction market also remain strong, underscoring the underlying strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has improved on the back of strength in oil and gas prices.  Healthy demand in major markets will likely support steel companies’ volumes in the third quarter.Steel Stocks Worth A WatchA few stocks currently worth a look in the steel space are Commercial Metals Company CMC, POSCO Holdings Inc. PKX and L.B. Foster Company FSTR.Commercial Metals carries a Zacks Rank #1. CMC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters while missing once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6.6%, on average. The stock has gained around 39% over the past year.POSCO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for POSCO’s current-year earnings has been revised 12.8% upward over the last 60 days. PKX shares have surged around 162% over the past year.L.B. Foster carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 112.5% for the current year.

(NYSE:TMO) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/90-ownership-thermo-fisher-scientific-110046944.html,1695294046,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Thermo Fisher Scientific implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 90% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Thermo Fisher Scientific, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Thermo Fisher Scientific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Thermo Fisher Scientific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.9% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$285m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How Much Debt Does Edwards Lifesciences Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Edwards Lifesciences had US$596.7m in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. But on the other hand it also has US$1.51b in cash, leading to a US$912.6m net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Edwards Lifesciences' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Edwards Lifesciences had liabilities of US$1.16b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$1.40b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.51b and US$816.9m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$231.3m.This state of affairs indicates that Edwards Lifesciences' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$43.7b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Edwards Lifesciences also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesBut the other side of the story is that Edwards Lifesciences saw its EBIT decline by 2.3% over the last year. That sort of decline, if sustained, will obviously make debt harder to handle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Edwards Lifesciences's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Edwards Lifesciences may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Edwards Lifesciences produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 62% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about Edwards Lifesciences's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$912.6m. So is Edwards Lifesciences's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Edwards Lifesciences insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

At present, the CME FedWatch is showing that market participants are almost certain that the central bank will keep the Fed fund rate at the existing range of 5.25-5.5% with an assigned probability of 98%. The CME FedWatch is also showing that there exists just 28% chance that interest rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points in the November FOMC meeting.Despite these positives, investors remained concerned about the Fed’s future course of actions in the past one and a half months. Volatility returned to Wall Street in early August after an impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. In this regard, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized word-by-word to find out the future course of the Fed’s monetary policies.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks (components of the Dow 30) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position, and globally acclaimed brand value. Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers, which will act as an income stream during market’s downturn.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five blue-chip stocks with strong upside potential for the rest of 2023.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. CAT has a current dividend yield of 1.85%.International Business Machines Corp. IBM is witnessing sales growth in the software segment driven by healthy hybrid cloud adoption and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security. A strong foundation of research and innovation, a broad portfolio that caters to various industry requirements and a diverse global market presence set IBM apart from its competitors.IBM is also poised to benefit from the Watsonx platform.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $78.56 billion, indicating growth of 9% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this Issaquah, WA-based company is anticipated to have improved year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share has declined by a penny to $4.71 over the past 30 days, the figure still suggests an increase of 12.1% from the year-ago period.Costco has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.8%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%.Key Factors to NoteCostco’s growth strategies, better price management and decent membership trends have been contributing to its performance. The company’s strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped attract customers who have been seeking both value and convenience. These factors, complemented by reduced supply-chain costs and an increasing penetration of private-label brands, are expected to have a positive impact on the overall results.For the quarter in focus, we anticipate an impressive 7.9% jump in net sales and a notable 6.1% increase in total membership fees. Costco's paid membership base has been on a steady ascent, driven by a growing customer base and remarkable renewal rates. We also project 0.7% growth in comparable sales for the fourth quarter.However, it is essential to acknowledge the presence of certain headwinds, including inflationary pressures and a high-interest-rate environment, which may pose challenges. Additionally, margins remain a critical area to monitor, with potential concerns stemming from any deleverage in the SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses.

Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG recently agreed to acquire the subsidiary of Eastern Bank, Eastern Insurance Group, LLC. Pending regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023.Natick, MA-based Eastern Insurance is one of the largest independent insurance agencies in New England, where it has exhibited steady organic growth. The company offers comprehensive commercial property, casualty and personal lines products as well as employee benefits consulting to clients throughout the northeast U.S. region. For the trailing 12 months ended Jun 30, 2023, the company’s pro forma revenues were around $104 million and EBITDAC was nearly $37 million.With this acquisition, Arthur J. Gallagher will leverage the expertise of Eastern Insurance in retail, construction, real estate and hospitality, and enhance the value of AJG and significantly expand its capabilities in the region.Inorganic Growth StoryArthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with buyouts made in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 25 entities in the first half of 2023, which contributed about $418 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $300 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenues.A solid capital position supports this insurance broker in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. The company expects an M&amp;A capacity of more than $3 billion through the end of 2023 and another $3 billion in 2024 without using any equity.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker’s long-term growth strategies should help it deliver organic revenue improvement and pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. AJG is focused on productivity improvements and quality enhancements that should help it post sturdy numbers in the future.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 35.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 24.1% increase. The efforts to ramp up its growth profile and capital position should continue to drive the share price higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother Acquisition in the Same SpaceGiven the insurance industry’s adequate capital level, players like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions. Recently, Marsh, MMC’s business unit, inked a deal to purchase the entire outstanding share capital of the Australia-based specialist insurance broker, Honan Insurance Group Pty Ltd. Management of Marsh believes that the inclusion of Honan’s well-established capabilities, specifically in the field of corporate risk and strata insurance, will enhance its specialist competence. This, in turn, will enable Marsh to better serve its client base across Australia and New Zealand.Acquisitions form one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Buyouts, similar to the latest one, add strength to its capabilities, expand its services offerings and enable the company to enter new geographies and solidify its foothold across existing markets. An upgraded services suite is likely to lure more customers and contribute more to MMC’s revenues in the days ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Brokerage Insurance space are Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

It reported last week that the attack was detected Sept. 10.Rival casino owner Caesars Entertainment also disclosed last week to federal regulators that it was hit by a cyberattack Sept. 7. It said that its casino and online operations were not disrupted but it could not guarantee that personal information about tens of millions of customers, including driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers of loyalty rewards members, had not been compromised.Caesars, based in Reno, is widely reported to have paid $15 million of a $30 million ransom sought by a group called Scattered Spider for a promise to secure the data.Details about the extent of the MGM breach were not immediately disclosed, including the kind of information that may have been compromised and how much it cost the company.Gregory Moody, professor and director of the cybersecurity program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, pointed to quoted estimates that the computer shutdown cost the company up to $8 million per day, which could put the cumulative effect at $80 million. But Moody also noted that MGM Resorts reports annual revenues above $14 billion, which would mean it averages at least $270 million in revenues per week.The company reported Wednesday that systems handling resort services, dining, entertainment, pools and spas were operational and its website and app were taking dining and spa reservations while the company worked to restore hotel booking and loyalty reward functions.""MGM Resorts properties in Las Vegas and throughout the country are back to normal operations,"" spokesman Brian Ahern told The Associated Press. MGM also has properties in Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.Story continuesFBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault in Las Vegas declined to comment and referred to a previous statement by the agency saying an investigation was ongoing.Experts said the attacks exposed critical cybersecurity weaknesses at MGM and Caesars and shattered an image of casino invulnerability.“At this point, all casinos should be moving to the highest defensive posture possible and taking active measures to verify the integrity of their systems and environment, and reviewing — if not activating — their incident response processes,” said Christopher Budd, a director of threat research at cybersecurity firm Sophos X-Ops. “There’s been attacks against multiple casinos, and it’s possible we’ll see more.”Caesars Entertainment is the largest casino owner in the world, with more than 65 million rewards members and properties in 18 states and Canada under the Caesars, Harrah’s, Horseshoe and Eldorado brands. It also has mobile and online operations and sports betting.MGM Resorts is the largest private employer in Nevada, operating tens of thousands of hotel rooms in Las Vegas at its flagship MGM Grand and properties including Bellagio, Aria, New York-New York and Mandalay Bay. It also operates resorts in China and Macau. It employees 75,000 people in the U.S. and abroad.Caesars stock traded Wednesday at $50.17 per share, up 36 cents for the day. MGM shares were at $38.77, down 43 cents. Both companies are expected to disclose effects of the attacks in quarterly reports next month to the Securities and Exchange Commission.The attack on MGM also has been attributed to Scattered Spider, a group of English-speakers also sometimes known as Øktapus operating under a Russia-based operation called ALPHV or BlackCat.“But there are a lot of conflicting reports,” said David Richardson, an executive at cybersecurity firm Lookout. “You have Scattered Spider claiming that they’ve done both in various forums, and ALPHV, saying that Scattered Spider wasn’t involved with the other. But there’s a lot of technical evidence that shows that there’s a relationship between the two.""Lisa Plaggemier, executive director at the nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance, called MGM’s decision to shut down vulnerable systems to prevent intrusion a positive step but said it highlighted “significant"" security gaps and an urgent need for substantial investment in employee training and cybersecurity. The risk, she said, is ”downtime and financial losses.""“Caesars Entertainment’s decision to pay the ransom highlighted a lack of confidence and investment in their cyber defenses,” Plaggemier said.Moody, at UNLV, said via email that the attacks showed that even for well-prepared or technically advanced companies, “it is not a matter of if you get attacked, but when you get attacked.”“Any target can be breached, as defense cannot win 100% of the time,” he said. “It is not that MGM did ‘bad’ or was negligent. If an advanced persistent threat, defined by its heightened skills, resources and time, targets you, they will find a way to access what they should not.”___Associated Press writer Rio Yamat contributed to this report.]"

Positive trends in Macau's gaming earnings are contributing to the sector's growth. Moreover, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry.The gaming industry in the United States continues to perform better than expected. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $60.42 billion in 2022. In 2022, sports betting increased 72.7% year over year. In the first and second quarter of 2023, the U.S. commercial gaming revenues reached $16.6 and $16.07 billion. This marks the industry’s 10th straight record-breaking quarter. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve.In August, Macau’s gross gaming revenues (GGR) jumped 686.4% year over year to MOP$17.21 billion ($2.12 billion). For the first eight months of 2023, GGR is up 295.1% year over year. Robust investment will continue to aid the gaming industry in Macau. In the next 10 years, six casino companies will invest nearly $15 billion.In line with the industry’s growth, leading gaming companies — Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS and MGM Resorts International MGM — are trying out different strategies to generate profits. With both the companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s analyze and find out which is poised better on the basis of different parameters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance and ValuationShares of Las Vegas Sands have gained 32.8% in the past year, while the same for MGM Resorts have appreciated 19.6%.   On the basis of the forward 12-month P/E ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing gaming stocks, the industry is currently trading at 10.00X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.07X. MGM Resorts has an edge with a lower forward 12-month P/E ratio of 3.9X compared with Las Vegas Sands’ figure of 10.52X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimated Earnings &amp; RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, Las Vegas Sands’ earnings per share are expected to increase 255% year over year. Notably, sales for the current year are expected to improve 146.8% year over year. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts’ current-year earnings per share are likely to decline 30.1% year over year. The company’s sales are likely to improve 19.4% year over year. Thus, this round goes to Las Vegas Sands.Story continuesFundamentalsLas Vegas Sands witnessed impressive recovery in Macao in the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the company reported significant growth in property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy in the Macao region. Visitation in China (excluding Guangdong province) reached approximately 51% of the 2019 visitation level in the quarter.LVS also observed splendid travel and tourism recovery in Singapore. Management’s decision to continue investing in the Marina Bay Sands (MBS), Singapore has added to its solid growth. In second-quarter 2023, MBS achieved solid growth in both gaming and non-gaming segments despite the persisting airlift constraints (primarily from China). As per LVS, in the reported quarter, the rolling volumes in Singapore was $6 billion, which is approximately 84% of 2019 levels. Mass gaming win at MBS reached a record value of $580 million (136% of 2019).On the other hand, MGM Resorts, one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry, is well poised to grow on high brand awareness. The company’s superior business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations are the primary growth drivers. In the past few years, the company has taken various initiatives to align every recognized brand into one global entertainment brand.MGM derives a solid share of its revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world. It is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues and junket productivity in Macau and anticipates a positive trend, buoyed by upgrades to main gaming floor products and marketing initiatives. During second-quarter 2023, Macau business reported adjusted property EBITDAR of $209 million, up 21% from the second quarter of 2019 with a 28% margin.Our TakeFundamentals of both the companies are solid. However, Las Vegas Sands is ahead of MGM Resorts in terms of earnings growth and share price performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 2/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 2/10Momentum rank: 10/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd the GF Score of 57 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings LtdNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Story continuesIs Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0, which positions it worse than 0% of 567 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just -0.21, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.07 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 903.85, which is worse than 100% of 668 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 21.12, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.82% of 585 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -27.2 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 86.18% of 767 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Lastly, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd has a strong brand and a significant market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The Fair Work Commission of Australia, which has the power to impose a settlement, ""strongly recommended"" parties accept its proposals to end work stoppages that began on Sept. 8 at the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG operations. The workers at the facilities, which account for nearly 7% of global LNG supply, are backed by the Offshore Alliance - that combines the Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers' Union. Chevron had been negotiating with the workers for weeks alongside Australia's Woodside Energy, which managed to avert the strikes last month after reaching a deal. Here is a sequence of events leading up to the strike action: Date Development Aug. 9 Workers at Woodside's liquefied LNG facilities in Australia vote for industrial action. Aug. 10 Chevron and Woodside say they are holding talks with union to avert any potential action by the workers. Aug. 11 Australia's labor regulator, the Fair Work Commission, allows workers' union to hold a ballot of employees to decide if they wanted to make a decision on taking industrial action at Chevron's Gorgon and downstream Wheatstone LNG facilities. Aug. 15 Negotiations between Chevron, Woodside Energy Group and Australian unions continue but a source with knowledge of the matter tells Reuters that the talks are unlikely to yield results for days. Aug. 16 Woodside says ""positive progress"" was being made on talks with a union alliance on disputes over the wages of workers. Aug. 16 The Offshore Alliance says during the negotiations Woodside was ""well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration."" Aug. 18 Voting opens in Chevron's facilities to let workers decide if they want to strike due to disputes over wages and working conditions. Aug. 20 Unions at Woodside's North West Shelf offshore gas platforms announce plans to strike as early as Sept. 2. Aug. 22 Woodside CEO Meg O'Neil says the company has had ""constructively addressed"" several concerns of workers but said it also has a duty to shareholders to be able to run the business. Aug. 23 Woodside and unions meet for another round of talks to avoid the strikes. Aug. 23 Chevron's Australian unit says it would increase domestic gas production capacity at its Wheatstone facility. Aug. 24 Woodside reaches an in-principle agreement with unions to avert strikes. Aug. 24 Workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities vote to allow unions to call for a strike if necessary. Aug. 25 Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia warn that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions in exports if workers' demands on wages and conditions were not met. Aug. 28 Workers at Chevron's offshore Wheatstone facility grant unions the power to call strikes on their behalf. Aug. 28 Unions representing workers at Chevron's two major Australian LNG complexes say that they will take industrial action from Sept. 7. Aug. 29 Chevron's workers release details of industrial action including potential work stoppages of up to 10 hours. Sept. 1 Chevron workers reject a company pay and conditions offer. Sept. 1 The offshore alliance says no meetings have been scheduled between unions and Chevron. Sept. 4 Mediation talks to avert strikes at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia begin once again. Sept. 5 Chevron workers announce plans for total strikes from Sept. 14 if their demands were not met. Sept. 5 Some employees of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG facility in Australia offer to work during industrial action in a bid to avert domestic supply disruptions, the Offshore alliance says. Sept. 6 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities agree to pause planned strike action for one day until Sept. 8. Sept. 7 Chevron's LNG workers agree to delay the strike until 1 p.m. local time in Perth (0500 GMT) on Sept. 8 from the earlier scheduled start at 6 a.m. in Perth. Sept. 8 Workers at Chevron's LNG project begin strike as talks between the company and the unions fail to yield any results. Sept. 9 Chevron starts withdrawing contractor workers from Gorgon as the strike continues. Sept. 11 Chevron says it sees ""no reasonable prospect of agreement"" with the workers and would apply to the Fair Work Commission for an ""intractable bargaining"" declaration, which, if granted, would end the strike and allow the labor regulator to dictate an agreement. Sept. 12 The office of the labor regulator said it would hold a hearing on Sept. 22 about the dispute, while the unions wanted it to be held at a later date in November. Sept. 14 Union group Offshore Alliance said a turbine tripped at one of Wheatstone's two LNG trains, which convert natural gas into liquid, on the same day strikes escalated. Sept. 15 Workers begin a 24-hour strike at Chevron's LNG plants. Union representative says they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October. Sept. 18 Chevron says full production had resumed on Sept. 17 at its Wheatstone LNG plant after a fault last week cut production by almost a quarter. Sept. 20 Latest round of talks between Chevron and unions at its two LNG facilities in Western Australia ends without a deal. Chevron says it would accept the Sept. 21 terms of a deal brokered by the Fair Work Commission to end the dispute.

A Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, has officially given financial advisors a generative AI assistant.AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, which allows financial advisors quick access to the bank’s database of about 100,000 research reports and documents, was launched on Monday, CNBC reported based on a company memo.I contacted Morgan Stanley and a representative confirmed the tool, built from OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model, is live. Based on materials that Morgan Stanley Wealth Management shared with me, financial advisors use the tool the most for three main buckets of questions:—Research inquiries. A prompt example: “What is the outlook on the Fed rate hike?”—Administrative questions like, “How do I open an IRA for a client?”—Specialized knowledge questions outside the scope of a financial advisor such as “How can I help a client prepare for a marriage?”“AI @ Morgan Stanley is about helping our advisors service their clients more effectively and to deliver differentiated advice,” Jeff McMillan, head of analytics, data and innovation for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday. “In 2023, human engagement remains our most important driver of growth. AI is about helping our advisors do better, not a replacement for them.”Back in March, McMillan said in a LinkedIn post: “Let’s stop trying to compete with AI and use it to deliver better outcomes for all.” He noted the strategy in place around AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant was full speed ahead.When OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst on the scene in November, Wall Street Banks weren’t exactly enthusiastic about the tool, for risk reasons. In early 2023, some were restricting staff from using it.After almost a year into the proliferation of generative AI, and with continual research that shows it will only increase in influence, more big banks are onboard.“Overall, the risks of not embracing generative A.I. far outweigh the risks of engaging with it,” Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser wrote in a LinkedIn post in July. Fraser said Citi’s innovation labs have been working on generative models that power ChatGPT for the past three years. Other big banks like Goldman Sachs are exploring use cases for generative AI, and JPMorgan Chase has plans for investment advice.Story continuesCFOs are preparing for the opportunities and challenges of generative AI. But they’re all about making sure first that there’s an effective use case for it at their companies. As generative AI continues to become even more sophisticated, the realm of possibilities for its use will expand.For example, ChatGPT came up with 200 new product ideas in about 15 minutes, completing the task faster, cheaper, and more efficiently than Wharton MBA students, according to an experiment by Wharton professor Christian Terwiesch.And we’re still in the early innings.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

V recently teamed up with the leading financial messaging services provider, Swift, in a bid to boost connectivity between the partners’ networks and therefore, ease international business-to-business (B2B) payments. For getting access to Swift’s network, messaging services, standards and solutions, Visa will make use of a scalable and safe cloud-based channel, Alliance Cloud.Swift Payment Pre-validation, one of Swift’s capabilities, will pave the way for the prompt scrutiny of Visa B2B Connect payments. This, in turn, detects potential errors before the initiation of payments and thereby, minimizes unwarranted delays. In addition to this, Swift GPI capabilities and tracking data will be made use of by both the networks to ensure enhanced end-to-end speed and transparency of transactions. The resultant benefit of the latest tie-up will be reaped by financial institution clients of both the networks, who will be equipped to provide increased routing choices for their business customers. Therefore, the ulterior motive of the partnership remains to make cross-border money transfers easier, safer and quicker. Infusing the correct standards of security, resiliency, reliability and compliance within the financial infrastructure of the world remains a mutual motive of both Visa and Swift, which will be addressed by the partnership. The latest move bears testament to Visa’s efforts to bolster the offerings suite that its financial institutions clients extend to their corporate customers. Portfolio upgradation often results in attracting new customers and the likewise may happen with Visa. Through the enhancement of global payment processes, Visa seeks to establish a solid footprint in the worldwide cross-border payments market and targets to alleviate some of the intricacies that often crops up in moving money across borders.And a booming digital era compels businesses to transform their business models and increasingly adopt digital means while making international payments. This, in turn, sustains the solid demand for convenient and affordable digital cross-border payment solutions, on which Visa can capitalize on through partnerships similar to the latest one.Story continuesSwift, powered by a superior infrastructure, which seamlessly interconnects geographies, networks and technologies, seems to be the apt partner to complement Visa’s endeavor of upgrading cross-border payments. Swift safely interconnects more than 11,500 institutions spread across 200 plus countries and territories.Shares of Visa have gained 30.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 22.1% growth.

Despite these figures, the company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 0.79, prompting us to question: is FirstEnergy's stock modestly undervalued? This article delves into FirstEnergy's valuation analysis, providing you with insights to make informed investment decisions.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with FE. Click here to check it out. FE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FEFirstEnergy is an investor-owned holding company with 10 regulated distribution utilities across six Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. It also owns and operates one of the nation's largest electric transmission systems. With a current share price of $36.42 and a GF Value of $42.49, FirstEnergy appears to be modestly undervalued. The company has a market cap of $20.90 billion, hinting at a potential investment opportunity.FirstEnergy (FE): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Utilities Sector?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that evaluates a stock's fair trading value. It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow), a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.FirstEnergy's stock appears to be modestly undervalued according to the GF Value. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth. The GF Value chart below provides a visual representation of this analysis.FirstEnergy (FE): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Utilities Sector?For a list of companies that may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk, click here.Financial StrengthAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. FirstEnergy's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.01, which is worse than 95.24% of 483 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This puts FirstEnergy's overall financial strength at 3 out of 10, indicating that it is relatively weak.Story continuesFirstEnergy (FE): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Utilities Sector?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. FirstEnergy has been profitable 8 out of the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 16.04%, which ranks better than 60.48% of 501 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This gives FirstEnergy a profitability rank of 6 out of 10.However, the company's growth is less impressive. It has an average annual revenue growth of 2.3%, which ranks worse than 76.03% of 484 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 2.7%, which ranks worse than 57.11% of 457 companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. For the past 12 months, FirstEnergy's ROIC is 1.55, and its WACC is 5.02, indicating that the company's return on invested capital is lower than its cost of capital.FirstEnergy (FE): A Modestly Undervalued Gem in the Utilities Sector?ConclusionIn conclusion, FirstEnergy's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. However, its financial condition is poor, and its profitability is only fair. Its growth ranks worse than 57.11% of 457 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.

When people flip the switch, they expect the lights to turn on. Indeed, history shows that bad things can happen if nothing happens following the aforementioned process.Another factor that may lift utilities stocks over other asset classes over the long run is the underlying natural monopoly. Legally, nothing really prevents a newcomer from competing against an established utility service. However, due to the myriad regulations along with the steep barriers to entry, would-be rivals don’t even bother.And therefore, this industry also benefits from a captive audience. No matter what happens in the economy, you’ve got to pay your bills. With that, below are undervalued utilities stocks to buy this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFirstEnergy (FE)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comBased in Akron, Ohio, FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) is an electric utility. Per its public profile, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the distribution, transmission, and generation of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Moreover, the corporate umbrella represents one of the largest investor-owned utilities stocks in the U.S., serving six million customers.However, despite its pertinence to communities and their local economies, FE hasn’t had a great performance in the charts. Since the January opener, shares stumbled just under 14%. Nevertheless, this red ink could make FE one of the undervalued utilities stocks to speculate on. For example, FE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 13.47X, below the sector median of 13.9x.As for passive income, First Energy offers a forward yield of 4.31%. Enticingly, this rate is above the average yield for utilities stocks at 3.75%. In closing, analysts peg FE as a moderate buy with a $40.43 average price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comOne of my favorite utilities stocks to discuss, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) doesn’t get much love in this neck of the woods. Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra seems to always find itself raising the ire of its customers. However, that’s also why it’s a great investment. If you want to live in a desirable region of Southern California, you’re going to have to pay up.And you know what? People pay. Yes, we’ve all heard about California’s net migration out of the Golden State. While I wouldn’t call it “fake news,” you must consider the context. While lower-income folks are leaving, higher-income workers are replacing them. By deduction, such a pivot toward quality over raw quantity should help lift Sempra.Trading at only 0.91x tangible book value, SRE happens to be one of the undervalued utilities stocks to buy. Along with that discount, you get a 3.31% forward yield and 19 years of consecutive dividend increases. Finally, SRE is a moderate buy with an $81.95 price target, translating to 14% upside potential.Entergy (ETR)Entergy sign at their headquarters in New OrleansSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn integrated energy company, Entergy (NYSE:ETR) primarily engages in electric power production and retail distribution operations in the Deep South of the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company generates and distributes electric power to three million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. As with many other utilities stocks, though, ETR has struggled this year, losing about 11% since the January opener.In the trailing 365 days, ETR slipped more than 18%. However, for contrarians, Entergy could make an enticing case for undervalued utilities stocks. For instance, ETR trades at a forward earnings multiple of 13.52x. However, the sector median value comes in at 13.9X. Also, the company runs at 5.65x operating cash flow, favorably below 67.43% of its peers.For passive income, Entergy commands a forward yield of 4.41%. Along with this generous yield, the payout ratio – while a bit elevated – is quite reasonable at 59.56%. Lastly, analysts peg ETR as a moderate buy with an average price target of $110.86, implying over 14% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The upside can be linked primarily to record booking levels due to strong maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) and aftermarket activity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are driving this stock’s performance.Flowserve has recorded bookings of more than $1 billion for six consecutive quarters. In second-quarter 2023, its bookings came in at $1.1 billion. Solid booking levels highlight the strength across the company’s end markets. In the second quarter, bookings increased 20% and 12% in general industries and oil and gas markets, respectively. The same increased in the 2-3% range in power and water. FLS’ Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize (3D) strategy also supports its strong booking levels. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and improving supply chains are aiding Flowserve’s margins. In the first six months of 2023, gross margin increased to 30% from 27% in the year-ago period.Following strong second-quarter performance, Flowserve has raised its 2023 guidance. The company expects revenues to increase 16-18% year over year in 2023 compared with 10-12% rise anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $1.85 and $2.00 compared with $1.65-$1.85 anticipated earlier.FLS’ commitment to reward its shareholders also drove its shares.  In the first half of 2023, the company paid dividends of $52.5 million.Will the Trend Continue?Flowserve is expected to continue to thrive on the back of strong MRO and aftermarket activity levels. Signs of uptick in manufacturing activities support the already strong demand across its end market. Cost-control actions are expected to drive the company’s bottom line. FLS expects to achieve run-rate cost savings of $50 million by the end of this year.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderFlowserve currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Graham Corporation GHM currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

This means the annual payment is 2.6% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Ralph Lauren's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 54.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.60 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.5% a year over that time. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Ralph Lauren has impressed us by growing EPS at 26% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like Ralph Lauren's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Ralph Lauren that you should be aware of before investing.

In August 2023, the cost of buying a starter home in the top 50 metros was $1,111 (60.3%) higher than renting in those markets on average.""Rents have registered steady declines for the past four months and, while they remain well above pre-pandemic levels, when you factor in the impact of record-high mortgage rates and high home prices, it's understandable that many would-be homebuyers are choosing to remain on the sidelines,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""The downward trend in rental prices reduces the sense of urgency, giving renters more time to save for a home. In the period ahead as rents soften, we expect more households will remain renters for longer.""August 2023 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change - 4 yearsOverall$1,752-0.6 %23.7 %Studio$1,463-0.2 %18.4 %1-bed$1,634-0.5 %23.6 %2-bed$1,948-0.7 %26.4 %Nationally, rents drop for fourth straight month, while homebuying costs increaseMedian rents for 0-2 bedroom units declined consistently year-over-year for the past four months which, when combined with mortgage rates hovering above 7% and a low enough supply to drive prices up despite subdued demand, tipped the scales further in favor of renting. In August, homeownership costs exceeded renters' monthly costs by nearly $300 compared with the start of the year.August marked the fourth month of year-over-year rent declines in a row for 0-2 bedroom properties, which overall are down -0.6% year-over-year. Rents dropped -0.7% for 2-bedrooms, -0.5% for 1-bedrooms, and -0.2% for studios.Specifically, the median asking rent in the 50 largest metros dipped to $1,752, down $7 from last month and down $25 from the peak in July 2022. However, median rents remain $336 (23.7%) higher than the same time in 2019, prior to the pandemic.In the majority of the largest U.S. metros, though, renting a starter home remains more affordable than buying one. During the past 12 months, with an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumping from 5.22% to 7.07%, the cost to buy a starter home in markets that favor renting climbed at an average rate of 21.4%, increasing from $2,500 to $2,959.Story continuesRenting beats buying in nearly all major metros, and the advantage is increasingIn August, renting was more affordable than buying a starter home in 47 of the 50 largest metros, up from 45 during the same time last year. Declining rents and the increasing costs of buying a home contributed to the jump in savings from renting. While skyrocketing mortgage rates pushed up the cost of taking on a mortgage, climbing home prices expanded the base of mortgages as well, making buying even less affordable compared to renting. The advantage of renting continues to grow in all rent-favoring markets.In the top 10 metros that favor renting over buying, most of which have a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, both the average cost to rent and to buy are higher than the national average. Austin, Texas topped the list of markets that favor renting, where the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $3,946 – 136.3% more than the monthly rent – for a monthly savings of $2,276. Meanwhile, Baltimore and St. Louis flipped from buy-favoring to rent-favoring markets during the past 12 months.In August 2023, the monthly savings in rent-favoring markets were $483 higher compared to the prior year.The median asking rent declined -0.5% year-over-year in rent-favoring markets, a trend significantly different from 12 months ago. In these markets, the monthly cost of buying a starter home in August 2023 was $2,959, which is $1,183 or an average of 64.3% higher than the cost of renting. Comparatively, in August 2022 buying a starter home in rent-favoring markets cost an additional $700 (36.2%) more than renting.San Jose saw the most substantial surge in savings when comparing renting and buying. In August 2023, renting a starter home in San Jose yielded monthly savings of $3,214, a significant increase from the $1,964 saved last year. Indianapolis, however, saw the largest percentage increase in savings from renting. In August 2023, renting a starter home in Indianapolis would save renters $431 compared to buying, ten times the savings seen 12 months ago ($43).In markets favoring buying, the advantage is shrinkingIn August 2023, only three of the top 50 U.S. metros favored buying starter homes rather than renting: Birmingham, Ala., Memphis, Tenn., and Pittsburgh; however, the cost-benefits of buying have decreased since the same time last year.In buy-favoring markets, the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $29 cheaper on average, or -2.1% lower than the cost of renting, a significant decrease from the savings of $192 in the same time last year.In particular, the savings from buying a starter home instead of renting dropped from $434 to $43 in Memphis, $282 to $6 in Birmingham, and $139 to $39 in Pittsburgh over the past 12 months.As the benefit of buying diminishes in these markets, prospective homebuyers will need to consider all trade offs when deciding whether to buy or continue renting. This is particularly important given that today's elevated mortgage rates and still-high home prices pose substantial challenges for would-be buyers.

Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.The monthly cost of buying a home was calculated by averaging the median listing prices of studio, 1-bed, and 2-bed homes, weighted by the number of listings, in each housing market. Monthly buying costs assume a 7% down payment, with a mortgage rate of 7.07%, and include taxes, insurance and HOA fees.With the release of its July rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since July 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

71,24a35b15-0600-4281-8916-96ae1b588872,MSFT,2023-09-21,Apple’s iPhone gaming success faces a big obstacle,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-iphone-gaming-success-faces-a-big-obstacle-171358934.html,1695230038,STORY,"['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'SNEJF', 'SONY', 'NTDOF', 'NTDOY']","[Apple's (AAPL) iPhone is a gaming juggernaut. Games sold through the company’s iOS App Store account for billions in consumer spending. And with its new iPhone 15 Pro line, Apple is looking to expand its video game empire to compete with the likes of Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox, and Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Switch.The company says that’s possible thanks to the new A17 Pro chips powering its iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The chip, Apple says, features a 20% faster graphics processing unit capable of running console quality games. And while Apple has made that claim for years, this appears to be the first time that’s more than hyperbole.Later this year, Capcom will roll out its “Resident Evil Village,” and the remake of “Resident Evil 4,” for the iPhone 15 Pro line, while Kojima Productions says it’s bringing “Death Stranding” to the phones. And next year, Ubisoft will debut its upcoming “Assassin’s Creed Mirage” on the 15 Pro and Pro Max.These aren’t some watered-down versions of those games, either. Apple says iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max run full versions of those titles natively.But Apple’s road to taking on gaming’s big three console makers faces harsh realities, the least of which is whether game developers and publishers will ever get onboard with pumping out high-end console titles for the iPhone.So why is Apple pushing gaming as such a major part of the iPhone 15 Pro lines’ identity? To help boost sales among gamers in important markets like China where mobile gaming is already massive and Apple’s Android-powered rivals rule.Apple is making gaming one of the signature features of the iPhone 15 Pro line. (Apple) (Apple)Developers need to get onboardApple might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think of video games, but the company has made the case that it should be. According to Data.AI, of the $83.1 billion consumers spent on iOS apps in 2022, a whopping $49.3 billion of that was spent on games. That easily eclipses Nintendo’s 2022 full-year sales of $10.8 billion.Story continuesBut the authority those big numbers confer is hollow since most of these games sold last year are nowhere near as graphically intensive as those available on modern consoles like the PlayStation and Xbox. Apple may rack up numbers with Candy Crush, but full-fat console-quality games like “Resident Evil Village” and “Death Stranding"" are not the same.“Now that iPhone can run the games that typically appeal to really serious hardcore gamers, and if iPhone can run those games natively, then there will be a very large audience that are willing to sometimes purchase the game twice; once on PC and console, and then other times on Apple,” Martin Yang, Oppenheimer senior analyst of emerging technologies and services, told Yahoo Finance Live.But Apple will need to get far more developers and publishers to actually build high-end games for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max if it’s going to tackle the likes of the PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.“If you're a developer/publisher, devoting significant resources to making a game work on … the brand new iPhone is very low,” IDC research director of gaming and VR Lewis Ward told Yahoo Finance.According to Wedbush managing director Michael Pachter, if publishers do decide to put out high-end games for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, they’ll likely be remakes of older games or modern games ported over from consoles to the iPhone. In other words, instead of games specifically designed for the smartphone.The iPhone is already a major gaming platform, but console-quality titles would be a whole other level of interactivity. (Apple) (Apple)Apple’s gaming showcase is meant to lure Android consumersSo if getting high-end game developers and publishers to put out titles for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is such a difficult proposition, why is Apple showing off its latest smartphones as portable gaming consoles? It's likely because it could help drive sales among existing Android gamers, especially in Asian markets where mobile gaming is huge.“I think what it really comes down to is that phone sales and there's not any market share gain, it's not going to grow,” Pachter said. “So it just comes down to, can Apple win over some Samsung buyers? And they probably can in Asia.”Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system. And smartphone makers ranging from Samsung to ASUS have been calling out their devices’ gaming capabilities for years. And in China, one of Apple’s most important markets, smartphone gaming is absolutely massive.Putting out the iPhone 15 Pro, and showing off its gaming bona fides, is a way for Apple to better appeal to Android consumers in China.“The most important thing to take away from this is that Apple is trying to make the strongest case they can that gaming will be better on the new phone, because the chipsets are more powerful than the previous version,” Ward said.Now Apple just has to convince gamers that its latest high-end smartphones are every bit the gaming platforms the company claims.

This downturn contrasts with the S&amp;P 500's 18% gain during the same period and has been attributed primarily to a slowdown in sales growth resulting from decreased demand for COVID-19 testing and vaccination, as well as recent opioid-related settlements.The current stock value represents an over 45% undervaluation compared to Walgreens' estimated worth of $32 per share. However, the likelihood of the stock returning to its pre-inflation shock level of over $57 appears slim in the near term.The company's stock performance has been negatively affected by turbulent market conditions that began in 2022, triggered by an inflation shock due to increased money supply in response to pandemic lockdowns. The situation was exacerbated by shipping disruptions and labor shortages, leading to inflation rates crossing 4% by April 2021.In early 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to spikes in energy and food prices, prompting the Federal Reserve to initiate its rate hike process. Inflation levels peaked at 9% by June 2022, a 40-year high, causing the S&amp;P 500 index to drop over 20% from peak levels. The Federal Reserve continued its aggressive rate hikes through July to September 2022, contributing to a sharp decline in the S&amp;P 500, followed by a partial recovery.This period of economic instability had a significant impact on Walgreens' stock performance. This contrasts sharply with its performance during the 2007-2008 financial crisis when it managed to recover post-crisis, rising 56% between March 2009 and January 2010.Despite these challenges, Walgreens saw its revenue grow from $120 billion in FY19 to $133 billion in FY22, partly due to contributions from COVID-19 vaccine and testing. However, the company's operating margin shrank from 5.2% in 2019 to 1.6% in 2022, largely due to opioid-related settlements.Story continuesWalgreens' total debt, including lease obligations, decreased from $40 billion in 2020 to $36 billion in 2022. Its cash and investments remained steady at around $8 billion over the same period, and it generated $4 billion in cash flows from operations in 2023. This suggests that Walgreens is capable of meeting its near-term obligations despite high debt levels.While there are potential risk factors such as unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, weak consumer demand, and high debt levels, Walgreens stock might see some gains once fears of a potential recession subside due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation rates.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study evaluating the use of non-infused biologics in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrated that patients who are adherent to their non-infused RA biologic medication are more likely to have lower medical costs, odds of hospitalization and length of stay (LOS). AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy, a leading specialty and home delivery pharmacy, and Walgreens, one of the largest drug store chains in the U.S., conducted the retrospective cohort study.(PRNewsfoto/AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy)Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, in which the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) most commonly in the joints of the hands, wrists and knees.[1] In affected joint tissue, the lining of the joint becomes inflamed, causing damage which can lead to chronic pain or deformity.The Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) promotes a useful reporting metric of proportion of days covered (PDC) for non-infused biologic medications to treat RA. This metric is known as PDC-RA. The objective of the study was to identify significant associations between this PQA PDC adherence metric and total medical cost, hospitalizations, and LOS for RA patients.For the study, researchers used both the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases, and Supplemental or Coordination of Benefits databases from 2019 - 2020. They examined three types of yearly outcomes derived per patient: summed healthcare costs; any hospitalization within the year; and summed LOS per hospitalization event.Francis Staskon, PhD, principal analyst of Health Analytics, Research &amp; Reporting at Walgreens, and lead author of the study, says the research found that ""adherence to a non-infused RA biologic can lead to lower medical costs, odds of hospitalization, and LOS after controlling for many other influences on these outcomes. In addition, the findings support the PDC-RA methodology presented about calculated adherence rates used for reporting requirements.""Story continuesRenee Baiano, PharmD, CSP, clinical program manager for AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy and an author of the study, says the research findings underscore the importance of patients remaining adherent to their therapy. She also says specialty-trained pharmacists should take a proactive approach to encourage medication adherence.""Identifying barriers to adherence and educating patients on the importance of taking their medication can increase the patient's chance at disease improvement,"" says Dr. Baiano. ""Whether it's helping the patient take their medication the right way or notifying their prescriber about a new adverse event, a specialty pharmacist can play a vital role in helping patients manage their condition.""Researchers presented the above findings Wednesday, September 20, 2023, at the NASP 2023 Annual Meeting &amp; Expo in Grapevine, Texas.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on September 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.28 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paychex?For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Paychex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $0.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.97, delivering a surprise of -1.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Starting on Oct. 1, former Alibaba executive Wei Zhang will take Schultz's spot on Starbucks' board, an appointment seen as reemphasizing the company's commitment to China.That could mean changes to Starbucks' strategy in China, the company's second-biggest market.""Howard Schultz was the mind behind China's special positioning in Starbucks' ecosystem … and the key figure behind substantial Chinese government support on Starbucks expansion plans in China,"" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo wrote in a note following the announcement.Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz (L) and dean of Tsinghua SEM Qian Yingyi pose at Tsinghua University on April 11, 2017, in Beijing, China.

Starbucks recently announced its 20,000th location outside of North America and plans to expand to 9,000 stores in China in the next two years.Starbucks has gone a different route than its restaurant peers, such as KFC and McDonald's, which run franchise models. But now that Schultz — who was largely against franchising — is out, one analyst thinks that could potentially change.With Zhang now on the board, Gargiulo wrote, ""we wonder whether Schultz's departure would open the door for Starbucks' franchising strategy in China, amid lower store profitability and increased competition.""Starbucks' history in ChinaStarbucks opened its first store in Beijing in 1999 and its first Shanghai store in 2000.From the early 2000s to 2017, the coffee giant expanded with licensing agreements with joint venture partners as it looked to grow its presence in China, which at the time was a largely untapped market.In 2017, Starbucks decided to bring its operations completely in-house when it bought the remaining 50% share of its East China business from joint venture partners for $1.3 billion. Since then, Starbucks has been ramping up its presence with stores directly owned and operated by the company.Story continues""They saw the strong profitability of many of their existing units, and it got to the point where Starbucks probably learned enough about the Chinese market ... [that] they felt they didn't need need to have a partnership any longer,"" Georgetown professor Arthur Dong told Yahoo Finance.Starbucks has continued to invest in China and research the demand for coffee in a nation of daily tea drinkers.The company has also built up its manufacturing footprint there. On Tuesday, the company announced the opening of its China Coffee Innovation Park manufacturing facility. The initiative, introduced back in 2020, is the company's largest investment in any manufacturing and distribution center, totaling approximately $220 million.""China's coffee market is still in its early stages, with huge potential to expand the addressable market,"" Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong said during Starbucks 2022 Investor Day. ""Per capita demand for coffee in China will grow further from 12 cups per year to 14 cups by 2025.""An aerial photo shows the Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Industrial Park in Kunshan Development Zone in Suizhou, Jiangsu province, China, Aug. 25, 2023.

Other big coffee players in China now include Beijing-based Luckin Coffee (LKNCY).""I have to give them credit, they are very politically savvy when it comes to entering the Chinese marketplace,"" Dong said. ""Most of their real estate partners are either high-ranking party officials or real estate entities that are in some way tied to the Chinese Communist Party, and some of the leaders.""However, the environment in China looks very different today than it did just five years ago, China Beige Book co-founder and CEO Leland Miller told Yahoo Finance.""It's much more restrictive towards foreign firms ... so the calculus has completely changed in terms of what the long-term trajectory can be,"" Miller said, pointing to geopolitical risk factors, such as worsening US-China tensions.""The opportunities are there, but the challenges have never been appreciated,"" Miller added.Starbucks customers consume coffee at the world's largest Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, China, Aug. 28, 2019.

""We see risk that China headwinds are likely to get stronger rather than weaker.""As Starbucks moves towards that 9,000 store goal using its own capital, Georgetown's Dong said a franchise model would offer ""a lot of positive benefits.""""Wall Street would probably greet that with welcome arms because they see the risk ... that the Chinese economy is in and the longer-term challenges that China is facing,"" Dong said. ""Why commit your own money in such a risky environment, when you can just have local Chinese investors commit their money, and then gain the backing and support of Starbucks?""This concept isn't too far-fetched, Dong explained, given the company's current model of half-licensed, half-owned stores. Globally, Starbucks locations are 51% company-operated and 49% licensed.How would a potential Starbucks franchise work? Dong said it would be similar to peers.Other US-based brands have had a footprint in the Chinese market for years. Yum Brands (YUM) opened its first KFC location there in 1987 and spun off its China business in 2015. McDonald’s (MCD) was one of the first to enter the market in April 1992 and grew its franchises there before selling its China business to a state-owned conglomerate, Citic and Carlyle Group, in 2017. Additionally, Shake Shack (SHAK) has licensed stores to global partners in Asia.Starbucks would pick and choose which stores it owns, Dong suggested, keeping ""the most prime"" stores in first-tier cities that ""contain large numbers of middle class with an income to buy a $5 latte"" while expanding franchise or licensed stores in ""second- and third-tier cities, where they wish to expand.""Still, Starbucks has a different model than others because it doesn't derive a significant portion of revenue from commercial real estate, Dong explained. That's unlike McDonald's, which had to pivot in China since it couldn't acquire land there permanently.""Starbucks has never been a real estate-centered business model,"" Dong said. ""They engage in leases with a variety of landlords, but they make most of their money to the sale of coffee and ... through the sale of food and beverage.""However, the uncertain environment could be a red flag for investors.""Things are perhaps gonna get worse before they get better,"" Dong said, adding that there will be continued challenges in the next 12 to 24 months, ""until some massive measure is taken by Beijing and Xi Jinping, to sort of kickstart their economy"" and ""the Chinese consumer feels comfortable enough to come out again and spend.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

For income investors, it means a monthly or quarterly raise. For investors who are also concerned with growth, such dividend hikes can portend an increase in future earnings. A dividend increase often indicates that the company's board of directors has faith that future earnings can cover the dividend hike comfortably. In addition, a dividend increase often makes the stock more attractive to investors. Share price appreciation often follows dividend increases.Take a look at three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that announced dividend hikes this week.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

The annual dividend of $4.28 yields 6.71% and the forward funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio is 81.2%.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Airline Stocks to Buy Now.Air travel industry is in recovery mode with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening of the global economy. Unlike in the past three years, there has been a shift with most travelers opting for international travel, something that is helping airlines draw in big revenues from air travel fees and ticket sales.The pandemic brought many challenges as the travel industry came to a standstill. Many airlines plunged into debt and lost a combined $200 billion between 2020 and 2022. It’s only now that most are slowly returning to profitability as they salivate to serve travel-deprived consumers with the easing of travel restrictions worldwide.Major airlines led by United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines continue to rake in huge profits owing to passengers’ willingness to pay higher fares supported by increasing travel demand. The airlines have also benefited from a shortage of airplanes and pilots, allowing them to charge a premium on travel fees without much resentment. Nevertheless, the increase in consumer spending on travel and entertainment remains one of the biggest catalysts for the airline industry.The average cost of flying in the US has increased significantly to historic highs in the industry, bouncing back from the pandemic turmoil. The consumer price index for airline tickets is already up by more than 20% for the year, representing the largest jump since the Federal Reserve started racking the index.Executives from the major airlines expect air travel fares to continue increasing in response to the high demand amid a shortage of planes. Similarly, the executive expects demand for air travel to surge despite the ever-growing risk of recession.Despite the high cost of traveling amid the high inflation and interest rate environment, people continue to make travel arrangements. A Bank of America study showed that spending at airlines and travel agencies is already by more than 60% for the year as more people continue to make travel arrangements.Story continuesNearly two out of every adults plan to take a vacation before year-end, with most shrugging off the rising prices and interest rates.“This year, as prices and interest rates continue to push higher, we’re seeing more signals that vacationers are adapting their plans. Many are still going somewhere, but they’re being more thoughtful about how they’re spending,” said Ted Rossman Bankrate, senior industry analyst The surge in air travel fares has to do with many carriers needing to improve in rebuilding their pre-pandemic flight schedules. A global shortage of aircraft has seen a reduction in aircraft in the tarmacs needed to address the influx of air travel demand. A restricted supply of seats amid high demand is expected to support prices that should allow airlines to continue generating more revenues.On the other hand, the biggest risk to the airline industry is the rising cost of jet fuel. Energy prices have increased significantly in recent months, with crude oil rallying to ten-month highs of $90 a barrel. The increasing energy costs are likely to trigger higher inflation, something that could affect consumer purchasing power, prompting most of them to shelve their travel plans.Nevertheless, the increase in international travel costs due to higher jet fuel could take a toll on the sector that is still in recovery mode from the COVID-19 triggered slowdown. According to Peter McNally of Third Bridge Global Sector lead for Industrials Materials and Energy, airplane capacity issues could become rampant as travel costs soar due to higher jet fuel costs.Some airlines have already started cutting guidance due to the higher fuel costs. For instance, American Airlines expects its Q3 earnings to range between $0.20 and $0.30 a share below the previous guidance of between $0.85 and $0.95. Amid the cuts, most airlines are expected to pass the elevated costs due to high fuel costs, labor issues, and strong dollar to customers owing to the high demand in the market.Waning travel demand is another issue that could batter the sector heading into year-end. Southwest Airlines has already embarked on aggressive marketing campaigns as it looks to get more people booking for its flights.The airline offers triple Companion Pass qualifying points per flight for people looking through its business channels. The easier way to earn the points signifies the ever-growing need to fill seats not just this year but into 2024.11 Best Airline Stocks to Invest In Right NowSource:pixabayDespite the concerns, the air travel industry remains on course to finish the year on a high as airlines continue charging premium fares. As the air travel industry continues to rebound from the pandemic slowdown and airlines report record revenues and profits, tremendous investment opportunities continue cropping up, with most airline stocks trading at highly discounted levels.The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which offers exposure to passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators, is flat for the year, signaling how investors have shunned the sector despite the solid fundamentals.Morningstar expects the operating environment in the US airline sector to continue improving and return to more normalized competitive dynamics once supply constraints moderate. Declining fuel costs in a consolidated industry and robust demand for air travel should offer the much-needed support.Our MethodologyWhile relentless travel demand has sent bookings in major US carriers soaring and leading to bumper earnings, the same is yet to reflect in stock valuations. Most stocks appear to be trading at great discounts, therefore offering a high-risk reward opportunity. We have combined the best airline stocks to invest in, as listed in the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), based on their underlying fundamentals.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors Co. GM, Ford Motor Co. F and Stellantis N.V. STLA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Futu Holdings Limited is a Chinese financial technology (fintech) company that primarily operates in the online brokerage and wealth management industry. Futu Holdings has five main segments, including:Online Brokerage ServicesFUTU allows clients to trade various financial assets including stocks, options, and other securities.Wealth managementThe company offers research reports, portfolio management options, and advisory services to help users make informed investment decisions.Mobile Apps FUTU clients can conveniently trade Through the ""Futu NiuNiu"" and ""Futubull"" mobile appsInternational Brokerage Futu allows its Chinese customers to diversify to global markets.Thriving Despite China's Economic WoesIf you have been paying attention to global markets, it's no secret that the Chinese economy is struggling. Over the past five years, the Chinese government caused uncertainty and turmoil in its economy by cracking down on big tech stocks and employing strict ""zero COVID"" lockdown policies, which crushed the economy. To make matters worse, exports have slowed dramatically while an overbuild of infrastructure has caused a massive housing bubble. With more than half of Chinese household wealth stuck in real estate, the collapsed housing market has caused an economic meltdown to spread through the Chinese economy like wildfire. Unfortunately, for investors, equities markets have not escaped. In fact, the iShares China ETF, a proxy for large-cap Chinese equities, is still well off of its climactic highs from late 2007!Story continuesWith the nasty economic backdrop, most investors would likely expect a company like Futu to underperform. However, the company is firing on all cylinders. Despite a weak equity market, FUTU's quarterly EPS has grown consistently.Looking ahead, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that earnings will grow at a healthy 39.08% clip for full-year 2023.Bullish Chart PatternFutu's price and volume action aligns with its strong fundamental foundation. The stock is drastically outperforming the Chinese equity market and is carving out a bullish cup with handle base structure on the weekly chart.Finding Opportunity Amidst CrisisWhen it comes to investing, crisis often equates to opportunity. Though struggles remain in Chinese equities, investors may want to consider FUTU because it provides international diversification, a contrarian investment, and large reversion to the mean potential.Bear of the Day:Based in Dallas, TX, Southwest Airlines is a low-cost airline provider mainly servicing the United States and ""ten near-international"" markets. Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company's point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United Airlines.What is Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong directionIn Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned has seen three straight quarters of negative EPS growth. Operational DisruptionsMassive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest's operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In Fighting &amp; Bad PublicitySouthwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon. Southwest pilots and employees are seeing little progress in trying to reach a new contract deal. If a strike is to take place, it will lead to even higher costs – especially since competitors like United and American Airlineshave already reached deals with their respective unions.Margins are Being SqueezedRising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest's financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV's return-on-equity of 5.81% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index's 26.2%.Relative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 15.90%, while Southwest is down 14.1%Negative Earnings ESP Score Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) measures the chances a company will beat or miss on earnings. LUV has the unfortunate mix of a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a negative ESP – suggesting the company is likely to miss earnings when it reports October 26th.ConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with. Furthermore, the price action is disheartening when compared to the market and the airline group.Additional content:""Detroit 3"" Auto Stocks Slide as UAW Strike ContinuesThe United Auto Workers' (""UAW"") strike continues to make headlines as the impasse enters its fourth day. This coordinated strike, a historic event with the union simultaneously striking against the Big Three automakers, General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis N.V., comes at a time when labor unions in the United States are experiencing increased approval among the public, notwithstanding declining membership in recent years.Around 12,700 UAW workers have taken part in the strike and have targeted three plants — GM's Wentzville, MO, plant, Stellantis' Toledo Assembly and Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne. The number of people participating in the strike is less than 10% of the total UAW membership, but in choosing these strategic plants, UAW president Shawn Fain has insisted that they are going to hit where they ""need to hit"".Support has also come in from the upper echelons of the government, with no less than President Biden supporting what he sees as the UAW's effort to secure fair wages for the workers. Insisting that the industry needed labor agreements for the future, Biden has also sent senior government personnel to act as a negotiator between the striking labor force and the Big Three.There has been some headway made with Stellantis, which has improved its offer to the UAW over the weekend in the order of an immediate 10% increase in pay and a 21% wage increase over the course of the contract. Ford and General Motors, however, have remained unrelenting and insisted that the strike would push them to lay off workers in the upcoming week. It remains to be seen whether further inroads are made as talks continue.While Stellantis and Ford have been having a good year, with stock prices increasing 45.5% and 15.4%, respectively, General Motors has remained flat, falling a mere 0.1%. However, Ford, GM and Stellantis fell 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, on Monday, as it became clear that the strike will be a longer ordeal than previously thought. This rot might continue.All three stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:PM) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wouldnt-too-quick-buy-philip-101729911.html,1695291449,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Philip Morris International's shares before the 26th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.08 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Philip Morris International has a trailing yield of 5.3% on the current share price of $97.71. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Last year, Philip Morris International paid out 98% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 106% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.Story continuesCash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Philip Morris International's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Philip Morris International, with earnings per share up 5.9% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing comfortably, although unfortunately the company is paying out more of its profits than we're comfortable with over the long term.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Philip Morris International has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.3% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Philip Morris International for the upcoming dividend? Philip Morris International is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both earnings and cash flow as dividends, although at least earnings per share are growing somewhat. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.With that being said, if you're still considering Philip Morris International as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Philip Morris International and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) announced today that the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has verified its Forest, Land, and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions reductions targets. PMI is one of very few companies so far to achieve this recognition.Land use and agricultural sectors offer vast opportunities for GHG removals, including agroforestry, soil carbon sequestration, and forest restoration, for example. Adopting a science-based target for Forest, Land, and Agriculture will support PMI to further accelerate its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions arising from land use.According to the Science Based Targets initiative, ""SBTi’s FLAG guidance provides the world’s first standard method for companies in land-intensive sectors to set science-based targets that include land-based emission reductions and removals. The guidance enables companies to reduce the 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use.""PMI maintains its science-based target to reach net-zero emissions for scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2040, which was validated by SBTi in July 2022. As part of its ongoing net-zero commitment, PMI has now pledged to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions related to forestry, land, and agriculture (FLAG) by 33.3% by 2030 in line with SBTi best practice. PMI aspires to reducing all other scope 3 emissions by 27.5% within the same timeframe. PMI’s 2040 net-zero target remains in line with a 1.5-degree scenario, aligned with leading edge target-setters across business industries. PMI outlines comprehensive plans to achieving net-zero by 2040 in its Low-Carbon Transition Plan.""We renew and continue our effort to direct our activities toward decarbonizing our value chain and are committed to aligning our work with relevant updates on international methodologies, such as the Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) and guidance from the SBTi on forest, land, and agriculture (FLAG) science-based targets,"" said Scott Coutts, Senior Vice President of Operations at PMI.Story continues""The SBTi’s science-based targets on forestry, land use, and agriculture will become the gold standard for companies within the agricultural sector to accelerate emissions reductions, and we are pleased to be early adopters,"" said Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer at PMI. ""The SBTi’s validation demonstrates that our targets are rooted in science and aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal to keep global warming to the 1.5°C threshold that is considered the limit beyond which climate-related impacts will be catastrophic.""Ahead of the validation, PMI was included in Forbes’ first-ever Net Zero Leaders ranking,1 which highlights the 100 U.S. public companies that are best positioning themselves to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions and ultimately offset them by 2050. On the inaugural ranking, which considered initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from the company’s own operations and that of its suppliers, vendors, and customers, PMI ranked seventh overall, and first within its peer group. The ranking also considered the company’s management structure around risk assessment, governance, strategy, and metrics for achieving its decarbonization goals and its financial strength to withstand industry competition and economic turmoil.Read PMI’s Low-Carbon Transition Plan, PMI’s Integrated Report 2022, or visit pmi.com/sustainability to learn more. Additional information about the SBTi and PMI’s approved targets are available at https://sciencebasedtargets.org.Science Based Targets initiativeThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with the latest climate science. It is focused on accelerating companies across the world to halve emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050. The initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match—a leader in oral nicotine delivery—creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4% of PMI’s total 2023 second-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 80 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4% of PMI’s total second-quarter 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

(NYSE:PM), the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is contemplating selling a stake in its largest pharmaceutical unit, Vectura. The company is exploring this move as part of its strategy to find a new partner to help operate and grow Vectura's drug manufacturing outsourcing business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.The tobacco giant is considering different options including a licensing or royalties deal, a commercial partnership, or the sale of either a majority or minority stake in Vectura. However, a spokesperson for Philip Morris declined to comment on the WSJ report.This decision comes two years after Philip Morris acquired UK-based Vectura, which manufactures asthma inhalers, for £1.1 billion (£1 = $1.24). The acquisition was part of the company's long-term strategy to transition into a 'broader healthcare and wellness' company.In 2021, Philip Morris also acquired Fertin Pharma, a nicotine gum manufacturer, and OtiTopic, a respiratory drug development company. These acquisitions were part of a broader plan to pivot away from cigarette sales and enter the market for inhalers and other treatments for respiratory diseases linked to cigarette smoking.The company has been discussing various options with Deutsche Bank to expand its healthcare and wellness division. However, due to issues with the unit, Philip Morris booked a total impairment charge of $680 million (€636.8 million) for the segment in the second quarter of this year and is expected to delay its 2025 target to reach over $1 billion (€940 million) of net revenues.Despite these obstacles, Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer of Philip Morris, reaffirmed the company's commitment to developing its wellness healthcare segment in July. He stated that they aim ""to accelerate Vectura’s growth and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its contract development and manufacturing organization business.""Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The asset managers at Hartford Funds looked at the benchmark S&amp;P 500 going all the way back to 1930 and found there hasn’t been a single decade where dividend stocks didn’t produce positive returns. Even during the so-called “lost decade” of the 2000s when the bursting of the tech stock bubble, 9/11, and the housing market crash resulted in the popular index generating negative returns, dividend stocks still generated a positive 1.8% return.That’s because dividend-paying stocks are typically profitable companies that have been battle-tested in the marketplace. Their investment thesis remains intact despite economic conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet dividend investing is also a delicate balancing act. The higher the yield a dividend pays, the greater the risk tends to be. An investor wants to achieve the greatest yield possible with the lowest risk achievable. Especially with ultra-high yield stocks, investors must do even greater due diligence.What follows are three reliable ultra-high yield stocks that you should be buying hand over fist.Altria (MO) a sign with the Altria (MO) logoSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comIt’s no secret cigarette smoking is in a secular decline. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says adult smokers have declined from 20.9% of the population in 2005 to just 11.5% in 2021. Yet the tobacco industry is hugely profitable and Altria (NYSE:MO) is one of the best-positioned companies to capitalize on the newest trends.As the biggest domestic tobacco stock, Altria’s Marlboro brand of cigarettes also owns the largest slice of the market with a 42% share. It also possesses significant pricing power that it can raise prices almost at will without losing many customers. Adjusted profits grew 4% in the second quarter to $1.31 per share. Net earnings totaled over $2.1 billion for the period.Story continuesElectronic cigarettes are the future for tobacco companies, though. Altria recently completed its acquisition of NJOY, the country’s third-largest e-cig manufacturer. Altria previously had a high-profile flameout with one-time e-cig leader Juul Labs. It lost the nearly $14 billion it invested in the company.NJOY should be able to steal considerable market share from British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) with Altria’s marketing muscle behind it.Altria’s high growth days are certainly behind it, but it has a bright future still in e-cigs and in marijuana. Its investment in Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) has been an impediment but renewed interest in legalization at the federal level could move that business to the forefront.With a better than 50-year record of raising its dividend, management has shareholder interests at heart. It’s one that should keep the dividend yield at 8.7% or better.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMidstream energy stock Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) also has an enviable track record for paying a dividend. The pipeline and storage business has raised its payout every year for a quarter of a century. The dividend yields 7.5% annually.Energy logistics has proved to be a lucrative operation. That’s because as the middle-man between upstream and downstream players, Enterprise Products Partners makes money no matter which way the market for oil and gas goes. Its customers sign long-term, fixed-fee, or take-or-pay contracts, so even if they don ‘t take any product, Enterprise still gets paid.The midstream company is also a reliable dividend stock. Even during the pandemic when oil futures actually went negative, the energy stock still paid its dividend.Without question energy stocks are cyclical. Over the past decade, Enterprise Products Partners’ performance lagged the S&amp;P 500. Yet fossil fuel demand is not abating, making the midstream company’s dividend safe and primed for future increases.Western Union (WU) Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.comJust as the telegram was replaced by faster forms of communication, Western Union (NYSE:WU) faces increased competition in the payments market. Fintech stock apps making consumer-to-consumer (C2C) money transfers a simple process. “Venmo” is almost a verb these days.However, Western Union’s biggest asset is arguably its extensive experience in consumer cross-border and cross-currency transactions. Second quarter results saw a 9% currency-adjusted increase in revenue to $1.2 billion due to strong cross-border transactions. Earnings of $0.51 per share beat analyst estimates of $0.39 per share.President and CEO Devin McGranahan said, “Growth in our C2C transactions was the highest since 2021.” The Western Union brand is still valuable. Users can make payments to more than 200 countries and territories through its app. The company recently sold its business-focused payments business.Western Union’s quarterly dividend had been raised regularly prior to the pandemic, but has been flat since. Yet with a payout ratio of 47%, it is safe and has plenty of room for increases in the future. Yielding 7.4% annually, it will reward investors as the legacy payments company evolves into a modern fintech stock.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MO stock.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH.Industry: Medical - HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2152289/5-hospital-stocks-to-watch-amid-improving-industry-trendsCost optimization and technological innovation are aiding the Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players. Their margins are further propelled by easing staffing challenges. Improving market conditions as seniors are now undergoing delayed elective procedures are boosting patient days and occupancies, which, in turn, is aiding hospitals' top line. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme.Technological implementations are expected to offer companies a competitive edge with improved efficiency. Industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corp., Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. and Community Health Systems, Inc. are expected to benefit from these developments.Industry Overview The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends Defining the Hospital Industry's FutureCost Optimization: The rising patient volumes, prices of hospital supplies and inflationary pressures are likely to increase hospitals' operating costs. The improvement in labor and staffing challenges will continue to provide them some breathing room. These companies are expected to increase labor productivity and implement new technologies to optimize expenses. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Technological Advancements: The hospital players are embracing the digital age as technological innovations and wider adoption continue to support growth. This will optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs, increase convenience and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to continue on their growth path.The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis, which will limit patients' waiting time and decrease their treatment costs.Patient Volume Growth: Seniors are now undergoing deferred elective procedures as pandemic-related constraints are fast vanishing. Hence, pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is driving patient volumes. Although inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and similar safety nets can help them navigate through tough times.Rising Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are expected to stimulate constant growth in the senior population. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population.According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, the percentage of this segment is likely to reach 22% by 2050 from 16.9% witnessed in 2020. The change in demographics and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, more people signing up for healthcare plans through the ACA indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy OutlookThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #46, which places it in the top 18% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to buy or watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite, as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this period, the stocks in this industry have gained 17.7% compared with the S&amp;P 500's rise of 14.5%. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 1.5% during this time.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.67X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.29X and the sector's 9.87X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.55X and as low as 5.57X, with a median of 7.81X.5 Stocks Worth Your AttentionBelow we have presented two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and three stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its telemedicine business line is likely to continue increasing the top line. It is well-poised to grow on the back of expanding patient volumes and growing admissions. Its Managed Medicare and Medicaid operations are expected to benefit top-line growth. HCA's inorganic growth strategy enables it to scale its business. It also focuses on boosting shareholders' value with dividend hikes and repurchases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 EPS indicates 9.2% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 6% increase from a year ago. HCA Healthcare beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 5.4%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have jumped 26.8% over the past year.Tenet Healthcare Corporation: The company provides diversified healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare units. It is witnessing growth in Ambulatory Care and Hospital segments, thanks to rising patient volumes and emergency room visits. Its solid USPI performance is a major contributor to the Ambulatory Care unit. Continuous buyouts and tuck-in acquisitions are aiding the company. It also benefits from contractual rate increases in the Conifer unit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THC's 2023 bottom line is pegged at $5.73 per share, which improved 2.3% over the past 60 days. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 5.8% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 25.9%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 23.2% over the past year.Universal Health Services: The company operates acute care facilities, and outpatient and behavioral health care units. It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma, and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. UHS has been gaining traction from higher patient days and an expansive care network. The rising number of licensed beds in acute care hospitals and joint ventures in the behavioral health portfolio is likely to aid its growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health's 2023 bottom line indicates 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals a 5.9% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 4.7%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Shares of the company have gained 32.6% in the past year.Acadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Improving patient volumes, admissions and extension of its service lines into new states are aiding the company's performance. It is on track to add 300 beds to its existing facilities this year and inaugurate six comprehensive treatment centers. However, rising expenses are keeping its margins under check while high debt remains concerning. Though shares of ACHC have declined 14.8% in the past year, its strong operations are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC's 2023 bottom line indicates 12.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 10.4% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 2.8%.Community Health Systems:It is a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the United States. Rising patient volumes, admissions and improved occupancy rates are boosting the company's results. Its focus on telehealth is expected to position the company for long-term growth. Community Health also does not shy away from divesting non-core assets to boost profitability, same-store metrics and cash flow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CYH's 2023 bottom line indicates a 55.1% improvement from a year ago. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals 1.7% growth from the prior year. Community Health has witnessed three upward estimate revisions over the past 60 days against two in the opposite direction. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Shares of the company have gained 11.1% in the past year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.94%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.53%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the specialty finance company had gained 7.47% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's gain of 2.54% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.85% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Goldman Sachs BDC as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Goldman Sachs BDC is projected to report earnings of $0.57 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1.79%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $113.62 million, up 19.32% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.18 per share and revenue of $447.16 million. These totals would mark changes of -2.68% and +25.09%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs BDC. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

This move comes after Goldman Sachs struck a deal to sell its Personal Finance Management (PFM) unit to Creative Planning in late August.Yahoo Finance Reporter David Hollerith joins the Live show to break down GreenSky's value since Goldman Sachs acquired it, as investors keep a close watch on CEO David Solomon's position at the company, while explaining developments in broker deposits across U.S. banksFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, more color on Goldman Sachs' awaited sale of specialty lender GreenSky came last night from the ""Wall Street Journal"". Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith to give us those details. Hey, David.DAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, Rachelle. So this is part of Goldman's larger push out of consumer lending, and Goldman has said as far back as its Investor Day in February that it was considering selling GreenSky. Now, from the ""Wall Street Journal"" story that came out last night, it appears that the sale for GreenSky is sort of at its final innings, with the bidding, according to the ""Journal"", including KKR and PIMCO, as well as San Francisco-headquartered Sixth Street, which currently holds the leading bid.Now, the deal is expected to be valued at $500 million, which is approximately 71% less than the %1 billion-- or, excuse me, $1.73 billion that Goldman paid for GreenSky in the first quarter of 2022. So that was an all stock transaction, and the possible sale of GreenSky obviously has been something that is kind of seen as like the biggest step that Goldman needs to take to sort of finish this sort of tricky pull out of consumer lending that it announced as early as the fourth quarter of last year, but this is obviously something that we're paying a lot of attention to.Story continuesLast week at a Barclays conference, CEO David Solomon did not have a ton to add on the GreenSky deal, and he said that the bank would report more once the transaction is closed, but that they have been in the marketing process to sell GreenSky. And obviously, just to hit on the strategy overall, the remaining consumer finance products that Goldman has, they're still trying to bring those to profitability, and since 2020, the bank has lost about $4 billion on consumer lending, or consumer finance products, excuse me, so this is obviously a tricky thing that a lot of investors are waiting to see to be ended.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, David, I know that you've also been paying attention to the deposit story at small banks. Now, they've regained about half of what they lost since SVB failed, but the mix is different. Can you break that down for us?DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, so, you know, a really good thing is that small banks, or those outside of the 25 largest in the country, have regained the most deposits they've had since SVB's collapse, so that's very good, and it's kind of opposite of what we saw in the first quarter and the beginning of the second, which was that it looked like most deposits were sort of fleeing to larger banks in sort of a flight to safety.And now what we've seen is that banks have been paying overall and across the industry more on their rates to depositors to retain customers, and obviously that cuts into profitability. And sort of the most extreme example of this is brokered deposits, and brokered deposits are almost exclusively focused on rate payments for prices. There's a third party that sort of matches rate seeking or a high rate seeking depositor with a bank for a price. So there's not really as much of a relationship built in.And this was addressed by the FDIC's chairman Martin Gruenberg earlier this month, and he did point out that broker deposits do present liquidity risks for banks. It's a lot harder to rely on those funds when a bank might be cash strapped or needing to quickly repay financial obligations. But that being said, brokered deposits do kind of get a bad rap. They're seen as much better than a bank borrowing from the US government in some capacity, and, you know, it really also depends on which bank you're looking at.But the change in the last year has been pretty significant. We've seen about an 86% increase in brokered deposits across the industry. Now, that means that still brokered brokered deposits make up a pretty small amount of total deposits in the banking system, only about 6.5%, but at certain banks, and Martin Gruenberg also pointed this out, it can vary a lot.And, you know, we're looking at certain smaller banks such as Comerica, as well as Western Alliance and Customers Banks all as having, you know, pretty significantly high amounts of brokered deposits. Now, again, this isn't really bad on its surface, but it does pose an issue in terms of liquidity, and it's something we're going to focus on a lot more as these banks try to maintain profitability.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll certainly be keeping track of that. Appreciate you breaking all of that down for us our. Very own David Hollerith. Thank you so much.]"

The banking giant has launched a new division, Sports Franchise in Investment Banking, to offer its wealthy clients avenues to invest in professional sports teams and other entities within the sports and entertainment industry. This initiative is part of a wider industry effort to keep pace with the increasing value of sports franchises.The newly formed division will be led by Goldman Sachs executives Greg Carey and Dave Dase. It aims to focus on the global sports ecosystem, encompassing all major sports, federations, leagues, franchises, and clubs, as well as businesses tied to sports media, entertainment, and technology. This move combines Goldman Sachs' prior engagements in sports mergers and acquisitions with its sports financing operations.The specific teams or assets immediately available for Goldman Sachs clients to invest in have not been revealed yet. However, the banking powerhouse has been part of several significant transactions in the past. These include the sales of Premier League's Chelsea, Formula 1, and a minority stake in NFL's Tennessee Titans.This new venture is expected to provide investors with a more direct path to tap into the rapidly growing interest in sports-related investments. In recent times, franchise values have surged, leading to the consideration of diverse alternative strategies for team ownership and investment. The NFL is reassessing its traditional ownership rules while several other professional leagues have allowed private equity and sovereign wealth funds into ownership.International ownership in sports franchises has also seen an upswing. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has made substantial investments in U.S. sports and beyond.

A lack of pipelines and heavy emissions have weighed on the Canadian heavy crude sector for years, with some companies exiting after coming under pressure to invest in projects with lower emissions. According to research firm Rystad Energy, oil sands production in Alberta generates ~160 pounds of carbon per barrel, the highest of any oilfield in the world.But Alberta’s politicians have no plans to ditch the province’s main cash cow any time soon. Alberta premier Danielle Smith has declared that the energy-rich region will transition away from emissions, not oil.""We're transitioning away from emissions, we're not transitioning away from oil and gas. We're not going to phase out production of oil and natural gas, we're just going to change the way in which we use it,"" Smith has said at the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary, Alberta. According to her,  hydrogen from natural gas will likely become an increasingly important fuel in the province while carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) will play a role in cleaning up emissions. Smith has differed radically with Canada's minister of energy and natural resources Jonathan Wilkinson who the previous day had supported IEA’s prediction that world oil demand will fall to just 25 million barrels per day by 2050, or a quarter of current global demand, an assertion Smith has dismissed as ‘ludicrous’. Wilkinson had argued that oil and gas after 2050 would primarily be used in applications not requiring combustion, such as petrochemicals,  lubricants, solvents, carbon graphite, asphalt and waxes.Alberta To Unveil Carbon Capture Incentive ProgramOn Tuesday, Alberta’s energy minister Brian Jean announced that his office is finalizing an investment incentive program for emissions-cutting technologies like carbon capture and storage to be unveiled in the ""coming months"". Canada considers CCUS a key tool in helping the country’s high-polluting oil and gas industry slash emissions without cutting back on production. However, Canadian companies have been holding back on final investment decisions mainly because of the high costs associated with carbon capture and have been lobbying for more government support.Story continuesRelated: California Truckers Race To Buy Diesel Rigs Ahead Of New Zero-Emission RuleAn Alberta incentive program, working alongside a federal government investment tax credit first announced last year, would be pivotal in jumpstarting Canada\s nascent CCUS sector.""We're going to make sure we do a robust consultation to get it right. If we get it right, that means that we're going to see another economic boom here in Alberta,"" Jean told Reuters in an interview.Canada has set a net-zero emissions by 2050. A number of companies including Enbridge Inc.(NYSE:ENB), TC Energy Corp. (NYSE:TRP) as well as a coalition of Canada's six largest oil sands producers called Pathways Alliance have proposed building major CCS storage hubs.But their American peers are considerably ahead of them.Back in February,  oil field services giant Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE:SLB) SLB discussed its newly carved SLB New Energy unit with Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). The segment will invest in hydrogen, carbon solutions, energy storage, geothermal and geo-energy and critical minerals. According to SLB New Energy president Gavin Rennick, the new unit has the potential to hit revenue of $3 billion by the end of the current decade and at least $10 billion by the end of the next decade.Back in April, Exxon CEO Darren Woods told investors that the company’s low-carbon business has the potential to outperform its legacy oil and gas business within a decade and generate hundreds of billions in revenues. According to Woods, the business has the potential to hit hundreds of billions after the initial 10-year ramp-up. However, whether Exxon is able to actualize its dream will depend on regulatory and policy support for carbon pricing, as well as the cost to abate greenhouse gas emissions, among other changes, Ammann said.Exxon believes that the Low Carbon segment will be ""much more stable, or less cyclical"" and also less prone to commodity price swings through predictable, long-term contracts with customers aiming to lower their own carbon footprint. For instance, Exxon recently signed a long-term contract with industrial gas company Linde Plc. (NYSE:LIN) that involves the offtake of carbon dioxide associated with Linde’s planned clean hydrogen project in Beaumont, Texas.  Exxon will transport and permanently store 2.2M metric tons/year of carbon dioxide each year from Linde’s plant. Linde has unveiled plans to build a $1.8B complex which will include autothermal reforming with carbon capture and a large air separation plant to supply clean hydrogen and nitrogen.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Chinese Fuel Oil Imports Continue To Dip From Decade-HighIndia And U.S. Strengthen Energy TiesThe Trader That Sparked A Surge In U.S. Oil PricesRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Some of the company’s profit-making solutions include 3D digital mammography systems, image analytics software utilizing artificial intelligence, ultrasound imaging and minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems.The company has been making impressive progress in its Breast Health arm recently, leveraging its strategic expansion efforts to diversify business across the patient continuum of care.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Breast Health arm registered strong growth, primarily driven by increased volumes of digital mammography systems, primarily 3D Dimensions systems and related workstation and workflow products, including software. Further, increased Trident systems unit sales and higher Faxitron breast-conserving surgery products aided growth. The increase in volume was driven by the improvement in supply chain constraints related to electronic components, primarily semiconductor chips.Hologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. PriceHologic, Inc. price | Hologic, Inc. QuoteLately, as the severity of the pandemic is over, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business has been registering strong growth, driven by a combination of newer assays like BV, CV/TV and contributions from Amgen and HSV, as well as strong growth from longstanding women's health menu.Further, the company’s expanded global installed base of Panthers (more than 3,250) is the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of Panther combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates Hologic from competitors.Story continuesOver the past year, shares have risen 11.5% compared with the industry’s 0.4% rise.On the flip side, during the COVID-19 public health emergency, Hologic launched several assays to detect COVID. However, the company is experiencing a continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand and it is expected to worsen in 2023 as customer testing and therapy, and vaccine demand decline.In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, COVID-19 revenues, which consist of COVID-19 assay revenues and other COVID-19 related revenues and revenues from discontinued products, decreased 74.6% or 74.4% in constant currency.We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faces owing to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company’s overall performance in the past few quarters. The company’s international sales are often denominated in foreign currencies, including the euro, UK pound and renminbi. Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the increase in the value of the dollar against any such foreign currencies, may reduce the reported value of Hologic’s revenues and associated cash flows outside the United States.During the nine-month period in fiscal 2023 (ending Jul 1, 2023), the company experienced an adverse impact from foreign currency translation on its Diagnostics, Breast Health and Skeletal Health international sales.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It can seem counterintuitive at first. After all, investors often aim to buy low and sell high. But sometimes, the best prospects lie in a stock that is already making highs and set to keep on climbing.As the physics adage goes, “an object in motion stays in motion”. The same often holds true for momentum stocks with strong fundamentals. The good news is that some momentum stocks, despite their strong rallies, are selling at attractive valuations as well. All three of these following momentum stocks made new 52-week-highs this week and have plenty more gas left in the tank.Toyota Motor (TM)The facade of a Toyota dealershipSource: josefkubesToyota Motor (NYSE:TM) has seen its shares run up to new 2023 highs over the past couple of months. Much of this came after Goldman Sachs called Toyota an “electric vehicle market sleeper” pick in August. The analysis sees Toyota ending up with more than 10% of the total electric vehicle market in 2030.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMost of the excitement in the automotive space is around new electric vehicle makers. And it’s understandable that traders are gravitating to dynamic firms like VinFast Auto (NYSE:VFS) that have come onto the scene with a bang.However, we shouldn’t forget about the legacy automakers either. They have tremendous operational scale, powerful brands, and worldwide reach. In addition, they’ve quietly been making forward-looking investments in electric vehicles and next-generation technologies as well.In the meantime, Toyota is incredibly profitable. TM stock is up 25% over the past year. Even with that rally, shares still sell for less than 10 times forward earnings. With the economy hanging in there, Toyota shares could keep riding higher for quite a while.Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro (OMAB)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro (NASDAQ:OMAB) is a Mexican airport operator focused on properties in the northern part of that country. Its flagship property is the Monterrey, Nuevo Leon airport, which serves an urban area of more than five million people.Story continuesIndustrial activity has exploded in activity in the state of Nuevo Leon since the onset of the pandemic as firms move manufacturing capacity from China to Mexico. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of the latest to set up shop in Mexico, with it announcing plans for a $5 billion manufacturing facility in Monterrey. It’s not just Tesla; we’ve seen tons of announcements from the food &amp; beverage, packaging, steel, and industrial goods sectors around new Monterrey plants recently as well.OMAB stock has been taking flight this year. Its passenger traffic is growing more than 20% year over year (YOY) and revenues even faster. So it comes as no surprise that investors are bidding up this leading Mexican logistics and infrastructure play amid the wave of manufacturing. OMAB stock is up more than 70% over the past year. Even so, with earnings also climbing quickly, shares still go for just a 17x forward P/E ratio.Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPhillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is one of the nation’s largest oil refining and distribution businesses. Formed by a spin-off from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Phillips 66 has blossomed into a large and successful independent enterprise.And, lately, it’s a great time to be a refining company. The U.S. hasn’t built any new, large oil refineries in more than 40 years, with the last unit of significant downstream capacity coming online in 1977. However, as product demand has increased and the U.S. has also produced more oil from fracking, this has led to a favorable supply/demand dynamic and improved profit margins for the refining industry.In 2022, the industry produced windfall profits. Phillips 66 has put up a stunning $23/share in earnings over the past year, leaving at just six times trailing earnings.Analysts had been modeling a sharp drop in earnings going forward thanks to weakening demand and a slowing economy. However, the energy sector is picking up steam once again this fall as it appears prices will stay higher for longer. This could lead Phillips 66 to continue generating strong results. PSX stock is rallying as traders factor in the possibility that the company will continue to produce gushers of income going forward.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in OMAB stock.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 14.83, the question arises: Is the stock fairly valued? This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Amgen's valuation and encourage readers to delve into the following analysis.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMGN. Click here to check it out. AMGN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AMGNAmgen is a renowned leader in biotechnology-based human therapeutics, with a historical expertise in renal disease and cancer supportive-care products. Some of its flagship drugs include Epogen, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta, Enbrel, and Otezla. The company's stock price currently stands at $271.46, which is compared against its GF Value of $263.31.Amgen (AMGN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Given this, Amgen's stock is believed to be fairly valued. This is based on the GF Value estimate that considers historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. Because Amgen is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesAmgen (AMGN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Evaluating Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, an investor must review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are great ways to understand its financial strength. Amgen has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.56, which ranks worse than 59.02% of 1059 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The overall financial strength of Amgen is 5 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Amgen is fair.Amgen (AMGN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Amgen has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $26.60 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $14.83. Its operating margin is 35.72%, which ranks better than 96.75% of 1046 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Overall, the profitability of Amgen is ranked 9 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Amgen is 8.2%, which ranks better than 57.03% of 924 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 2.7%, which ranks worse than 61.91% of 890 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Amgen's ROIC is 18.89 while its WACC came in at 7.07.Amgen (AMGN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn summary, the stock of Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is believed to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 61.91% of 890 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the potential outcome of any litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.  We may not obtain regulatory clearance to acquire Horizon or be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand OaksElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)Jessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media)Justin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)Amgen Logo.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US stock market and recent developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now.The Two-Day Fed MeetingOn September 19, the US Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting, leaving investors in a state of anticipation over what to expect next. Some argue that the Fed is not likely to hike rates again, while others provide an alternative response. Regardless of which camp ends up being right about this matter, it is indisputable that the Fed's September decision will immensely impact the market and those who hold a stake in it, making this a topic of interest for major stakeholders across the country.CNBC's 'Halftime Report' discussed this topic on September 19. Josh Brown, the CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, was among the experts invited on CNBC to comment on the situation on the ground right now. Here's what he had to say:""If we do still have more hurdles, and even possibly more rate hikes, that's gonna come because of what's going on with oil and gasoline prices - my opinion. You do have the stickiness in wages, you may not have the same rate of inflation but wages aren't going back down. You have the same phenomenon in shelter, particularly in rentals. That's not going back down. That stickiness is with us.""Brown continued to discuss how WTI crude oil and gasoline prices are on the rise at the moment. He noted that historically, recessions have almost always been preceded by ""an oil price shock"" or a ""spike."" However, for him, the recent increases in oil prices are not at that level yet - they have merely moved up gradually. And this factor is why Brown does not believe that the Fed is done with its rate hikes just yet.Where Should Investors Put Their Money?Investors should keep in mind that, at the moment, the markets are still in an unpredictable phase. The fact that the Fed's September decision is also just on the horizon means that investors should be extra careful with where they put their money. Karen Firestone, the CEO of Aureus Asset Management and a renowned portfolio manager, made the following comments on CNBC's 'Halftime Report' with regards to portfolio management:Story continues""What I feel is most important is to have a portfolio that encompasses companies that are going to have earnings growth that's greater than expected. You know, we can start seeing some earnings accelerations. And I think this is the first time in quite a long time that estimates are moving higher.""Companies with high earnings growth can thus be good bets for many investors during the second half of the year. However, another cohort of stocks some should look into is that of beaten-down stocks that have recently hit their 52-week lows. If investors can find a few companies that have proven their worth historically in terms of earnings growth and other fundamentals but are struggling in the market at present, they can probably come up with a portfolio of stocks that are reliable for the future and that can be bought at a bargain right now. Some such stocks include Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). There are many others that we have mentioned in our list below as well. These include some of the best stocks to buy now in 2023 and some of the best growth stocks to buy now.13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to find stocks that had hit their 52-week lows around September 18 and then shortlisted 13 stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

The analyst also maintained a price target of $240 on the stock.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”Like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Illumina, Inc.

The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now13 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy Now11 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To ConsiderDisclosure: None. 13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

128,c4c8fa14-8ee2-39be-b9a6-f27da5b75104,NOV,2023-09-21,MORNING BID AMERICAS-Fed leaves shoe dangling in policy parade,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-americas-fed-leaves-100235800.html,1695290555,STORY,['CL=F'],"[A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Mike DolanCentral banks line up across the world on Thursday to deliver updated policy settings but global markets sulked at the Federal Reserve's refusal to sound an all-clear on rate hikes as it left one last move this year on the table on Wednesday.At least eight major central banks are meeting on Thursday.Both Swedish and Norwegian central banks have already announced further rate rises, as expected. Although the Swiss National Bank paused just like the Fed and bolstered liquidity to its banks, it also said more hikes may be necessary.Following Wednesday's surprise drop in British inflation, markets are now split on whether the Bank of England will pull the trigger one last time later today or signal the end of the whole campaign here at a peak rate of 5.25%. Central banks in South Africa and Turkey are also meeting.But, as so often, it's the Fed that casts the biggest shadow.In what many dubbed a 'hawkish pause' in its tightening campaign that drummed home the 'higher for longer' message, the U.S. central bank upgraded its view of growth, jobs and policy rates through 2024 - and a majority of policymakers indicated they still favour one last rate hike this year to 5.5-5.75%.Wall St took it badly and stock futures remain in the red on Thursday. The S&amp;P500 fell almost 1% to its lowest level of a rough September so far, with tech stocks taking the brunt of the selling and the NYFANG index of 10 megacap digital and tech giants off more than 2% - its biggest daily swoon in almost a month.The VIX volatility gauge closed above 15 for the first time this month and climbed further pre-market on Thursday. Asian and European bourses all fell sharply too.The sour mood in equities emanated from a further repricing rates and bond market.Futures now show the implied Fed policy rate for the end of next year at a new cycle high of 4.85% - up a whopping 35 basis points in just over a week. And that's still a quarter point below where Fed policymakers indicated they would be by then - and just 50bp below the 'peak rates' later this year.Story continuesThe reason? Fed officials still don't see inflation back to their 2.0% target until 2026. As the economy dodges recession and unemployment stays low, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed needs 'convincing evidence' its policy stance is bringing inflation back to target.Goldman Sachs said it now expects Fed easing to start as late as the fourth quarter of next year, six months later than an earlier forecast for a first cut in Q2.""(Fed) participants appeared to move away from the view that monetary policy tightening could weigh on growth with a long lag next year, which weakens one argument for cutting,"" wrote Goldman economist Jan Hatzius.Others, such as Institute for International Finance chief economist Robin Brooks, think the Fed is simply trying to prevent bond markets loosening prematurely and running away with the prospect of rate cuts ahead once a peak rate is assumed.""It's just expectations management,"" Brooks said.If so, it appears to be working.The Treasury market - bracing for another heavy diary of new debt sales next week - seemed in no mood to fight the Fed.Two-year Treasury yields topped 5.2% on Thursday for the first time since 2006 - up 32bp this month alone. Ten-year Treasury yields hit 4.5% for the first time in almost 16 years.The only solace was that it knocked back restive crude oil prices even further. US crude futures dropped back below $90 per barrel for the first time in more than a week - down almost 6% from Tuesday's highs.With many of the other central banks hesitating even as the Fed hangs tough over the horizon, the dollar zoomed to six month highs. The SNB's pause and the prospect of the BoE stalling later too meant the Swiss franc and sterling led the way lower against the pumped up buck.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:* Bank of England policy decision; South Africa Reserve Bank policy decision, Central Bank of Turkey policy decision. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks* Philadelphia Fed's September business survey, U.S. weekly jobless claims, U.S. Aug existing home sales, U.S. Q2 current account estimate.

The escalating cost of oil has been a significant contributor to U.S. inflation, directly affecting gasoline prices and consequently driving consumer prices up. Over half of the 0.6% increase in consumer prices recorded in August can be attributed to gasoline, which currently averages at $3.87 per gallon, a roughly 20 cents increase from last year, according to AAA.The rising oil prices have also influenced diesel costs, impacting the price of other goods due to their effect on shipping expenses. This surge in oil prices could potentially push inflation rates higher, leading the Federal Reserve to continue its course of interest rate hikes through 2024. However, some experts anticipate that the inflationary impact of oil will start to diminish towards the end of the year as supply begins to match demand.Despite these trends, Natasha Kaneva, head of the global commodities strategy team at J.P. Morgan, suggests that the recent oil price boom may be nearing its end. After reaching a September target price of $90 per barrel, she expects further increases to be limited as all major market drivers have largely been exhausted for now. Kaneva predicts that oil prices will close out the year at around $86 per barrel.The summer travel rush and China's recovery from COVID-19 restrictions have been significant factors driving up oil prices. However, recent data indicates a slowdown or even reversal in these trends, with high gas prices leading some consumers to reduce their driving habits. Kaneva notes that while there was robust demand at the start of summer in the U.S., this momentum faded in July and August and has remained relatively weak into September.China's growth in demand also appears to be slowing down. Kaneva anticipates an increase of 1 million barrels per day in Chinese demand in the last quarter of the year compared to last year, but she expects it to remain consistent with volumes from the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesAlastair Syme, a Citi analyst, doesn't expect oil prices to significantly drive global inflation in the coming year. He points to data suggesting a potential oversupply in the oil market by 2024, given the need for continued OPEC+ cuts to balance growing non-OPEC supply against sluggish demand. However, he expresses concerns over the impact of natural gas prices on global inflation next year. A particular challenge is the approximately 4% reduction in global gas supply following Russia's cessation of sales to Europe.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The Brent crude oil decreased 1.2% to $92.40 per barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped 1.3% to $88.57 per barrel.This downturn marks the second consecutive day of losses for both Brent and WTI, following a substantial surge in prices over the past weeks. Market analysts have been engaged in discussions over whether this upward trend would persist or if profit-taking actions would put a cap on the rally.The Federal Reserve's decision has heightened the focus of crude oil traders on consolidation. While this move could potentially raise demand concerns for 2024, a statement released by Saxo indicates that market tightness is expected to persist in the near term.With this shift in Federal Reserve policy, it remains unclear how future oil prices will be impacted.

In its projection released on Thursday, the company maintained that oil and gas would continue to fulfill more than half of the world's energy needs.The corporation linked energy demand directly to economic progression. According to Exxon Mobil's forecast, by 2050 an additional 1.5 billion individuals will join the global middle class. This surge in middle-class population is projected to result in increased consumption of commodities such as automobiles, air conditioners, and refrigerators, leading to a corresponding rise in energy demand.Drawing parallels from China's experience where per capita energy usage increased more than fivefold during its economic boom, Exxon Mobil anticipates a similar trend could occur in Africa over the forthcoming decades. The company also predicts a significant 80% growth in global electricity consumption by 2050.Contrary to popular opinion suggesting that Electric Vehicles (EVs) might lead to a peak in oil demand, Exxon Mobil posits that even if every automobile sold from 2035 onwards is an EV, it would only decrease global oil demand to approximately 85 million barrels per day. This level of demand is comparable to that seen in 2010. Therefore, Exxon Mobil insists that all forms of energy, including oil and gas, are necessary to support future growth.In summary, Exxon Mobil's outlook until 2050 indicates an ongoing rise in energy demand with oil and gas maintaining their crucial roles in the global economy.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The total company stock balance across the index is $13 billion, or 14% of $90.4 billion in investments, according to a Reuters analysis of 2022 financial statements.NextEra's strategy, ill advised by financial advisers and out of favor in most corporate 401(k) plans, generates tax deductions for corporate headquarters while workers shoulder all the risk of a concentrated position in a single stock.By contrast, 92% of U.S. employee retirement accounts contain no home-company stock, with many companies either not offering their shares for those plans or limiting them, according to a Vanguard Group study of 2022 allocations by 5 million 401(k) participants.NextEra policies incentivize workers to invest retirement funds in its shares.

Ahead of Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2023, Mastercard surveyed small business owners across Canada who said they struggle to invest in cybersecurity tools that would best protect them due to limited resources and lack the know-how to effectively recover once a cyber attack occurs.1 MasterCard Logo (CNW Group/Mastercard)In our connected world, the value of any business is increasingly tied to data. A cyber breach can cost small businesses money and a loss of trust.Yet, just 16 per cent of Canadian small business owners surveyed feel certain they know the best steps to take following a cyber attack and only 18 per cent are totally confident that their business would recover fully from an attack in the next six months. The reality facing small businesses in today's digital landscape is that cyber attacks are not a matter of if, but when—and what next?""At Mastercard, we go beyond protecting the transaction, by integrating new thinking and approaches into the foundation of our innovative cybersecurity products and solutions to safeguard an evolving ecosystem,"" said Aviva Klein, Vice President, Digital Payments and Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard in Canada. ""Given our global expertise in cyber and intelligence, Mastercard is committed to transferring knowledge to Canadian small businesses – the backbone of Canada's economy - so they can scale cybersecurity capacity, protect their data, and maintain trust with customers—even after a cyber attack occurs.""Expanding Cyber Preparedness and Securing Trust for a More Prosperous FutureMaintaining and rebuilding consumer trust is critical to small business recovery following a breach. According to Mastercard's recent study, data protection measures (57%), accountability (53%) and transparency about past cyber incidents (52%) rate among the highest factors that influence Canadian consumers' perceptions of small business security and trustworthiness. A robust and transparent cybersecurity plan is essential for small businesses to uphold their reputation and maintain long-term resilience, even as cyber threats increase and evolve.Story continuesTo help Canadian small businesses start securing their business, Mastercard and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) have partnered to deliver the Cybersecurity Academy, with short lessons and free tools tailored to the needs of small businesses. Mastercard also offers a range of free tools and insights via its Small Business Cybersecurity Hub to help owners and entrepreneurs understand cyber risk, effectively defend against cyber threats and create effective, actionable plans for swift recovery.In October, Mastercard and Digital Main Street are partnering to release a tailored video course to educate small and medium enterprises on cybersecurity by leveraging Mastercard's cyber experts and Digital Main Street's knowledge to protect against cyber risks.  Empowering Diverse Small Business Owners with Cyber Skills All small business owners face barriers to cybersecurity preparedness and recovery, but those challenges can be magnified for owners and entrepreneurs from diverse and underrepresented populations.The Mastercard research found that women small business owners in Canada are less likely than their male counterparts to feel confident in the cybersecurity tools they've implemented (27% vs. 37%) and to feel confident that their businesses would fully recover following a cyberattack (46% vs. 53%). To expand Canadian women's skills and leadership in cybersecurity, Mastercard proudly partners with the Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst at Toronto Metropolitan University to deliver the Mastercard Emerging Leaders Cyber Initiative (ELCI): a unique leadership program for women and non-binary leaders who seek to advance into executive-level positions in cybersecurity or related fields.Although systemic barriers and cybersecurity capability gaps may be larger for diverse small business owners, Mastercard research also reveals that certain underrepresented groups are particularly inclined to explore new cybersecurity solutions. Take Indigenous small business owners, for example, who are significantly more willing than average (46% vs. 30%) to adopt innovative security measures such as biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or token identification—even if they come at an additional cost. Fostering this innovative spirit is exactly why Mastercard is proud to invest in Indigenous entrepreneurs in Canada via a three-year partnership with Pow Wow Pitch, providing crucial support for digital adoption and cybersecurity training as a part of its Indigenous Entrepreneur Bootcamp, as well as funding the Tech Stream of the Pow Wow Pitch program.Investing in Canadians to Drive Global Cybersecurity, Strengthen CommunitiesLaunched in 2020, Mastercard's Global Intelligence and Cyber Centre of Excellence (GICCoE) in Vancouver, BC, is leading innovation in cyber and intelligence (C&amp;I), artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Research from the GICCoE enhances Mastercard solutions, combining the biometric security algorithms with existing cyber capabilities to create new approaches and solutions for enhancing online security.Since then, Mastercard has invested over $9 million in Canadian partnerships to support small business cybersecurity, grow Canada's tech talent pipeline, and build a more secure, inclusive digital economy for everyone. This includes investing in early STEM and cyber education for girls and racialized students via Girls4Tech, Actua and Science World's ""Tech Up"" program, as well as scholarships for traditionally underrepresented students in STEM fields at the University of Victoria, the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and the University of British Columbia. Mastercard also partners with universities and technical institutes from coast to coast, including BCIT, the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology, and the University of New Brunswick advance cutting-edge cyber and internet of things (IoT) research.To learn more about Mastercard's cybersecurity initiatives in Canada and discover more cybersecurity research insights, please click here.About Mastercard (NYSE: MA)Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

The fishery industry employs 17 percent of Senegal's workforce (more than 600,000 people), and approximately 90 percent of the country's fish are caught by small-scale fishers who are reliant on traditional methods1. Their catch is typically sold to wholesale fish markets and small-scale fish processors, who are predominantly women.The Wireless Solutions for Fisheries in Senegal (WISE) program was launched, in collaboration with FHI 360, to use advanced wireless technology to improve fish catch and processing practices in the country's artisanal fish industry. The program is designed to make the practices of fishermen and fish processors safer and more efficient and can positively impacted the income and lives of those in the sector. WISE developed a mobile application that offers daily information on fish market prices, weather forecasts, navigation resources, microfinance and health insurance calculators and information on fishing and fish processing best practices, among other features.In 2022, the Senegalese government announced it will be officially adopting and expanding the program nationwide.

This FPGA is radiation-tolerant and conforms to the 6U SpaceVPX standard. The above specifications will result in enhanced speed, efficient and reliable data processing in orbit.The single SCFE6933 is said to achieve the same result that previously necessitated three boards. It integrates Xilinx Versal AI core powered by Advanced Micro Devices and is optimized for size, weight and power.This program was carried out in partnership with Ball Corporation’s BALL subsidiary, Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corporation, which is also the first client for the SCFE6933. Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corporation is a leading player in the aerospace industry and had previously selected Mercury Systems for a methane monitoring satellite project in June 2022.However, it should be noted that Ball Corporation reached an agreement in August 2023 to sell the aerospace business unit to BAE Systems for $5.6 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2024.Mercury Systems Inc Price and ConsensusMercury Systems Inc Price and ConsensusMercury Systems Inc price-consensus-chart | Mercury Systems Inc QuoteMRCY has introduced this product at the perfect time when there’s an increasing need for advanced data processing in orbital operations. The FPGA processing board will have a multifaceted role, such as reducing latency and facilitating the preprocessing of sensor data. This will empower space programs to respond swiftly to emerging threats and make timely decisions based on mission-critical information while keeping satellites’ costs low.The SCFE6933 FPGA processing board can be a crucial lifeline for Mercury in these challenging times. Despite the company's reputation as a reliable partner for the aerospace and defense sector due to its strategic position at the convergence of high-tech and defense, it is currently grappling with various program-related difficulties.Story continuesMRCY has a group of programs that underperformed, causing a significant drop in its financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This decline can be attributed to around 20 programs that faced substantial and unusual cost increases, mainly due to development difficulties.Dull Outlook Amid Setbacks in ProgramMercury’s financials took a hit of around $29 million in the fourth quarter and $56 million for the entire fiscal year due to the underperforming programs. Furthermore, elevated labor and material costs had a detrimental impact on both revenues and margins, given that nearly 90% of its program portfolio comprises the firm’s fixed-price contracts.Over the past few years, the company has also operated with the risk of customer concentration. Approximately 38% of its fiscal 2023 revenues were generated from three customers namely, Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, Raytheon Technologies RTX and Northrop Grumman.Lockheed Martin and Mercury had entered into an agreement to develop innovative sensor processing systems in Switzerland. In another collaboration, Raytheon and MRCY worked together to supply the processing hardware for the initial deployment of the U.S. Army's Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor.The defense prime contractors accounted for a substantial portion of Mercury's revenues in fiscal year 2023. This means that if any of these customers terminate the relationship with Mercury, the company could face a substantial drop in revenues.For fiscal 2024, MRCY expects revenues in the band of $950 million to $1 billion, indicating flat year-over-year growth at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $218.2 million, indicating a 4.1% year-over-year decline.Ball Corporation, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, while Mercury Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.

Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Medtronic PLC has increased its dividend each year since 1978. The stock is thus listed as a dividend aristocrat, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 45 years.Medtronic PLC (MDT): A Deep Dive into Its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityBreaking Down Medtronic PLC's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Medtronic PLC currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.33% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.37%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Over the past three years, Medtronic PLC's annual dividend growth rate was 8.00%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 8.10% per year. And over the past decade, Medtronic PLC's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 10.40%.Story continuesMedtronic PLC (MDT): A Deep Dive into Its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-07-31, Medtronic PLC's dividend payout ratio is 1.01, suggesting that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.Medtronic PLC's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Medtronic PLC's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-07-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Medtronic PLC's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Medtronic PLC's earnings increased by approximately -7.30% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 70.31% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 3.10%, which underperforms than approximately 66.8% of global competitors.Next StepsWhile Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) has a commendable history of consistent and growing dividends, investors should pay close attention to its high payout ratio and growth metrics. The company's profitability rank and net income suggest a strong financial position. However, the growth metrics indicate a slower pace compared to global competitors. Therefore, investors should carefully consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be trading at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor.

The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $13.03 per share, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co stock shows every sign of being modestly undervalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co's Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital.

Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11, which is worse than 84.41% of 1225 companies in the Vehicles &amp; Parts industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co at 4 out of 10, indicating that the financial strength of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co is poor.Unveiling Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co's Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co has been profitable 8 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $20.50 billion and a Loss Per Share of $1.29. Its operating margin of 2.91% is worse than 64.3% of 1252 companies in the Vehicles &amp; Parts industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co's profitability as fair.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth, according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 4%, which ranks worse than 54.83% of 1076 companies in the Vehicles &amp; Parts industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co's return on invested capital is 4.27, and its cost of capital is 7.58.Unveiling Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co's Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

The agency has granted priority review to this filing and a final decision is expected before Jan 17, 2024.The sNDA seeks approval for Welireg to treat adult patients with advanced RCC whose cancer has progressed following treatment with immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapies.An oral HIF-2α inhibitor, Welireg is approved in the United States and Europe to treat adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (“VHL”) disease who require therapy for associated RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.The filing is supported by data from the phase III LITESPARK-005 study, which evaluated Welireg in adult patients with advanced RCC that progressed following treatment with a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor and VEGF-TKI therapy, which was announcedlast month.Data from the LITESPARK-005 study showed that treatment with Welireg achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival(“PFS”), one of the study’s dual primary endpoints. The study also achieved its secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in the objective response rate (“ORR”). No new safety signals were reported in the study, and the safety profile of Welireg was in line with observations in its previous studies.Though a favorable trend was observed in the study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), it did not reach statistical significance. The study investigators will test the OS endpoint at a subsequent analysis. Merck intends to report data from the study at a future medical meeting.Per management, the LITESPARK-005 is the first late-stage study to show positive results in patients with advanced RCC who received a checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI therapy. With a potential label expansion in advanced RCC, Merck aims to introduce Welireg as a new treatment option that can reduce the risk of disease progression or death for an indication with low survival rates.Story continuesMerck’s shares have lost 3.2% year to date against the industry’s 7.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe LITESPARK-005 study is part of Merck's comprehensive late-stage development program on Welireg in RCC. The program comprises three other late-stage studies – LITESPARK-011, LITESPARK-012 and LITESPARK-022. While LITESPARK-011 and LITESPARK-012 evaluate Welireg in the second-line and treatment-naïve advanced disease settings, respectively, LITESPARK-022 evaluates Welireg in the adjuvant setting.Merck’s oncology portfolio is highly dependent on Keytruda, its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, which accounted for over 40% of the company’s revenues in the first half of 2023. With concerns over Keytruda’s potential loss of exclusivity post-2028, a label expansion to drugs like Welireg will enable the company to narrow down its dependence on the anti-PD-1 therapy.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.The company saw higher potash sales volumes in the first two months of the third quarter of 2023. Volumes rose by 4% year over year to 1.48 million tons for the period. MOS expects potash sales volumes to be close to the upper end of the previous guidance of 2.1-2.3 million tons for the third quarter. This reflects the continued robust demand in North America. Phosphate sales volumes also rose 10.4% year over year for July and August 2023 to 1.08 million tons.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill. The estimated total capital expenditures for 2023 are $1.3-$1.4 billion.Mosaic also aims to return substantial free cash flow in 2023 to shareholders. The company strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet.However, weaker potash and phosphate prices may impact the company’s margins. Prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Lower selling prices hurt sales and margins across the company’s Phosphate and Potash segments in the second quarter of 2023. Despite some recovery of late, weaker year-over-year fertilizer prices are expected weigh on the company’s profitability.Story continuesThe Mosaic Company Price and Consensus The Mosaic Company Price and ConsensusThe Mosaic Company price-consensus-chart | The Mosaic Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, Hawkins, Inc.

And to help make that happen, HDG is making use of Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) industrial automation technologies.In a recent successful project, HDG helped a large European manufacturer rethink product packaging to increase recyclability and reduce energy consumption. The European manufacturer wanted to transition from traditional laminated film packaging, which is difficult to recycle, to 100% recyclable, paper-based bagging.HDG, which specializes in the horizontal form, fill, and seal systems used to fill and seal bags, is also working with Rockwell to develop an energy monitoring solution that will help the European manufacturer access and visualize data to reduce energy use. As an early result of this work, HDG has uncovered an opportunity to lower the temperature of the heat used to seal bags-which will reduce energy costs by 20%. The video above provides further insights.Learn more about this innovation in industrial packaging, and how Rockwell is helping original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like HDG to re-engineer machines for sustainability.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rockwell Automation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Rockwell AutomationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rockwell-automationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Rockwell AutomationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/785923/sustainable-packaging-increasing-recyclability-while-decreasing-energy-consumption]"

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its main number, which went to hold then voicemail.The discovery has prompted airlines to change parts on a handful of planes and so far only a fraction of the 23,000 existing CFM56 engines has been affected.But Reeve said in court filings that CFM and its engine partners have ""compelling documentary evidence that thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the claimants' jet engines"".These include parts for CFM56 engines, built by the GE-Safran joint-venture CFM, and a very small number of CF6 engines used mainly to power cargo planes and manufactured purely by GE.Industry sources said the majority of spare parts sold by distributors like AOG involve small items that are not made by the engine makers themselves and are not considered critical.Story continuesEven so, the number of planes that could have to be taken out of service for checks is approaching 100 and analysts say any disruption to the tightly monitored system of controls underpinning the safety of air travel must be tackled quickly.Reeve said that so far, 86 falsified documents known as release certificates had been identified. By Monday, the number of engines suspected to have parts with forged documents had risen to 96.""Potentially, that means between 48 and 96 aircraft being taken out of service whilst airlines arrange for the parts to be removed,"" Reeve added.'COOPERATING FULLY'The sale of parts with fake or missing release certificates ""potentially puts aircraft safety in jeopardy"" and makes it impossible to verify airworthiness, CFM said in a filing.A release certificate is akin to a birth certificate for an engine part, guaranteeing it is genuine.The engine maker and its French and American parent companies took AOG and its sole director Jose Zamora Yrala to court to force them to hand over documents related to any remaining parts and paperwork linked to CFM56 and CF6 engines since February 2015.They said they were first alerted to the alleged forgery by a Portuguese maintenance and repair company in June, prompting a scramble to discover the extent of the issue.Lawyers representing AOG and Zamora Yrala said the defendants were ""cooperating fully"" with an investigation by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).AOG lawyer Tom Cleaver argued GE did not need a large amount of documents in order to contact possible buyers of the parts.""Everybody now knows that AOG parts are not necessarily to be taken to be the claimants' parts,"" he said.Judge Richard Meade ruled that AOG and Zamora Yrala should disclose ""invoices, release certificates, memos of shipment and purchase orders"" for 230 transactions.CFM welcomed the court order, which it said would help the industry identify unapproved parts more rapidly.CFM56 engines power the previous generation of Boeing 737s and about half the previous generation of Airbus A320s. These are gradually being upgraded but thousands remain in service.The CFM56 is also used on Boeing P-8 maritime patrol planes sold to the United States and Britain, while the GE-built CF6 powers Boeing KC-767A tankers sold to Italy and Japan.There have been no reports of suspect parts on military aircraft. Boeing and Airbus had no immediate comment.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, in a filing first reported by Bloomberg, said in August it was examining reports of parts with suspected falsified documents supplied by AOG. Britain's CAA said in August it was ""investigating the supply of a large number of suspect unapproved parts"".

The decision was released along with the Fed's quarterly economic projections, followed by a press conference held by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Investors are keenly watching for signals on whether the central bank will raise rates again at its next meeting in November. This comes as part of a series of interest rate increases over the past 14 months, with the Fed seeking to accomplish a soft landing by slowing down the economy without causing a recession.In other news, Ford (NYSE:F) saw its shares rise by 0.4% in pre-market trading after reaching a tentative deal with Canadian auto workers union Unifor, averting a potential strike involving 5,600 workers at the company’s facilities in Canada.

Per the forecast, China is poised to witness demand for 8,560 new commercial airplanes through 2042, buoyed by solid 11.4% growth expected in the nation’s air traffic.Projection HighlightsChina has largely contained the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the air travel demand and is lately witnessing a strong domestic air travel recovery.In light of such factors, Boeing expects China to contribute 20% of global airplane deliveries over the next two decades. The nation’s commercial airliner fleet is projected to surge, exceeding 9,600 aircraft, thus more than doubling its current size over 20 years.The American jet giant further projects that the Chinese commercial aircraft market will need 1,550 widebody airplanes, 190 new freighter deliveries and commercial services valued at $675 billion for maintenance, repair, training and spare parts by 2042.Benefits for BoeingChina remains a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with its Chinese customers, who represent a key component of its commercial aircraft backlog.As Boeing’s report suggests, China’s domestic aviation market is likely to become the world’s largest by 2042, driving the demand for approximately 6,470 single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737 Max family of aircraft. Such a strong demand forecast is likely to result in more order inflows for BA, thus boosting its revenue generation prospects.Peer ProspectsApart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that have an established position in the Chinese commercial aviation market and may gain from the flourishing demand are as follows:Airbus EADSY: The company enjoys significant demand in the region, with its service fleet in China rising to more than 2,100 aircraft up to 2023, implying more than 50% of the market.In April 2023, Airbus reached an agreement in the region to expand the A320 Family’s final assembly capacity with a second line at its Tianjin site. The agreement will contribute to Airbus’ overall rate objective of 75 aircraft per month in 2026 throughout its global production network.Story continuesEmbraer ERJ: The company has been recently awarded the Type Certificate by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (“CAAC”) for its E195-E2 jets after the successful approval received from the authority for its E190-E2 in November 2022.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US stock market and recent developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now.The Two-Day Fed MeetingOn September 19, the US Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting, leaving investors in a state of anticipation over what to expect next. Some argue that the Fed is not likely to hike rates again, while others provide an alternative response. Regardless of which camp ends up being right about this matter, it is indisputable that the Fed's September decision will immensely impact the market and those who hold a stake in it, making this a topic of interest for major stakeholders across the country.CNBC's 'Halftime Report' discussed this topic on September 19. Josh Brown, the CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, was among the experts invited on CNBC to comment on the situation on the ground right now. Here's what he had to say:""If we do still have more hurdles, and even possibly more rate hikes, that's gonna come because of what's going on with oil and gasoline prices - my opinion. You do have the stickiness in wages, you may not have the same rate of inflation but wages aren't going back down. You have the same phenomenon in shelter, particularly in rentals. That's not going back down. That stickiness is with us.""Brown continued to discuss how WTI crude oil and gasoline prices are on the rise at the moment. He noted that historically, recessions have almost always been preceded by ""an oil price shock"" or a ""spike."" However, for him, the recent increases in oil prices are not at that level yet - they have merely moved up gradually. And this factor is why Brown does not believe that the Fed is done with its rate hikes just yet.Where Should Investors Put Their Money?Investors should keep in mind that, at the moment, the markets are still in an unpredictable phase. The fact that the Fed's September decision is also just on the horizon means that investors should be extra careful with where they put their money. Karen Firestone, the CEO of Aureus Asset Management and a renowned portfolio manager, made the following comments on CNBC's 'Halftime Report' with regards to portfolio management:Story continues""What I feel is most important is to have a portfolio that encompasses companies that are going to have earnings growth that's greater than expected. You know, we can start seeing some earnings accelerations. And I think this is the first time in quite a long time that estimates are moving higher.""Companies with high earnings growth can thus be good bets for many investors during the second half of the year. However, another cohort of stocks some should look into is that of beaten-down stocks that have recently hit their 52-week lows. If investors can find a few companies that have proven their worth historically in terms of earnings growth and other fundamentals but are struggling in the market at present, they can probably come up with a portfolio of stocks that are reliable for the future and that can be bought at a bargain right now. Some such stocks include Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). There are many others that we have mentioned in our list below as well.

The analyst also maintained a price target of $240 on the stock.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”Like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a stock that is popular among many institutional investors and hedge funds today.6.

The company offers apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes, among more.Holding 2.9 million shares in the company, Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of the second quarter.Diamond Hill Capital said the following about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now13 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy Now11 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To ConsiderDisclosure: None. 13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

MYGN recently announced two key milestones in its strategic partnership with Illumina Inc. ILMN. The collaboration brings together Myriad’s MyChoice CDx homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) technology and Illumina’s expertise in comprehensive genomic profiling to broaden clinical research opportunities and drive CDx development for gene-based therapies.Achieving these breakthroughs empowers Myriad to accelerate the pace of research and scientific innovation to support the advancement of cancer care for patients.News in DetailUnder the strategic partnership, Myriad and Illumina are working together to advance comprehensive genomic profiling plus HRD testing using the globally distributed Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500) assay. The test enables comprehensive genomic profiling by analyzing 523 genes across DNA and RNA variants.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe first milestone achieved qualifies Myriad to conduct prospective clinical trial testing with an investigational-use-only test based on Illumina’s in-development IVD solution, the TruSight Oncology Comprehensive test (TSO Comp). This positions Myriad to partner with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to further the development of companion diagnostics.The second milestone involves Myriad’s initiation of its first reproducibility test project to support future regulatory filings for TSO Comp. Myriad now provides support for Illumina’s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to develop companion diagnostics on TSO Comp.Industry ProspectsPer a research report, the global cancer profiling market was valued at $9.59 billion in 2021 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 11.87% up to 2030.myChoiceCDx Progresses WellMyriad Genetics' progress worldwide with respect to the myChoiceCDx test is impressive. The company continues to record strong revenue growth from companion diagnostics, including a significant revenue share from its proprietary myChoiceCDx test. Having received FDA approval as a companion diagnostic test, MYGN intends to expand its market-leading myChoiceCDx to other indications like breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers for expanded pharma clinical trials and commercial testing.Story continuesEarlier in March 2023, Myriad Genetics expanded its partnership with Illumina to broaden access and the availability of oncology HRD testing in the United States. The TSO 500 HRD research-use-only test, which aligns Myriad’s MyChoice CDx HRD technology with Illumina’s pan-cancer test, TSO 500, is now available in the United States.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Myriad Genetics shares have decreased 25.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMyriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE and Quanterix QTRX, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to aid margin expansion. A solid balance sheet bodes well for the company’s long-term growth despite a high-interest-rate environment and elevated supply in certain markets.MAA’s portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, low-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units in a high-interest-rate environment continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid these positives, MAA is expected to continue maintaining a high level of occupancy in the upcoming period.Our projection for average physical occupancy in 2023 is 95.5%. For 2024 and 2025, the average physical occupancy is expected to remain elevated at 95.6% and 95.7%, respectively. Our projections for top-line growth point to an increase of 6.3% year over year in the current year.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sun Belt markets and a robust development pipeline, MAA’s redevelopment program and technology implementation are likely to drive margin expansion. We expect same-store net operating income (NOI) to grow 6.6% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Jun 30, 2023, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.4 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility.Also, MAA had a historically low Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.41. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the second quarter of 2023, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 7.91%. Moreover, it has a lower dividend payout compared with the industry. Further, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect core funds from operations (FFO) to increase 8.7% in 2023. Hence, we expect its dividend distribution to be sustainable in the upcoming period.Although shares of MAA have declined 5.9% in the past six months against the industry’s increase of 3.4%, analysts seem bullish regarding MAA’s FFO growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 FFO per share has been revised two cents downward over the past month. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Any hiccups in the share price are likely to provide a good entry point.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some of its markets. This is expected to put some pressure on rent growth in the upcoming periods. Furthermore, stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets is concerning. This affects MAA’s power to raise the rent or increase occupancy and leads to aggressive pricing for acquisitions.Although the company’s robust development and redevelopment pipeline is encouraging for long-term growth, supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressure could lead to cost overruns and lease-up concerns. This is likely to weigh on MAA’s profitability.Also, elevated rates imply a high borrowing cost for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts due to high interest rates.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the residential REIT sector are AvalonBay Communities AVB, American Homes 4 Rent AMH and Centerspace CSR. While Centerspace sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AvalonBay Communities and American Homes 4 Rent each have a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AvalonBay Communities’ 2023 FFO per share has increased three cents upward over the past month to $10.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Homes 4 Rent’s 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally northward in the past month to $1.65.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centerspace’s current-year FFO per share has moved 8.1% northward in the past two months to $4.65.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

173,1adfc55a-bd38-38fe-a2a5-d4273a31f6a3,MAA,2023-09-21,Sell Your House and Buy These 3 Real Estate Stocks???,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sell-house-buy-3-real-170810625.html,1694711290,STORY,"['AVB', 'MAA', 'INVH']","[Grant Cardone is the author of two bestselling books: The 10x Rule, and If You’re Not First, You’re Last. He also invests in multi-family residential real estate. He recently appeared in an article in Moneywise arguing that a home is a terrible investment. While the entrepreneur didn’t provide any recommendations about what real estate stocks to buy, he made it pretty clear an excellent place to start is multi-family residential.     People have a hard time hearing that their home is a poor investment. That’s especially true, given housing affordability in many parts of the United States and Canada has gotten out of control. For example, in Portland, Oregon—it’s a beautiful place, but it’s not exactly overrun with people like New York City—you need a salary of $147,170 to buy a home based on the median home price of $599,400. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe $120,000 required for a 20% down payment could provide you with a reasonably attractive passive income stream merely by opting to rent rather than buy. While I’m not suggesting you run out and sell your house and reinvest in these three real estate stocks, you likely wouldn’t regret it if you did. AvalonBay Communities (AVB)AVB stock: an Avalon sign in a garden next to a roadSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAvalonBay Communities (NYSE:AVB) announced on Sept. 6 that its same-store residential rental revenue for the first two months of Q3 2023 increased by 5.3%, 40 basis points higher than its July 31 guidance. As of the end of August, its occupancy rate was 95.6%, with rents up 3.9% in July and 3.0% in August. Based in Virginia, AvalonBay owns 294 apartment communities containing 88,659 apartments in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Interestingly, it expects 2023 full-year same-store revenue growth in its East Coast communities to be 7%, 200 basis points higher than in California and the Pacific Northwest. The five new communities it’s leasing up deliver significantly higher monthly rental revenue per home. Initially, the REIT projected an average revenue per home of $2,845. It will come in around $3,365, $520 higher than initial projections. Story continuesBetween Q2 2023 and Q4 2024, it expects to deliver 3,600 new apartments, increasing its rental revenue and core funds from operations (CFFO). Yielding 3.7%, every $100,000 poured into AVB will generate $3,700 in dividend income plus future capital appreciation. Having gone sideways the past five years, it’s AVB’s time to shine. Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockMid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) owns and operates 101,986 apartments in 16 states and the District of Columbia. MAA stock is trading at its lowest level since March 2021. It sits about $1 off its 52-week low. The Tennessee-based apartment REIT deserves better. Having paid quarterly dividends since 1994, it is a consistent achiever in the REIT industry.At the end of July, it reported Q2 2023 results that included a 12.9% increase in CFFO to $2.28 a share, an 8.1% increase in revenues, an 8.6% increase in net operating income, and a 9.3% average effective rent increase per unit. What’s not to like?As you can tell by its average effective rent per unit ($1,673) in the second quarter, Mid-America plays in a much different sandbox than AvalonBay. However, like AvalonBay, it’s got plenty of units in the development pipeline, which will continue to drive rents higher. As of June 30, it had 2,310 units in six projects under development that will cost $735 million to complete. It expects to have them all done by 2025. From a balance sheet perspective, it finished the second quarter with $4.4 billion in total debt outstanding with an average interest rate of 3.4% and 7.5 years to maturity. Its total debt to adjusted total assets is a reasonable 27.5%.   Yielding 4.1% from its $5.60 a share annual dividend rate, MAA stock would generate $400 in dividend income from a $100,000 investment.  Invitation Homes (INVH)Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shotSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.comMy first two real estate stocks to buy were apartment owners, so I thought I’d go with one of America’s leading single-family rental companies. Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) finished the second quarter with 76,593 homes in its same-store portfolio. Year-to-date, its core revenue growth was 6.9%, with a 4.4% increase in net operating income. Average occupancy was excellent at 97.7%, with a bad debt of just 1.7% of its gross rental revenue. It collected 98% of its rents in the second quarter, almost back to the 99% level before the pandemic. Given its portfolio of single-family rental homes, the typical acquisition of homes in a quarter is unremarkable. For example, in Q2 2023, it acquired 276 homes for $88 million. However, it sold 378 for $141 million, a net disposition of 102 homes. Fortunately, in July, it acquired nearly 1,900 homes for $650 million, an average of $342,105 per home, below the June 2023 national median price of $410,200.This is vital to its long-term success. While it doesn’t want to buy rundown properties, it can’t afford to overspend on the purchase because it will have to spend on sprucing up the homes for prospective tenants. In Q2 2022, the average monthly rent at its homes was $2,127. It’s increased the past four quarters, ending Q2 2023 at $2,285, 7.4% higher than a year ago. People have to live somewhere. Investing in INVH is no different than AVB or MAA. While it yields just 3.0%, the capital appreciation potential is higher.  This stock and the others we mentioned are all top real estate stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The contract will serve the U.S. Army, and the governments of Poland and Kuwait.Work related to this deal will be executed in Sterling Heights, MI.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military spending has witnessed an increase in the past few years to modernize and upgrade the defense system to meet the current warfare requirements. In such a scenario, the demand for military tanks has increased manifold as these form an integral part of any land warfare system.Thus, General Dynamics stands to benefit from the increased demand as its Land Systems is the sole-source producer of two foundational products central to the U.S. Army’s warfighting capabilities — the M1A2Abrams main battle tank and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle.The company strives to continuously improvise the platform and provide an upgraded version to its customers.

This will allow the platform to adopt and incorporate transformative capabilities in the future.Such capability in manufacturing combat vehicles must have enabled General Dynamics to win multiple orders for the Abrams Tank as well as system and sustainment technical support services contracts involving the same, like the latest one. This has bolstered the defense giant’s revenue generation prospects from combat vehicles.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension have made it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any combat mission and land warfare affair.Going forward, per a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.2% during 2023-2030. The expanding size of this market should benefit General Dynamics, with its Land Systems unit being the sole-source producer of two renowned lethal tank fleet — the M1A2 Abrams main battle tank and the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle.Other defense majors that are likely to benefit from the growing global armored vehicle market are BAE Systems Plc BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and RTX Corp.

181,13d32c51-4035-30b0-9f8a-73d9fff7a617,WFC,2023-09-21,"MSR trading should finish strong in 2023, but there are headwinds",HW Media,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/msr-trading-finish-strong-2023-114400240.html,1695210240,STORY,['WFC'],"[Mortgage servicing rights MSRsTrading volume in the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) market this year is still on track to reach or slightly exceed 2022’s $1 trillion mark, with trading volume in the fourth quarter of this year projected to be robust as market players race to finish deals prior to year’s end.Still, there are challenges facing the MSR market related to the staying power of the huge volume of mortgage servicing rights now being traded that are pegged to legacy loans at low interest rates — in the 3% to 4% range.That challenge is compounded by the low level of new-loan production now being booked at much higher coupons in the 6% to 7% range. MSRs linked to those higher-rate loans tend to have lower values compared with legacy MSRs due to the higher risk of prepayment when rates start to decline.The tailwinds, however, also are strong, with a high level of investor interest in acquiring MSRs, which are seen as solid, relatively safe investments. That demand means now is an opportune time for smaller, struggling independent mortgage banks (IMBs) to sell MSRs to manage cash flow and their balance sheets as pricing is likely at a high point in the market.“I would say a $1 trillion-plus year [for MSR trading volume in 2023] is not a bad estimate,” said Mike Carnes, managing director of the MSR valuation group at Mortgage Industry Advisory Corp (MIAC). “The prime time for getting a deal in the market would probably be this month or next month.“People are trying to get their deals done before the end of the year, so what a lot of them will do is they’ll get their deals out now with the intention of closing the deal by November.”For bulk public auctions alone, MIAC since the start of the second quarter this year has brought to market a total of seven MSR agency offerings valued at nearly $11 billion based on loan-portfolio balances, with three of those deals going to bid this month, according to Carnes. He said MIAC has overseen another $40 billion in MSR offerings via private deals.Story continuesTom Piercy, managing director of Incenter Mortgage Advisors, agrees that MSR trading volume by year’s end should be in the $1 trillion range. He said there was a “tremendous amount of volume” in the first half of the year, adding that there was a bit of a slowdown in MSR trading volume in the third quarter of this year.Incenter has overseen 10 bulk agency MSR public offerings since the start of the second quarter of this year valued at nearly $76 billion based on loan-portfolio balances.“I would say 50% to 70% of our deals are done now on a negotiated nonauction basis,” Piercy said. “In a span of about six weeks [earlier this year], we did multiple trades that totaled in excess of $100 billion.”The bulk of MSR trades to date have involved legacy loans with “a sub-4% WAC” [weighted average coupon], Piercy said. Carnes noted that most of the outstanding mortgages nationwide “now have an interest rate of 4% or less.”“My concern is ultimately these low WAC deals … how much of it is really left [to trade]?” Piercy added. “We’re at [roughly] 30%, of where we were two years ago in the number of [new mortgage] units being originated, so that’s going to dry up [the legacy MSR trades] and then you’ve got this low [new-loan origination] volume.“I’m very concerned with where the volumes will be 12 months out that will satisfy some of these objectives for these MSR investors. And that’s a headwind for the market.”Nick Smith, founder, managing partner and CEO of Minneapolis-based private-equity firm Rice Park Capital Management, an active MSR buyer, agrees that many of the MSRs tied to low-rate legacy loans are going to be purchased by new owners who are willing to own them for a long time. That means they will not be traded again any time soon.“Right now, a lot of them [MSRs for legacy loans] are controlled by transitional owners, which are the IMBs that originated them in 2020 and 2021, and now they’re looking to unload them,” Smith said.Unlike Piercy, however, Smith is far more bullish on the staying power of the legacy loan MSRs. He points out that the total supply of legacy loan MSRs is in the range of $6 trillion — a byproduct of the great refinancing boom in 2020 and 2021.“There’s trillions of it left [to trade],” he stressed. “I mean, 74% of the market refinanced in two years, and there’s maybe only $2 trillion to $3 trillion that’s traded in the last few years.“That means there’s still roughly half of it that’s left to go, and that’s in addition to just the normal production that’s being produced now.”AmortizationAzad Rafat is senior director of MSR services at Mortgage Capital Trading (MCT), which provides advisory and brokerage services primarily for smaller MSR deals — typically less than a $1 billion. He said the smaller MSR deals involve sellers that are generally the group most impacted by the higher interest rates that have devastated origination volumes since early last year, and many are selling MSRs to make ends meet.Since the start of the second quarter, a total of at least 10 bulk agency MSR public offerings valued at $5.3 billion have been brokered by MCT and/or its partner Prestwick Mortgage Group. Rafat said MCT tends to serve smaller IMBs.“Most of the companies during this year and toward the end of last year, they started releasing more MSRs than they retain,” Rafat said. “Typically, we see for the industry average about 30% [MSR] retention and 70% released [or sold].“However, some IMBs are literally releasing 90% to 100% of their [MSR] production.”Rafat said for these lenders, the value of the remaining MSRs held in portfolio starts to be impacted negatively — if not replenished — due to natural runoff from prepayments and also from the impact of amortization.“Literally, every other week we have different clients come to us and say, ‘What has happened in my portfolio [because it’s losing value]?’” Rafat explained. “They’re not adding enough [MSRs] to replenish the paydown from principal payments along with regular prepayments [due to death, divorce and relocations, etc.]“Every single principal payment that comes in increases month over month [while the share going to interest decreases], so you have a passive, natural principal amortization just by the borrower making regular payments. So, it’s not benefiting the overall MSR portfolio that they have on their books.”Rafat added that he is seeing smaller IMBs trying to manage their MSR portfolios, “and some of them are thinking about exiting [the market] completely.”“Definitely a lot of them are facing financial stress,” he added, “and we are also getting inquiries from IMBs looking for other IMBs to acquire.”MSR investorsRice Park Capital’s Smith said the MSR buyers in the market now include private investor groups that simply own MSRs and are seeking to expand their portfolios. They include Smith’s firm and other major investors like Annaly Capital Management, Grandeur Peak Global Advisors, Seneca Mortgage Investments and Marlin Mortgage, among many others.In addition, another class of MSR buyers are what Smith describes as “hybrid investors,” which “both create mortgages, and they invest in mortgages,” including MSRs. They include players such as Lakeview Loan Servicing (a member of the Bayview Companies), Pennymac, Mr. Cooper, Rithm Capital and Two Harbors Investment Corp.A third group of MSR buyers (and sellers) are traditional IMBs, “which are in the business of making loans and selling them off to the market,” Smith said. They include large mortgage lenders like United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), CrossCountry Mortgage, loanDepot and Movement Mortgage as well as a host of smaller IMBs with a few billion dollars of origination annually or less — many of them just hanging on for survival until the market improves.“And I think that group is in a little bit of a limbo because they aren’t making money off originations generally, and as an industry they’re [IMBs] losing money,” Smith said. “They’re net sellers of MSRs to the market.“So, they’re just on a treadmill in which they make loans, … and they sell them off [including MSRs] into the market, and until the market turns, they’re going to have a hard time making money.”The banksSmith added another major group in the MSR market is the banks, which as a group, he said, have “flat or shrinking” MSR portfolios, “with the exception of maybe Chase [JP Morgan].”Bank agency MSR holdings totaled $2.78 trillion in 2018, according to data provided by mortgage-data analytics firm Recursion. As of September 2023, bank agency MSR holdings stood at $2.75 trillion — essentially flat. For IMBs over the same period, according to Recursion, MSRs holdings increased from a total of $3 trillion to $5.8 trillion, up some 92%.An example of a major bank that has been shrinking its MSR portfolio this year is Wells Fargo, which went from being the top holder of all-agency MSRs as of June of this year to No. 4 as of September, according to Recursion. Ranking ahead of Wells now are Lakeview Loan Servicing, Pennymac and JPMorgan.Wells Fargo’s MSR third-party servicing portfolio shrunk from $666.8 billion as of March 31 to $609.1 billion as of June 30 in the wake of a selling a $50 billion block of MSRs, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. The buyer, according to industry sources, was Mr. Cooper.“During the first quarter, we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said during the bank’s Q1 earnings call. “We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business.”Smith said based on the public comments that Wells Fargo has made about looking to curtail their servicing portfolio, “I think it’s reasonable to expect they’re going to keep doing that until they trim their portfolio to the size that makes sense for them.”“They didn’t say how much they would sell,” he added, “but I think by deduction the number that they have to sell is much larger than what has been sold so far.”Piercy stressed, however, that banks remain opportunistic MSR buyers, focused on conventional Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac MSRs, while IMBs continue to dominate in the Ginnie Mae sector — which involves higher-risk loans.“The MSR asset itself for a bank is really attractive because what does it do?” Piercy explains. “It gives them access to customers via recapture capabilities, but as importantly it’s a source of low-cost deposits.“Those escrow balances are worth something now, which they hadn’t been for years. You’ve got escrow balances [for taxes and insurance] now that earn upward of 5%, if not more, So there’s a tremendous amount of value of the MSR asset to a depository.”Recursion’s most recent MSR market report, current as of September 2023, provides the following information on lender MSR rankings for both banks and nonbanks.• All-agency MSR ranking based on holdings and market share: 1. Lakeview (7%); 2. Pennymac (6.6%); 3. JP Morgan (6.2%); 4. Wells Fargo (6.2%); 5. Mr. Cooper (5.8%)• Freddie Mac MSRs: 1. JP Morgan [10.4%]; 2. Wells Fargo (6.8%); 3. Mr. Cooper (5.8%); 4.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US stock market and recent developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now.The Two-Day Fed MeetingOn September 19, the US Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting, leaving investors in a state of anticipation over what to expect next. Some argue that the Fed is not likely to hike rates again, while others provide an alternative response. Regardless of which camp ends up being right about this matter, it is indisputable that the Fed's September decision will immensely impact the market and those who hold a stake in it, making this a topic of interest for major stakeholders across the country.CNBC's 'Halftime Report' discussed this topic on September 19. Josh Brown, the CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, was among the experts invited on CNBC to comment on the situation on the ground right now. Here's what he had to say:""If we do still have more hurdles, and even possibly more rate hikes, that's gonna come because of what's going on with oil and gasoline prices - my opinion. You do have the stickiness in wages, you may not have the same rate of inflation but wages aren't going back down. You have the same phenomenon in shelter, particularly in rentals. That's not going back down. That stickiness is with us.""Brown continued to discuss how WTI crude oil and gasoline prices are on the rise at the moment. He noted that historically, recessions have almost always been preceded by ""an oil price shock"" or a ""spike."" However, for him, the recent increases in oil prices are not at that level yet - they have merely moved up gradually. And this factor is why Brown does not believe that the Fed is done with its rate hikes just yet.Where Should Investors Put Their Money?Investors should keep in mind that, at the moment, the markets are still in an unpredictable phase. The fact that the Fed's September decision is also just on the horizon means that investors should be extra careful with where they put their money. Karen Firestone, the CEO of Aureus Asset Management and a renowned portfolio manager, made the following comments on CNBC's 'Halftime Report' with regards to portfolio management:Story continues""What I feel is most important is to have a portfolio that encompasses companies that are going to have earnings growth that's greater than expected. You know, we can start seeing some earnings accelerations. And I think this is the first time in quite a long time that estimates are moving higher.""Companies with high earnings growth can thus be good bets for many investors during the second half of the year. However, another cohort of stocks some should look into is that of beaten-down stocks that have recently hit their 52-week lows. If investors can find a few companies that have proven their worth historically in terms of earnings growth and other fundamentals but are struggling in the market at present, they can probably come up with a portfolio of stocks that are reliable for the future and that can be bought at a bargain right now.

The company manufactures life science tools and integrates systems for large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.An Outperform rating was reiterated on shares of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) on September 1 by Vijay Kumar, an analyst at Evercore ISI Group. The analyst also maintained a price target of $240 on the stock.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”Like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a stock that is popular among many institutional investors and hedge funds today.6. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45There were 45 hedge funds long Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $882.9 million.Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, maintained an Outperform rating on shares of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) on August 17. The analyst also placed a price target of $162 on the stock.Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a consumer staples company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The company offers apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes, among more.Holding 2.9 million shares in the company, Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of the second quarter.Diamond Hill Capital said the following about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now13 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy Now11 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To ConsiderDisclosure: None. 13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

PayPal notes that blockchain network fees apply.PYUSD, which launched last month, is issued by Paxos Trust Company and is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S Treasuries and similar cash equivalents.

As it stands, the total supply of circulating PYUSD is $44.376 million, according to Etherscan data.""PYUSD is already present in native crypto experiences, and continues to be made more broadly available as the ecosystem grows,"" the company said in a blog post.

Just days later, Paxos announced that it received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its work with Binance on the stablecoin BUSD.PayPal’s stablecoin efforts were kept under wraps for months, but then the company in August finally unveiled PYUSD, which, unsurprisingly, was built in collaboration with Paxos.The crypto industry cheered the publicly traded company’s entrance into the stablecoin market, even though some questioned how the stablecoin would differentiate itself from existing heavyweights Tether and USDC.Story continuesIn the month since its launch, the stablecoin’s market capitalization is a bit less than $44 million, according to a recent report on the coin released by Paxos.

Instacart (CART) stock falls by over 10% to close out its first full trading day. Lastly, RBC analysts initiate coverage on IBM, rating it at ""Outperform"" with a price target of $188.Yahoo Finance Live's Akiko Fujita and Josh Lipton highlight some of the top trending stocks after Wednesday's closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Shares of Arm closed in the day in the red. Says their tough times are persisting as Cathie Wood is advising to stay away from the stock. That's amid too much emphasis on artificial intelligence.So this one is an interesting name, Akiko. So Arm, obviously there were some questions about that. Skeptics didn't like the valuation. They didn't like the headwinds to growth, right? Obviously we think of Arm, we think of the smartphone market, which is slowing.On AI, it's interesting because I was talking to tech analyst Patrick Moorhead. I know you know Patrick. Here's how he would put it. He would say Arm is a secondary player in AI. He says, listen, they're not-- they're not Nvidia, which, of course, poster child of the AI boom. But he did point out that Nvidia with its new superchip for the data center, the GH100, does have-- that is a combination, he said of Nvidia's GPUs and Arm CPUs. His point is they are a player but maybe not enough of a player for Cathie Wood, apparently.AKIKO FUJITO: And that goes to kind of why we have seen Arm now in its fourth straight day of declines. The initial pop we saw on the expectation that they are going to be a player in the game, but since then we've seen analysts initiate coverage with some skepticism. Cathie Wood the latest to join in, but it really does point to what we have heard from Needham as well as Bernstein saying, look, it's not that we don't believe the AI story. We just haven't seen it, and we don't know how significant a revenue driver it's going to be moving forward.Story continuesInstacart also following Arm in the postdebut struggles, closing its first full trading day in the red. I mean, certainly too early to say where Instacart is likely to land in terms of where the company is. But, you know, part of this, Josh, is also trying to figure out where the competition is for the company. The company has talked a lot about sort of the ads now really driving revenue, but Instacart is still being seen as this grocery-delivery company. What are these additional tentacles they have to drive revenue beyond their core business?JOSH LIPTON: And Instacart itself says-- I mean, that's a great point because they themselves say, listen you've got a lot of competition. Potentially they called out everybody from Walmart to DoorDash to Uber, so there is a lot of it.AKIKO FUJITO: Yeah. Let's move on to our next stock that we're watching. Shares of IBM higher today after RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on the stock Wednesday with an outperform rating and a price target of $188 a share. Analyst Matthew Swanson optimistic on the competitive positioning and unique role that IBM plays in the tech ecosystem.You know, I was looking up this note, Josh, but really, in some ways, this is kind of an outlier, right? 28% of analysts still have a buy rating, but 67% have--JOSH LIPTON: On the sidelines.AKIKO FUJITO: --a hold.JOSH LIPTON: No love for Big Blue.AKIKO FUJITO: No love for Big Blue, but RBC saying, look, there's a bit of a misunderstanding of what exactly their software business is, and that's why it's largely undervalued.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I mean, listen, IBM has not done much this year, right? It's up single digits. But if you're a bull, you say great. It's underappreciated. And listen, there are bulls who like-- they look at hybrid. They look at AI. They look at consulting, and they're fans.AKIKO FUJITO: Yeah, I mean, the stock getting a lift, at least on one day here, on the back of RBC's initiation. $188 a share, which implies 28% upside to where we saw it close on Tuesday.JOSH LIPTON: Yep.]"

The rise in the stock value is attributed to an outperform rating assigned by Matthew Swanson, an analyst from RBC Capital, marking a shift in the company's outlook.Swanson recently set a $188 price target for IBM, the highest target set for the company on Wall Street. He believes that IBM's software and consulting services are underappreciated and stand to benefit from post-pandemic trends in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which are complicating IT environments.This optimistic view on IBM comes after several strategic moves by the company, including the acquisition of Red Hat, an open-source software titan, in 2019 and the appointment of Arvind Krishna as CEO in 2020. These changes have contributed to altering the once gloomy outlook on IBM, primarily due to disruption caused by Silicon Valley cloud firms.Despite experiencing a slight dip of 0.4% in revenue last quarter due to a cyclical downturn in its hardware and infrastructure sectors, IBM's software division expanded by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by Red Hat's growth of 11%, along with a 10% rise in data and AI products, and a 5.3% increase in the consulting segment.The acquisition of Red Hat has proven to be a strategic move for IBM. It helps businesses manage complex IT environments that involve public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises computing with intricate computing and governance rules.IBM has also shown aggressive investment behavior in AI this year, with seven hybrid cloud and AI acquisitions completed in 2023 alone. In May, IBM unveiled the Watsonx platform in partnership with the open-source AI start-up Hugging Face. This platform provides a range of services for generative AI, data storage, and data governance across multiple clouds.Despite a history of stagnant financial performance, IBM is gradually gaining investor confidence. As Silicon Valley giants focus on developing proprietary solutions within their own clouds, IBM could potentially establish a robust business assisting enterprises in managing complexity and working with multi-cloud environments.Story continuesCurrently, IBM's stock offers a 4.5% yield, making it an attractive option for investors seeking dividends. Moreover, the company's software franchise appears to be in a stronger position now than in previous years. However, the success of its Watsonx platform remains to be seen due to stiff competition in the AI sector.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 5/10Profitability rank: 7/10Growth rank: 2/10GF Value rank: 3/10Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned International Business Machines Corp the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: International Business Machines CorpWith a market cap of $137.32 billion and sales of $60.52 billion, International Business Machines Corp is a significant player in the software industry.

IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world, demonstrating its substantial outward impact.Story continuesInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsFinancial Strength AnalysisInternational Business Machines Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 2.86, which is below the safe threshold of 2.99. This suggests potential financial struggles if the Altman Z-score drops below 1.81. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.27 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.72, which is worse than 95.1% of 2101 companies in the Software industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where International Business Machines Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Over the past five years, International Business Machines Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -21.7, while the five-year growth rate is at -13.8. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability.International Business Machines Corp (IBM): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While IBM has a rich history and significant market presence, these metrics suggest that it may struggle to maintain its historical performance levels. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

With concerns surrounding the United Auto Workers’ (UAW) strike and oil prices reaching as high as $100 per barrel, discussions surrounding clean energy and vehicle electrification are becoming more prevalent.White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi sits down with Yahoo Finance’s Akiko Fujita to explain the current progress the Biden administration is making in clean energy investments“We’ve got to invest in those workers and we’ve got to bring them into this broad supply chain,” Zaidi says, addressing auto workers’ concerns over being replaced by automation. “We have an opportunity to not just deliver the product but have this be a moment of uplift for workers in the American middle-class.”When asked about a shift in public declarations from businesses’ commitment to clean energy investment, Zaidi said “smart money is still chasing climate change solutions”. Zaidi confirms the Biden Administration’s devotion to energy transitions by stating “$240 billion of capital has been committed to expanding clean energy deployment and manufacturing here in the United States, 100 new factories and counting…” since the Inflation Reduction Act’s signing.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: The Biden administration finds itself with two very conflicting agendas. While President Biden advocates for well-paying labor jobs, carmakers are saying they're struggling to meet those demands because of the investments that are needed to transition into all electric vehicles. I sat down with White House National Climate advisor Ali Zaidi for more on the administration's agenda and where they see the climate agenda moving forward.ALI ZAIDI: No. I think the president's been really clear we see record profits, and that should translate into record contracts. I think longer term, here's what I see. Number one is the price of the core technology continuing to come down. Lithium ion batteries in August reduced prices by 9% month-over-month, 31% year-over-year. And we continue to see improvement on that cost trajectory.Story continuesWe're seeing more and more investment pack into this transformation. The US is now the number one nation that's attracting capital into this transformation. Over $210 billion committed against this objective. So I think there's a lot to navigate as the transition takes place, including building out charging infrastructure, having the supportive resilient supply chains. But this is a road we can travel. We can travel it together. We can travel it in a way that produces not only electric vehicles but good-paying union jobs.AKIKO FUJITA: You've heard the UAW workers say before, the concern with the EV transition is that these cars don't require as many workers. At the same time, you've got other jobs that are being created with batteries moving forward. How do you get the buy-in from particularly labor unions on the EV transition when they have spent decades building ICE cars?ALI ZAIDI: You know, we have the best workers in the world. That's part of our competitive advantage as a country. As we write this next chapter of the automotive journey, we've got to invest in those workers. And we've got to bring them into this broad supply chain.There's a whole industry that stands behind that final assembly-- the input materials being sourced from states all across the country, the batteries, and frankly, before the batteries even, the input materials that go into them, the anodes, the cathodes, the raw lithium supplies and others. And in all of those, we have an opportunity to not just deliver the product but have this be a moment of uplift for workers and the American middle class.So that's how we're focused is how do we win as much of the finish line as possible, not just put electric vehicles on the road, but have them be stamped made in America, with products sourced in America, with workers who are being paid good wages, good benefits, and have the right to bargain.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about where oil is right now. We're quickly approaching $100 a barrel. When you think about oil production under this administration, we're reaching record levels. At the same time, you've got with you leading the way the administration talking about this transition to net zero away from fossil fuels. How do these two agendas move in tandem when there is pressure on the administration to act in trying to bring gas prices down?ALI ZAIDI: Well, we've got to walk and chew gum at the same time to use a bit of a cliche. We've got to meet the American consumers where they there. There are people who have to pump up gasoline to get from point A to point B. We need to make sure that they are not absorbing either the cost of Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which is impacting dramatically global markets, or corporate profits and efficiencies that are being subsidized by consumers.So we've got to make sure that we're meeting that demand. The president's used extraordinary tools working with allies and partners releasing on a strategic basis reserves of petroleum to stabilize the market, working to make sure there's adequate supply. But he's been clear all along that the path to energy security to consumer energy security is shifting to clean energy.You look at the volatility of global oil prices and motor gasoline over the last 20, 25, 50 years, and you look at the volatility of electricity prices on the retail side over that same time period, and it's two totally different stories. One, we control our destiny because we generate that source of energy here at home. It's not traded on global market. Those wires that carry electricity long ways don't reach overseas. And they produce electricity cleaner and more efficiently to get folks plugged in.So whether it's hydrogen or it's battery electric hybrid, there are strategies here for us to boost energy security, consumer energy security. And we're chasing after that.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about the conversation that's been happening on the ground here during Climate Week. We heard from Treasury Secretary Yellen talk specifically about the economic risks that stem from climate change. You know, I think the numbers you quoted was $3 trillion in terms of what needs to be invested to get to that net-zero goal in 2050. And yet when you think about the big companies, there feels like there has been a shift at least in the public declarations in how committed they are because of the backlash that has happened politically. What are you hearing behind the scenes?ALI ZAIDI: I think what we're hearing behind the scenes is that smart money is still chasing climate solutions. And that we've got to find ways collectively to get that capital to flow volumetrically more significantly and to flow faster.AKIKO FUJITA: Have you seen it accelerate?ALI ZAIDI: We have seen it accelerate. If you look at just what's happened in the last year since the president signed the Inflation Reduction Act, $240 billion of capital has been committed to expanding clean energy deployment and manufacturing here in the United States, a hundred new factories and counting to manufacture those products here in the United States, projects the size of the Hoover Dam repeated on a regular basis in terms of imagination and then steel in the ground here in the US.So I think the trajectory is very clear. We know what the solutions are. And the opportunity is massive. So I think that's why folks are chasing these solutions, whether it's the private equity and the venture capital funds, who are making the bets with their capital allocation, whether it's the lenders in this space figuring out new ways to underwrite based on the technologies and the market demand, or it's the corporates who are stepping up and taking action. But we need a lot more of it. And we need a lot more of it right away.]"

A source told Automotive News that Unifor was seeking wage gains well “north of 20%,” and that pension plan expansion had been a sticking point.Union demonstrators march past West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Sept. 19, 2023. (Blair Gable/REUTERS) (Blair Gable / reuters)“We believe that this tentative agreement, endorsed by the entire master bargaining committee, addresses all of the items raised by members in preparation for this round of collective bargaining,” Unifor national president Lana Payne said in a statement.The contract between Ford of Canada and Unifor expired on Sept. 18 at 11:59PM, but both sides continued to negotiate on a deal, with no strike called for by Unifor. Unifor said it had opened formal negotiations with Ford on Aug. 10, as it had picked Ford as its “target” company for securing an initial deal, which Unifor will then use to negotiate with other automakers — GM and Stellantis.In the US, meanwhile, Stellantis said this week it is currently engaged in negotiations with the UAW. But a source close to the talks tells Yahoo Finance negotiations with GM (GM) have hit some road bumps.Striking United Auto Workers member Brandon Cappelletty holds his strike sign outside the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, Sept. 19, 2023. (Rebecca Cook/REUTERS) (Rebecca Cook / reuters)GM has apparently continued its “dialogue” with the UAW, the source said, but the “gap is very big” between where the two sides are currently positioned.Finally the source said it was not clear at this point which UAW demands were the most important, or needed to be included in any deal.As for Ford, despite its recent win in Canada, in the US negotiations are ongoing, though the company has not publicly issued a contract proposal since Sept. 14, the day its contract with the UAW expired.Story continuesThe cost incentive of finding a deal soon for the Big Three automakers is rising, as UAW president Shawn Fain said this week that the union would “stand up” strike at additional plants at noon on Friday of this week if “substantial progress” hasn’t been made in talks with the automakers. Currently the strike — which began six days ago — would cost the automakers around $100 million to $125 million each per week, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.Now Barclays is predicting that if the strike were to expand on Friday, the UAW could target the automaker’s big truck plants, which assemble extremely popular and profitable pickups like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram 1500, in order to hasten the negotiating process.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But there may be a light at the end of the tunnel, with Ford of Canada and Unifor reaching a new tentative labor contract to cover unionized employees. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian to break this down for us. Hey, Pras.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Rachelle. You have some good news here. Potentially, Ford Cadillac, you mentioned, struck a labor contract with Unifor which is the Union that represents Canadian Ford workers. The Union and Canada-- Ford Canada had hammered out the deal-- excuse me --24 hours after the original strike deadline had passed there in Canada. That's the Canada strike, not our strike.And the two sides, apparently working for the last six weeks. We don't know much about the deal yet. But the Union members need to ratify the deal. So they don't want to give away some of the ins and outs.But we're hearing that automotive news is reporting that the Union got a wage hikes of over 20%. So that is kind of a good starting point there for striking workers here in the States, kind of a precedent is set. And maybe, that's where they can start going from a wages point of view. And then hopefully, into the benefits and other things like that.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's interesting because that strike in Canada would have been a total walkout versus the strategic one in the US. But there is a possibility that the strikes in the US could expand now. And the effects could be widespread, right?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. The Union the UAW here in the States, [? Sean ?] Fein talking about how if substantial progress has not been made by Friday at noon here, more workers will be called on to strike. We haven't seen-- they're not saying where they'll actually strike, what new plants will actually be hit. But they could expand to other factories.They could actually expand the strikes of the current factories that they're at right now. So for instance, at Ford, the Michigan assembly plant in Detroit, only part of the plant is on strike. So we might see more of that there. So for their part, the automakers say that they are negotiating. They haven't walked away from the table.But as you mentioned, the ripple effects have already occurred. We're seeing German auto giant, ZF, laying off workers in Michigan because of the spillover effects. [? U.S. ?] Steel might idle a steel furnace in Illinois for risk mitigation purposes. So that's happening there.And meanwhile, Barclays, the investment bank, saying that this expands, the Union may target the big truck plants, which are huge moneymakers for the big three. So that could be more pain for them, potentially by Friday, if, like you said, if substantial progress has not been made.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Airline Stocks to Buy Now.Air travel industry is in recovery mode with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening of the global economy. Unlike in the past three years, there has been a shift with most travelers opting for international travel, something that is helping airlines draw in big revenues from air travel fees and ticket sales.The pandemic brought many challenges as the travel industry came to a standstill. Many airlines plunged into debt and lost a combined $200 billion between 2020 and 2022. It’s only now that most are slowly returning to profitability as they salivate to serve travel-deprived consumers with the easing of travel restrictions worldwide.Major airlines led by United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines continue to rake in huge profits owing to passengers’ willingness to pay higher fares supported by increasing travel demand. The airlines have also benefited from a shortage of airplanes and pilots, allowing them to charge a premium on travel fees without much resentment. Nevertheless, the increase in consumer spending on travel and entertainment remains one of the biggest catalysts for the airline industry.The average cost of flying in the US has increased significantly to historic highs in the industry, bouncing back from the pandemic turmoil. The consumer price index for airline tickets is already up by more than 20% for the year, representing the largest jump since the Federal Reserve started racking the index.Executives from the major airlines expect air travel fares to continue increasing in response to the high demand amid a shortage of planes. Similarly, the executive expects demand for air travel to surge despite the ever-growing risk of recession.Despite the high cost of traveling amid the high inflation and interest rate environment, people continue to make travel arrangements. A Bank of America study showed that spending at airlines and travel agencies is already by more than 60% for the year as more people continue to make travel arrangements.Story continuesNearly two out of every adults plan to take a vacation before year-end, with most shrugging off the rising prices and interest rates.“This year, as prices and interest rates continue to push higher, we’re seeing more signals that vacationers are adapting their plans. Many are still going somewhere, but they’re being more thoughtful about how they’re spending,” said Ted Rossman Bankrate, senior industry analyst The surge in air travel fares has to do with many carriers needing to improve in rebuilding their pre-pandemic flight schedules. A global shortage of aircraft has seen a reduction in aircraft in the tarmacs needed to address the influx of air travel demand. A restricted supply of seats amid high demand is expected to support prices that should allow airlines to continue generating more revenues.On the other hand, the biggest risk to the airline industry is the rising cost of jet fuel. Energy prices have increased significantly in recent months, with crude oil rallying to ten-month highs of $90 a barrel. The increasing energy costs are likely to trigger higher inflation, something that could affect consumer purchasing power, prompting most of them to shelve their travel plans.Nevertheless, the increase in international travel costs due to higher jet fuel could take a toll on the sector that is still in recovery mode from the COVID-19 triggered slowdown. According to Peter McNally of Third Bridge Global Sector lead for Industrials Materials and Energy, airplane capacity issues could become rampant as travel costs soar due to higher jet fuel costs.Some airlines have already started cutting guidance due to the higher fuel costs. For instance, American Airlines expects its Q3 earnings to range between $0.20 and $0.30 a share below the previous guidance of between $0.85 and $0.95. Amid the cuts, most airlines are expected to pass the elevated costs due to high fuel costs, labor issues, and strong dollar to customers owing to the high demand in the market.Waning travel demand is another issue that could batter the sector heading into year-end. Southwest Airlines has already embarked on aggressive marketing campaigns as it looks to get more people booking for its flights.The airline offers triple Companion Pass qualifying points per flight for people looking through its business channels. The easier way to earn the points signifies the ever-growing need to fill seats not just this year but into 2024.11 Best Airline Stocks to Invest In Right NowSource:pixabayDespite the concerns, the air travel industry remains on course to finish the year on a high as airlines continue charging premium fares. As the air travel industry continues to rebound from the pandemic slowdown and airlines report record revenues and profits, tremendous investment opportunities continue cropping up, with most airline stocks trading at highly discounted levels.The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which offers exposure to passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators, is flat for the year, signaling how investors have shunned the sector despite the solid fundamentals.Morningstar expects the operating environment in the US airline sector to continue improving and return to more normalized competitive dynamics once supply constraints moderate. Declining fuel costs in a consolidated industry and robust demand for air travel should offer the much-needed support.Our MethodologyWhile relentless travel demand has sent bookings in major US carriers soaring and leading to bumper earnings, the same is yet to reflect in stock valuations. Most stocks appear to be trading at great discounts, therefore offering a high-risk reward opportunity.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US stock market and recent developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now.The Two-Day Fed MeetingOn September 19, the US Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting, leaving investors in a state of anticipation over what to expect next. Some argue that the Fed is not likely to hike rates again, while others provide an alternative response. Regardless of which camp ends up being right about this matter, it is indisputable that the Fed's September decision will immensely impact the market and those who hold a stake in it, making this a topic of interest for major stakeholders across the country.CNBC's 'Halftime Report' discussed this topic on September 19. Josh Brown, the CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, was among the experts invited on CNBC to comment on the situation on the ground right now. Here's what he had to say:""If we do still have more hurdles, and even possibly more rate hikes, that's gonna come because of what's going on with oil and gasoline prices - my opinion. You do have the stickiness in wages, you may not have the same rate of inflation but wages aren't going back down. You have the same phenomenon in shelter, particularly in rentals. That's not going back down. That stickiness is with us.""Brown continued to discuss how WTI crude oil and gasoline prices are on the rise at the moment. He noted that historically, recessions have almost always been preceded by ""an oil price shock"" or a ""spike."" However, for him, the recent increases in oil prices are not at that level yet - they have merely moved up gradually. And this factor is why Brown does not believe that the Fed is done with its rate hikes just yet.Where Should Investors Put Their Money?Investors should keep in mind that, at the moment, the markets are still in an unpredictable phase. The fact that the Fed's September decision is also just on the horizon means that investors should be extra careful with where they put their money. Karen Firestone, the CEO of Aureus Asset Management and a renowned portfolio manager, made the following comments on CNBC's 'Halftime Report' with regards to portfolio management:Story continues""What I feel is most important is to have a portfolio that encompasses companies that are going to have earnings growth that's greater than expected. You know, we can start seeing some earnings accelerations. And I think this is the first time in quite a long time that estimates are moving higher.""Companies with high earnings growth can thus be good bets for many investors during the second half of the year. However, another cohort of stocks some should look into is that of beaten-down stocks that have recently hit their 52-week lows. If investors can find a few companies that have proven their worth historically in terms of earnings growth and other fundamentals but are struggling in the market at present, they can probably come up with a portfolio of stocks that are reliable for the future and that can be bought at a bargain right now. Some such stocks include Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). There are many others that we have mentioned in our list below as well. These include some of the best stocks to buy now in 2023 and some of the best growth stocks to buy now.13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to find stocks that had hit their 52-week lows around September 18 and then shortlisted 13 stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

Like much of the retail industry, they are contending with higher costs related to shrink as well as the mix of sales shifting away from higher margin areas towards lower margin categories like grocery. Despite the near-term disappointment, we remain optimistic that the company can improve its profit performance. New Chairman and CEO Richard Dreiling has completely overhauled the management team with an impressive roster of retail executives, and they are spearheading a great number of initiatives that should bear fruit over the coming years.”9.

The analyst also maintained a price target of $240 on the stock.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”Like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a stock that is popular among many institutional investors and hedge funds today.6.

The company offers apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes, among more.Holding 2.9 million shares in the company, Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of the second quarter.Diamond Hill Capital said the following about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now13 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy Now11 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To ConsiderDisclosure: None. 13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What's The Opportunity In Intuitive Surgical?The stock is currently trading at US$292 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 37% compared to my intrinsic value of $213.08. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Intuitive Surgical’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 75%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ISRG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing.

ISRG is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by solid first-half 2023 results and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further. Risks pertaining to procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 12.9% year to date against the industry’s 6.5% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 15.9% during the same time frame.Intuitive Surgical, the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery and the renowned provider of minimally invasive care, has a market capitalization of $104.78 billion. It projects 15.7% growth over the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance going forward.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 4.19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.On ISRG’s second-quarter 2023 earnings call, the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 13% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 9% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Story continuesPer management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply-chain management.Strong Q2 Results: ISRG’s solid second-quarter 2023 results also buoy our optimism. The company witnessed continued growth in its da Vinci procedure volume. Although COVID-19 cases adversely impacted its procedure volume in China during the quarter, the country plans to add 559 robotic systems in the coming years. Intuitive Surgical will provide some of these systems, mostly between 2024 and 2027. This will drive top-line growth significantly.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.Estimate TrendIntuitive Surgical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.9% north to $5.57 per share.The consensus mark for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, indicating a 13.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

With more than just competitive bragging rights involved, the technology sector has never been more crucial.As a recent Fortune article pointed out, the $574 billion U.S.-China chip war has already yielded an “extraordinary success” for the Biden administration. Specifically, the president’s stringent controls on the export of advanced semiconductors and associated systems to China carry national security implications. Even better, other partners – including the Dutch and Japanese – have come on board the export controls.With a unified effort against China, Beijing may think twice about its expansionary ambitions, especially regarding Taiwan. If the economic and military juggernaut backs off from its heated rhetorical stance, that would be great news for all involved but especially for semiconductor stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs well, the lessons from Covid-19 and even Russia’s invasion of Ukraine emphasized the importance of competitiveness and resiliency. Ultimately, this framework could usher in a new era for the below semiconductor stocks to buy.Lam Research (LRCX)Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockAn American supplier of wafer-fabrication equipment and related services to the computer chip industry, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) might not be the sexiest idea among semiconductor stocks to profit off the U.S.-China chip war. However, it could be one of the most important. Most notably, the Biden administration’s focus on bolstering the domestic chip manufacturing space should benefit domestic equipment suppliers like Lam.Another factor that may shine a positive light on LRCX stock is the tech sector’s replacement and upgrade cycle. As chips become more advanced, with nodes shrinking and perhaps incorporating new materials, a need for equipment upgrades and replacement will likely rise. Cynically, Lam Research would be in a position to benefit from such a trend.Story continuesTo be fair, LRCX has already gained nearly 59% of its equity value since the January opener. Moving forward, it may be a slow but steady ride. For now, Wall Street analysts peg LRCX as a moderate buy with a $699.86 price target, implying over 6% upside potential.Micron (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is a producer of computer memory and computer data storage, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and USB flash drives. Since the beginning of the year, MU returned nearly 41% of its equity value. Even with this solid performance, MU could potentially rise even further.While memory products might not sound that exciting to lay observers, MU represents one of the most important semiconductor stocks. Predominantly, memory chips are essential for smartphones and devices along with data centers. Further, as underlying processors become more complex, the demand for high-capacity memory chips will likely only accelerate.Even more importantly, artificial intelligence and machine learning can’t go anywhere without memory. It’s only by incorporating this special class of semiconductors that AI protocols become more refined. Lastly, analysts peg MU as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down into 20 buys, seven holds, and one sell. Overall, the average price target comes in at $75.72, implying 7% growth.KLA (KLAC)a KLA sign in a gardenSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a capital equipment firm. Per its public profile, it supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries. Further, KLA’s products and services are intended for all phases of wafer, reticle, integrated circuit, and packaging production, from research and development to final volume manufacturing.Fundamentally, KLA is one of the semiconductor stocks poised to benefit from the U.S.-China chip war due to supply chain diversification. Essentially, the company focuses on sophisticated inspections, a service that will probably only rise in demand. And with several countries joining in on the export controls against China, KLA might see an expansion of its total addressable market.Since the start of the year, KLAC has gained over 28% of its equity value. However, with tensions rising, it may enjoy even greater gains from here on out. Analysts certainly think so, with the experts pegging KLAC a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target is $541.05, implying nearly 12% growth potential.Analog Devices (ADI)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy nowSource: ShutterstockHailing from Wilmington, Massachusetts, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) specializes in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology. Per its corporate profile, Analog manufactures analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal-processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. Since the start of the year, ADI gained a bit over 8%, a relatively modest performance.Nevertheless, it could be one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy in the U.S.-China chip war. Fundamentally, Analog offers a wide-ranging application portfolio. Manufacturing products for several sectors, including automotive, communications, industrial, and healthcare, the tech enterprise could possibly weather economic storms. After all, one of these sectors could be irrelevant but not all.In addition, ADI benefits from generally positive options flow or big block trades in the derivatives market. On Sept. 13, traders sold (wrote) a high volume of $190 puts that expire two days later, implying a floor in the price action. Notably, analysts peg ADI as a moderate buy with a $200.73 price target, translating to 14% upside.ASML Holding (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockWhen the Dutch joined in on the export control, the top idea among semiconductor stocks that came to mind for practically everyone was ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML). Based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML is the only company manufacturing the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that help undergird advanced microchips that power data centers, cars, and smartphones, per CNBC.With ASML’s pivotal role in the U.S.-China chip war, business should be very good for the semiconductor specialist. Over the past one-year period, ASML stock gained just over 29% of equity value. While it’s not the best-performing name among semiconductor stocks, it practically holds a technological monopoly. That’s a plus for the free world. To be fair, ASML’s options flow screener shows big block trades for bought puts that expire on Sept. 15. But once these puts expire, it’s possible that we may see a bounce back from shares.Analysts remain unperturbed, pegging ASML as a moderate buy with a $200.73 price target, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.comWith the meteoric rise of graphics processing units, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) would make a consensus inclusion for semiconductor stocks to buy. However, after already soaring nearly 220% since the start of the year, it may be time to give it a break. Instead, I’ll take the time to put a spotlight on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).As a rival GPU specialist, Advanced Micro should benefit from the same tailwinds that skyrocketed shares of Nvidia. And to be clear, AMD is no slouch in the chart performance department. Since the January opener, shares swung up more than 68%. It’s not a flukey print either, with AMD gaining 39% in the past 365 days.Increasingly, advanced tech such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) consumes greater amounts of processing capacity. Thus, AMD should see robust demand, if only to fill orders that Nvidia couldn’t. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AMD as a strong buy with a $140.58 price target, implying almost 31% upside potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comOne of the most compelling semiconductor stocks, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) also represents an incredibly risky proposition. Of course, I’m not just referring to the context of the U.S.-China chip war. For years, ominous clouds pointed to Beijing giving the green light to invade Taiwan. Without sounding alarmist, such an action would likely trigger World War III.At first blush, the notion may sound ridiculous. However, TSMC as it’s known is the world’s largest contract chipmaker. It also produces around 90% of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors that are useful for AI and quantum computing applications, per a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. If an authoritarian regime controlled that supply chain exclusively, we would all be in deep trouble.Still, by imposing export controls now, the U.S. and its partners are sending a strong message before circumstances get hot. And that might cause Beijing to reconsider, which would be good for TSM stock. Finally, analysts peg TSM as a moderate buy with a $125 price target, implying 37% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

And Regions, which has a rich history with the organization, played a significant role at the Houston gathering in highlighting a shared priority: supporting and advancing Black-owned businesses.""Small and minority-owned businesses are important drivers for our local economies - in small towns, rural communities and large metropolitan areas,"" according to Leroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs at Regions Bank.""At Regions, we understand how critical it is for these businesses to flourish, and teams across the bank work to serve, support and provide resources to ensure their success and continue to create more inclusive economic development in our communities.""Abrahams was on hand for the National Urban League conference, along with Latrisha Jemison, Regional Community Development Manager and other members of Community Affairs. They were joined by a team of Regions bankers who participated in a panel discussion at the Small Business Matters Entrepreneurship Summit.""The National Urban League Conference is one of our most important events of the year,"" Jemison said. ""And being able to engage with Black business owners and entrepreneurs and provide advice and guidance to them was a great opportunity for us.""Small and minority-owned businesses are important drivers for our local economies - in small towns, rural communities and large metropolitan areasStory continuesLeroy Abrahams, head of Community Affairs at Regions BankSupporting and Elevating BusinessesThe discussion was led by Chad Cargile, Commercial Banking leader at Regions, and focused on a very timely topic: rising interest rates and the special challenges experienced by small business owners.""Our Regions Bank team is incredibly proud to welcome the National Urban League Annual Conference to Houston,"" Cargile said as he opened the discussion.""Regions is committed to supporting and elevating small businesses, particularly in under-resourced communities, to help advance their growth. We know that every entrepreneur's journey is different, meaning every small-business owner has different needs.""Cargile then introduced the panel, which included Carl Brown, Regions branch manager; Shawntay Johnson, Regions Commercial Banking relationship manager; Eric Goodie, senior vice president of the Houston Area Urban League; and Phillip Yates, co-founder of Diversity Fund Houston and founder of EQUILIBERTY, INC.The group talked about the challenges small businesses are facing with rising interest rates - from each of their unique vantage points. They provided tips, tools and resources - and also discussed how an unpredictable rate environment can actually introduce opportunities.Regions bankers Brown and Johnson spoke about the importance of relationships and how critical it is to have ongoing dialog during challenging economic times.""Transparency and trust are key,"" Johnson told the audience. ""Make sure your banker is aware of your goals, your other banking relationships and any other information that can assist when you're working together to identify solutions.""The team received positive feedback about the session, and the Regions bankers were available after the discussion to spend extra time with audience members for additional one-on-one advice about their small-business needs.In addition to the Small Business Matters Entrepreneurship Summit, Regions associates were also involved in the NUL conference's Community Day event and other programs.""The National Urban League has been advocating for economic justice for African Americans for more than 100 years,"" Jemison said. ""I'm pleased that we can work together toward common goals - such as providing support for Black-owned businesses. And I look forward to continuing this relationship for many years to come.""This short video, which highlights some examples of Regions' support of Black-owned business, was shown at the National Urban League Conference.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/785907/ensuring-small-business-matters]"

V recently teamed up with the leading financial messaging services provider, Swift, in a bid to boost connectivity between the partners’ networks and therefore, ease international business-to-business (B2B) payments. For getting access to Swift’s network, messaging services, standards and solutions, Visa will make use of a scalable and safe cloud-based channel, Alliance Cloud.Swift Payment Pre-validation, one of Swift’s capabilities, will pave the way for the prompt scrutiny of Visa B2B Connect payments. This, in turn, detects potential errors before the initiation of payments and thereby, minimizes unwarranted delays. In addition to this, Swift GPI capabilities and tracking data will be made use of by both the networks to ensure enhanced end-to-end speed and transparency of transactions. The resultant benefit of the latest tie-up will be reaped by financial institution clients of both the networks, who will be equipped to provide increased routing choices for their business customers. Therefore, the ulterior motive of the partnership remains to make cross-border money transfers easier, safer and quicker. Infusing the correct standards of security, resiliency, reliability and compliance within the financial infrastructure of the world remains a mutual motive of both Visa and Swift, which will be addressed by the partnership. The latest move bears testament to Visa’s efforts to bolster the offerings suite that its financial institutions clients extend to their corporate customers. Portfolio upgradation often results in attracting new customers and the likewise may happen with Visa. Through the enhancement of global payment processes, Visa seeks to establish a solid footprint in the worldwide cross-border payments market and targets to alleviate some of the intricacies that often crops up in moving money across borders.And a booming digital era compels businesses to transform their business models and increasingly adopt digital means while making international payments. This, in turn, sustains the solid demand for convenient and affordable digital cross-border payment solutions, on which Visa can capitalize on through partnerships similar to the latest one.Story continuesSwift, powered by a superior infrastructure, which seamlessly interconnects geographies, networks and technologies, seems to be the apt partner to complement Visa’s endeavor of upgrading cross-border payments. Swift safely interconnects more than 11,500 institutions spread across 200 plus countries and territories.Shares of Visa have gained 30.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 22.1% growth.

223,f50f1493-f66c-3702-bdfd-15d6820eda7b,NWSA,2023-09-21,Realtor.com® August Rental Report: Renting Beats Buying in All but Three of the Largest U.S. Metros,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-august-rental-report-100000644.html,1695290400,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Buying a starter home in the top 50 metros cost $1,111 (60.3%) more than renting in August, as median U.S. rents see fourth consecutive month of year-over-year declinesSANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The elevated mortgage rates, steep home prices and declining rent costs familiar in today's housing market have made it less costly to rent than to buy a starter home in all but three of the largest metros in the U.S., according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Rental Report released today. In August 2023, the cost of buying a starter home in the top 50 metros was $1,111 (60.3%) higher than renting in those markets on average.""Rents have registered steady declines for the past four months and, while they remain well above pre-pandemic levels, when you factor in the impact of record-high mortgage rates and high home prices, it's understandable that many would-be homebuyers are choosing to remain on the sidelines,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""The downward trend in rental prices reduces the sense of urgency, giving renters more time to save for a home. In the period ahead as rents soften, we expect more households will remain renters for longer.""August 2023 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentRent YoYRent Change - 4 yearsOverall$1,752-0.6 %23.7 %Studio$1,463-0.2 %18.4 %1-bed$1,634-0.5 %23.6 %2-bed$1,948-0.7 %26.4 %Nationally, rents drop for fourth straight month, while homebuying costs increaseMedian rents for 0-2 bedroom units declined consistently year-over-year for the past four months which, when combined with mortgage rates hovering above 7% and a low enough supply to drive prices up despite subdued demand, tipped the scales further in favor of renting. In August, homeownership costs exceeded renters' monthly costs by nearly $300 compared with the start of the year.August marked the fourth month of year-over-year rent declines in a row for 0-2 bedroom properties, which overall are down -0.6% year-over-year. Rents dropped -0.7% for 2-bedrooms, -0.5% for 1-bedrooms, and -0.2% for studios.Specifically, the median asking rent in the 50 largest metros dipped to $1,752, down $7 from last month and down $25 from the peak in July 2022. However, median rents remain $336 (23.7%) higher than the same time in 2019, prior to the pandemic.In the majority of the largest U.S. metros, though, renting a starter home remains more affordable than buying one. During the past 12 months, with an average 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumping from 5.22% to 7.07%, the cost to buy a starter home in markets that favor renting climbed at an average rate of 21.4%, increasing from $2,500 to $2,959.Story continuesRenting beats buying in nearly all major metros, and the advantage is increasingIn August, renting was more affordable than buying a starter home in 47 of the 50 largest metros, up from 45 during the same time last year. Declining rents and the increasing costs of buying a home contributed to the jump in savings from renting. While skyrocketing mortgage rates pushed up the cost of taking on a mortgage, climbing home prices expanded the base of mortgages as well, making buying even less affordable compared to renting. The advantage of renting continues to grow in all rent-favoring markets.In the top 10 metros that favor renting over buying, most of which have a higher concentration of tech workers and high earners, both the average cost to rent and to buy are higher than the national average. Austin, Texas topped the list of markets that favor renting, where the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $3,946 – 136.3% more than the monthly rent – for a monthly savings of $2,276. Meanwhile, Baltimore and St. Louis flipped from buy-favoring to rent-favoring markets during the past 12 months.In August 2023, the monthly savings in rent-favoring markets were $483 higher compared to the prior year.The median asking rent declined -0.5% year-over-year in rent-favoring markets, a trend significantly different from 12 months ago. In these markets, the monthly cost of buying a starter home in August 2023 was $2,959, which is $1,183 or an average of 64.3% higher than the cost of renting. Comparatively, in August 2022 buying a starter home in rent-favoring markets cost an additional $700 (36.2%) more than renting.San Jose saw the most substantial surge in savings when comparing renting and buying. In August 2023, renting a starter home in San Jose yielded monthly savings of $3,214, a significant increase from the $1,964 saved last year. Indianapolis, however, saw the largest percentage increase in savings from renting. In August 2023, renting a starter home in Indianapolis would save renters $431 compared to buying, ten times the savings seen 12 months ago ($43).In markets favoring buying, the advantage is shrinkingIn August 2023, only three of the top 50 U.S. metros favored buying starter homes rather than renting: Birmingham, Ala., Memphis, Tenn., and Pittsburgh; however, the cost-benefits of buying have decreased since the same time last year.In buy-favoring markets, the monthly cost of buying a starter home was $29 cheaper on average, or -2.1% lower than the cost of renting, a significant decrease from the savings of $192 in the same time last year.In particular, the savings from buying a starter home instead of renting dropped from $434 to $43 in Memphis, $282 to $6 in Birmingham, and $139 to $39 in Pittsburgh over the past 12 months.As the benefit of buying diminishes in these markets, prospective homebuyers will need to consider all trade offs when deciding whether to buy or continue renting. This is particularly important given that today's elevated mortgage rates and still-high home prices pose substantial challenges for would-be buyers. To help homebuyers better understand their options, as part of its RealCost set of tools, Realtor.com® offers a free rent or buy calculator, which estimates how long a new homebuyer would need to remain in their home for buying to make more financial sense than renting.""As we noted in our July Rental Trends report, seasonality and recent momentum in the rental market make it very unlikely the market will see a new peak rent in 2023,"" said Jiayi Xu, Economist at Realtor.com®. ""Still, rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to ongoing affordability concerns for renters, regardless of whether they plan to rent or buy in the months ahead.""Top 10 Metros that Favor Renting over Buying in August 2023 MetroMedian RentMonthly Buy Cost$ Difference (Buy-Rent)% Difference (Buy-Rent)Rent YYBuy Cost YYAustin-Round Rock-Georgetown, TX$1,670$3,946$2,276136.3 %-8.0 %9.2 %San Francisco- Oakland-Berkeley, CA$2,906$5,859$2,953101.6 %-4.9 %12.7 %Columbus, OH$1,222$2,458$1,236101.1 %2.7 %35.1 %Sacramento-Roseville- Folsom, CA$1,898$3,779$1,88199.1 %-3.9 %29.9 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA$2,892$5,672$2,78096.1 %-2.3 %23.3 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA$3,367$6,581$3,21495.5 %-0.2 %23.3 %Portland-Vancouver- Hillsboro, OR-WA$1,709$3,314$1,60593.9 %-5.2 %13.8 %Boston-Cambridge- Newton, MA-NH$2,851$5,526$2,67593.8 %3.2 %24.4 %Seattle-Tacoma- Bellevue, WA$2,168$4,156$1,98891.7 %-3.7 %21.0 %Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, AZ$1,595$3,015$1,42089.0 %-4.5 %17.7 % Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – August 2023MetroMedian Rent (0-2 Bedrooms)YOY (0-2 Bedrooms)Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA$1,698-4.0 %Austin-Round Rock, TX$1,670-8.0 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD$1,8693.2 %Birmingham-Hoover, AL$1,2693.0 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH$2,8513.2 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, NYNANACharlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC$1,607-1.9 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI$1,8050.5 %Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN$1,2566.2 %Cleveland-Elyria, OH$1,2722.7 %Columbus, OH$1,2222.7 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX$1,535-5.4 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO$1,990-1.0 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI$1,2703.3 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CTNANAHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX$1,4061.1 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN$1,3253.9 %Jacksonville, FL$1,5262.2 %Kansas City, MO-KS$1,2881.6 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV$1,526-4.6 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA$2,892-2.3 %Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN$1,2144.4 %Memphis, TN-MS-AR$1,328-2.5 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL$2,511-0.7 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI$1,5744.3 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI$1,5151.4 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, TN$1,665-0.2 %New Orleans-Metairie, LANANANew York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA$3,0976.5 %Oklahoma City, OK$1,0143.4 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL$1,747-4.8 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD$1,826-0.1 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ$1,595-4.5 %Pittsburgh, PA$1,5293.4 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA$1,709-5.2 %Providence-Warwick, RI-MANANARaleigh, NC$1,587-5.4 %Richmond, VA$1,5255.9 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA$2,190-4.8 %Rochester, NYNANASacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, CA$1,898-3.9 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX$1,281-2.0 %San Diego-Carlsbad, CA$2,944-0.2 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA$2,906-4.9 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA$3,367-0.2 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA$2,168-3.7 %St. Louis, MO-IL$1,3041.9 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL$1,711-5.5 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC$1,4641.1 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria,DC-VA-MD-WV$2,2664.9 % MethodologyRental data as of August for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®. Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes). We use rental sources that reliably report data each month within the top 50 largest metropolitan areas. Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.The monthly cost of buying a home was calculated by averaging the median listing prices of studio, 1-bed, and 2-bed homes, weighted by the number of listings, in each housing market. Monthly buying costs assume a 7% down payment, with a mortgage rate of 7.07%, and include taxes, insurance and HOA fees.With the release of its July rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since July 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts. However, future data releases, including historical data, will consistently apply the new methodology.About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

224,f278a7ee-02f3-3216-af25-d8263d8c4fec,KLAC,2023-09-21,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for a U.S.-China Chip War,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-semiconductor-stocks-buy-u-175719972.html,1694714239,STORY,"['LRCX', 'ASML', 'ADI', 'AMD', 'KLAC', 'MU']","[Although geopolitical conflicts between major economic powers are generally something to be avoided, for semiconductor stocks trading amid the backdrop of the U.S.-China chip war, the bad news just might be good news. With more than just competitive bragging rights involved, the technology sector has never been more crucial.As a recent Fortune article pointed out, the $574 billion U.S.-China chip war has already yielded an “extraordinary success” for the Biden administration. Specifically, the president’s stringent controls on the export of advanced semiconductors and associated systems to China carry national security implications. Even better, other partners – including the Dutch and Japanese – have come on board the export controls.With a unified effort against China, Beijing may think twice about its expansionary ambitions, especially regarding Taiwan. If the economic and military juggernaut backs off from its heated rhetorical stance, that would be great news for all involved but especially for semiconductor stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs well, the lessons from Covid-19 and even Russia’s invasion of Ukraine emphasized the importance of competitiveness and resiliency. Ultimately, this framework could usher in a new era for the below semiconductor stocks to buy.Lam Research (LRCX)Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockAn American supplier of wafer-fabrication equipment and related services to the computer chip industry, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) might not be the sexiest idea among semiconductor stocks to profit off the U.S.-China chip war. However, it could be one of the most important. Most notably, the Biden administration’s focus on bolstering the domestic chip manufacturing space should benefit domestic equipment suppliers like Lam.Another factor that may shine a positive light on LRCX stock is the tech sector’s replacement and upgrade cycle. As chips become more advanced, with nodes shrinking and perhaps incorporating new materials, a need for equipment upgrades and replacement will likely rise. Cynically, Lam Research would be in a position to benefit from such a trend.Story continuesTo be fair, LRCX has already gained nearly 59% of its equity value since the January opener. Moving forward, it may be a slow but steady ride. For now, Wall Street analysts peg LRCX as a moderate buy with a $699.86 price target, implying over 6% upside potential.Micron (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comBased in Boise, Idaho, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is a producer of computer memory and computer data storage, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and USB flash drives. Since the beginning of the year, MU returned nearly 41% of its equity value. Even with this solid performance, MU could potentially rise even further.While memory products might not sound that exciting to lay observers, MU represents one of the most important semiconductor stocks. Predominantly, memory chips are essential for smartphones and devices along with data centers. Further, as underlying processors become more complex, the demand for high-capacity memory chips will likely only accelerate.Even more importantly, artificial intelligence and machine learning can’t go anywhere without memory. It’s only by incorporating this special class of semiconductors that AI protocols become more refined. Lastly, analysts peg MU as a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down into 20 buys, seven holds, and one sell. Overall, the average price target comes in at $75.72, implying 7% growth.KLA (KLAC)a KLA sign in a gardenSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a capital equipment firm. Per its public profile, it supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries. Further, KLA’s products and services are intended for all phases of wafer, reticle, integrated circuit, and packaging production, from research and development to final volume manufacturing.Fundamentally, KLA is one of the semiconductor stocks poised to benefit from the U.S.-China chip war due to supply chain diversification. Essentially, the company focuses on sophisticated inspections, a service that will probably only rise in demand. And with several countries joining in on the export controls against China, KLA might see an expansion of its total addressable market.Since the start of the year, KLAC has gained over 28% of its equity value. However, with tensions rising, it may enjoy even greater gains from here on out. Analysts certainly think so, with the experts pegging KLAC a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target is $541.05, implying nearly 12% growth potential.Analog Devices (ADI)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy nowSource: ShutterstockHailing from Wilmington, Massachusetts, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) specializes in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technology. Per its corporate profile, Analog manufactures analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal-processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. Since the start of the year, ADI gained a bit over 8%, a relatively modest performance.Nevertheless, it could be one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy in the U.S.-China chip war. Fundamentally, Analog offers a wide-ranging application portfolio. Manufacturing products for several sectors, including automotive, communications, industrial, and healthcare, the tech enterprise could possibly weather economic storms. After all, one of these sectors could be irrelevant but not all.In addition, ADI benefits from generally positive options flow or big block trades in the derivatives market. On Sept. 13, traders sold (wrote) a high volume of $190 puts that expire two days later, implying a floor in the price action. Notably, analysts peg ADI as a moderate buy with a $200.73 price target, translating to 14% upside.ASML Holding (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockWhen the Dutch joined in on the export control, the top idea among semiconductor stocks that came to mind for practically everyone was ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML). Based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML is the only company manufacturing the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that help undergird advanced microchips that power data centers, cars, and smartphones, per CNBC.With ASML’s pivotal role in the U.S.-China chip war, business should be very good for the semiconductor specialist. Over the past one-year period, ASML stock gained just over 29% of equity value. While it’s not the best-performing name among semiconductor stocks, it practically holds a technological monopoly. That’s a plus for the free world. To be fair, ASML’s options flow screener shows big block trades for bought puts that expire on Sept. 15. But once these puts expire, it’s possible that we may see a bounce back from shares.Analysts remain unperturbed, pegging ASML as a moderate buy with a $200.73 price target, implying nearly 14% upside potential.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.comWith the meteoric rise of graphics processing units, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) would make a consensus inclusion for semiconductor stocks to buy. However, after already soaring nearly 220% since the start of the year, it may be time to give it a break. Instead, I’ll take the time to put a spotlight on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).As a rival GPU specialist, Advanced Micro should benefit from the same tailwinds that skyrocketed shares of Nvidia. And to be clear, AMD is no slouch in the chart performance department. Since the January opener, shares swung up more than 68%. It’s not a flukey print either, with AMD gaining 39% in the past 365 days.Increasingly, advanced tech such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) consumes greater amounts of processing capacity. Thus, AMD should see robust demand, if only to fill orders that Nvidia couldn’t. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AMD as a strong buy with a $140.58 price target, implying almost 31% upside potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comOne of the most compelling semiconductor stocks, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) also represents an incredibly risky proposition. Of course, I’m not just referring to the context of the U.S.-China chip war. For years, ominous clouds pointed to Beijing giving the green light to invade Taiwan. Without sounding alarmist, such an action would likely trigger World War III.At first blush, the notion may sound ridiculous. However, TSMC as it’s known is the world’s largest contract chipmaker. It also produces around 90% of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors that are useful for AI and quantum computing applications, per a report from the Council on Foreign Relations. If an authoritarian regime controlled that supply chain exclusively, we would all be in deep trouble.Still, by imposing export controls now, the U.S. and its partners are sending a strong message before circumstances get hot. And that might cause Beijing to reconsider, which would be good for TSM stock. Finally, analysts peg TSM as a moderate buy with a $125 price target, implying 37% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, U.S. stock markets lost momentum over the past one-and-a half months. Market participants are uncertain about the Fed’s future move on monetary policies. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted two consecutive weeks of decline.At present, the CME FedWatch is showing a 99% probability that the central bank will keep the interest rate unchanged at the existing rate of 5.25-5.5% in its FOMC meeting, which started on Sep 19. Notably, this is the highest Fed fund rate since March 2001.However, there exists a 29% probability that the benchmark interest rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points or more in the November FOMC meeting. In this regard, the post-FOMC meeting statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, to be delivered at 2 PM on Sep 20, will have immense importance.Stocks to WatchSeptember is historically known as the worst-performing month on Wall Street. At this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Cash Cow Stocks to Buy NowThe appeal for cash cows has been on the rise in recent weeks, given the current stock market volatility and uncertainty. Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Amazon.com, Verizon Communications, McKesson Corporation (MCK) and D.R. Horton Inc.. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Story continuesStrong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Current Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors' sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don't cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024). Procter &amp; Gamble has a Zacks Rank #2.Amazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. It has a market cap of $1.5 billion and has an estimated earnings growth of 214.1%.Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.Verizon offers communication services in the form of local phone service, long-distance, wireless and data services. The company is expected to post an earnings decline of 8.7% for this year.With a market cap of $142 billion, Verizon has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company.

It deepened the slump from July’s 9% drop, leading to a 7.5% fall for the year so far, mirroring a prolonged decline in sales of smartphones, laptops and other personal electronics that’s lasted since last year.The surge in demand for artificial intelligence hardware has boosted the fortunes of companies like Quanta Computer Inc., which assembles data center servers and saw its shares rocket to all-time highs this summer. As a major partner of Nvidia Corp., Quanta is seen as a beneficiary of the US chipmaker’s runaway sales of AI accelerators, though those growing orders may take a while to translate into sales — Quanta’s cloud unit expects to double AI server sales next year.Read more: Nvidia Partner Expects AI Server Sales to Double in 2024Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, is the exclusive supplier of Nvidia’s AI chips and Apple’s bespoke Silicon processors for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang visited four cities, dined with tech executives and researchers, took numerous selfies, and sat for a one-on-one conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the AI sector. Huang’s India itinerary was so crammed that he confessed to surviving entire work days on spicy masala omelets and cold coffees.Most Read from BloombergDimon Warns 7% Fed Rate Still Possible, Times of India SaysRepublican Moderates Turn to Rare Maneuver to Avoid Lengthy Government ShutdownIndians Have Five Days to Deposit $3 Billion in Soon-to-Be-Withdrawn BanknotesStocks Sink as Bears Take Charge, Dollar Rallies: Markets WrapTrump Found Liable for Fraud in New York Attorney General’s CaseHuang may have been treated like a head of state, but the trip’s purpose was all business. For Nvidia, whose graphics processors are vital to the development of artificial intelligence systems, the South Asian nation of 1.4 billion people presents a rare opportunity. As the US increasingly clamps down on exports of high-end chips to China and the world seeks an alternative electronics manufacturing base, India could shape up to be a source of AI talent, site for chip production and market for Nvidia’s products.At a meeting with leading researchers in Delhi, Huang spoke of re-training entire swaths of the country’s workforce and building future AI models using Indian data and talent, according to multiple attendees. Huang also told one executive in India’s tech hub Bangalore that he’s a big believer in the country’s engineering talent, particularly graduates from its top engineering schools, Indian Institutes of Technology.“You have the data, you have the talent,” Huang said at a news conference in Bangalore. Huang added: “This is going to be one of the largest AI markets in the world.”Nvidia and India have a shared interest in betting on, and speeding up, the country’s AI ascendancy. Chipmakers cannot sell top-end microprocessors to China, which accounts for a fifth of Nvidia’s sales, amid fears the chips could be used to develop autonomous weaponry or wage cyberwarfare. “India is the only market remaining so it isn’t surprising that Nvidia wants to put multiple eggs in that basket,” said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.While Indian engineers are a vital part of the digital workforce, the country is still far away from developing the cutting-edge capabilities needed to manufacture Nvidia’s sophisticated chips. But India has ambitions to boost electronics manufacturing as well as harness AI to buoy its digital economy. The country is plowing billions in subsidies to set up chip manufacturing infrastructure to lure the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp.Story continues“India is strategic to Nvidia’s future,” said Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Ltd. and a designer of vital portions of the country’s massive digital public infrastructure. “The government is aggressively building AI infrastructure and so are large private companies. That’s good news for Huang,” said Nilekani, who dined with the chip billionaire during the visit.In Delhi, the Taiwanese-American billionaire showed up at the prime minister’s residence in his trademark black leather jacket, braving sweltering 90-plus-degree summer temperatures. Modi later shared that the two talked about “the rich potential India offers in the world of AI.”Huang and Nvidia saw signs of that potential during the trip. India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced during Huang’s multi-city tour that its Jio Platforms would build AI computing infrastructure for the country. The AI cloud will use end-to-end Nvidia supercomputing technologies, the company said in a release. Reliance and another large conglomerate, Tata, will also build and operate state-of-the-art AI supercomputing data centers and offer AI infrastructure as a service for use by researchers, corporations and startups, Nvidia said, without giving details or sharing timelines.India has had reasonable success in enticing giants Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to shift contract electronics manufacturing from China — to a point where, this month, Apple will sell India-made iPhone 15 devices on launch day. Now it’s turning to semiconductors, armed with some experience in chip design and no history whatsoever in semiconductor foundries. Nearly all cutting-edge chips, including those designed by Nvidia, are made in Taiwan. Over several decades, the country spent billions to reach current levels of manufacturing sophistication.India wants to catch up, but it faces challenges turning itself into an AI hub. The country currently has no exascale compute capacity — being able to handle a billion billion calculations per second — nor the ready AI talent capable of writing sophisticated software, said Sashikumaar Ganesan, who chairs the computational and data sciences department at Indian Institute of Science. “We have to build not just AI infrastructure but also high-performance computing workforce,” said Ganesan, who was among those invited to Huang’s meeting with AI researchers.Still, India is a fast-maturing market for high-end technologies, said K. Krishna Moorthy, CEO of trade group India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. That’s created huge demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. “As India’s digital economy grows, the government is mandating data security, data privacy and data localization, and this could require over 100,000 GPUs to build AI cloud infrastructure,” Moorthy said.The country has telecom giants like Reliance’s Jio which collect billions of data points daily from its half a billion mobile users and hundreds of millions of retailers. “The data generated from 1.4 billion Indians could set the country up for the next phase of digital growth,” said Moorthy. “Huang understands this is where the next phase of growth for AI-enabling chips will happen.”Nvidia already has four engineering centers in India, including in Bangalore and in the Gurgaon suburbs of Delhi, with a total of 4,000 engineers, its second-biggest talent pool after the US. During his trip, Huang held town halls at each of the locations and stressed the importance of remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving AI marketplace. While speaking to employees, he repeated a line he’s used in public before, offering his twist on the hunt-or-be-hunted adage: Either you are running for food or running away from being food.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekPrivate Equity’s Slow Carnage Unleashes a Wave of ZombiesWhy Retiring in India No Longer Requires Living With the KidsWho’s Afraid of $100 Oil?Why Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in AmericaThe Fed’s Dream of a Soft Landing Is Facing a Triple Threat©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Cash Cow Stocks to Buy NowThe appeal for cash cows has been on the rise in recent weeks, given the current stock market volatility and uncertainty. Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Amazon.com, Verizon Communications, McKesson Corporation (MCK) and D.R. Horton Inc.. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Story continuesStrong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Current Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors' sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don't cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

Shares of Netflix, Amazon and Comcast returned 34.4%, 63.8% and 30.8%, respectively.Stiff competition from Comcast in the theme park business is hurting Disney’s prospects. DIS has suffered from the underwhelming performance of its streaming business, Disney+ due to intensified competition from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Comcast’s Peacock. Moreover, the disappointing theatrical release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Elemental also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Disney’s focus on sports streaming, particularly Live Sports on ESPN+, is expected to attract more subscribers. The renewal of the MLB sports rights deal through 2028 and the agreement with Spanish club football’s first division, La Liga, further strengthened the portfolio of the company’s sports content.

Shares were up about 0.6% on Wednesday.""Expanding parks and cruises tends to be a multi year undertaking as a result of which, revenue and margin acceleration lags the investment cycle,"" Barclays analysts said.""The struggle for investors may be to match their investment horizon with the return horizon of the company's plan.""Analysts said investors were also disappointed with a lack of updates on acquisition target ABC networks, the upcoming talks with Comcast on Hulu and the Hollywood strikes.The bump in parks spending also follows a quiet period for the business during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, when the spread of COVID-19 forced park closures and hit attendance.The business rebounded strongly post-pandemic to become the company's main profit engine but has shown signs of a slowdown in footfalls recently.That led Needham analysts to warn Disney could be basing its decision on ""unsustainable and elevated profit margins.""Still, the spending could help Disney fight off rivals that are expanding their U.S. presence with the recently opened Universal's Super Nintendo World in California and the upcoming Epic Universe in Florida in 2025.""Disney will likely face more competition and some of this investment may also be intended to deal with this competitive backdrop,"" Barclays said.(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

The kits stem from the organization's mission of making eating well easier while ensuring its neighbors have the help they need preparing their ingredients.TCG's program has been vetted and approved by Harvard Law School's Food Law and Policy Clinic as compliant with SNAP regulations.Throughout the Philadelphia region, more than 200,000 people are considered food-insecure, with inconsistent access to affordable, healthy food. Philadelphia follows national trends with children and people of color experiencing food insecurity at a higher rate than others.""Giving back isn't just an option, it's a responsibility,"" said Dominique Goss, executive director of M&amp;T's Charitable Foundation. ""Partnering with a nonprofit that tackles food insecurity allows us to create a stronger, more equitable community, ensuring our neighbors and those we serve have access to the food their families need, as well as resources that pave a path toward a brighter future.""Story continuesAlexandre Imbot, TCG's CEO and co-founder, said: ""TCG is providing education from soil to supper, promoting sustainability in a country where nearly 40% of food is wasted, and challenging the food systems that leave entire neighborhoods without access to fresh, affordable, and culturally relevant food.""In addition to the first-of-its-kind corner store located at 627 S. 60th Street, TCG's space will serve as a resource center for community programming and support. As a community-focused bank whose existing charitable priorities align with TCG's, M&amp;T will provide not only startup funding but also access to the resources and guidance community members need to meet their financial and business goals.Brandon Smith, M&amp;T's head of consumer operations and risk, will serve on TCG's board of directors and work with M&amp;T volunteers to host free financial education workshops for clients and community members within the resource center.""Regardless of someone's level of financial education, we meet them where they are,"" Smith said. ""By leading community workshops, our goal is to equip our neighbors with the skills and understanding needed to establish a secure financial future, unlocking the potential for stronger communities.""Financing for the refurbishment of TCG's Philadelphia location was provided by Community First Fund (CFF), a Philadelphia-based nonprofit partner of M&amp;T Bank. CFF is a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) dedicated to aligning capital with social justice for low-income communities and low-wealth individuals.The Community Grocer also has backing and support from The University of Pennsylvania, the FMC Corp., and in-kind support from Ballard Spahr and Stokes Architecture and Design.""TCG's commitments are to our neighbors and the positive impact we have in our community,"" said Eli Moraru, TCG's president and co-founder.

The meeting, aimed at devising a unified strategy for a systematic energy transition, comes as Europe grapples with rising energy prices and a shift towards renewable sources.The urgency of this conference is underscored by Europe's vulnerability to energy price shocks, which became apparent when Russia invaded Ukraine. This geopolitical event led to sanctions and a subsequent surge in oil and gas prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude benchmarks are currently around $90 per barrel, with some analysts predicting the price could reach $100 or more. Diesel prices have risen above $140 in the US and surged by 60% since summer in Europe.These soaring energy costs are threatening the competitiveness of European industries. Input costs across the region, including the EU and the UK, have surged beyond those of other developed economies like Japan, the US, and Canada. The Economist Intelligence Unit noted in October 2022 that high energy prices could result in a higher debt burden, business failures, and alterations to the green transition.This situation is further complicated by the absence of an industrial policy in Europe that matches those of the US, China, Korea, or Japan. This deficiency is most pronounced in the energy sector as Europe attempts to transition to green energy while simultaneously dealing with the crisis in Ukraine.Securing affordable supplies of critical minerals for clean energy supply chains and fuels is crucial for Europe's strategic approach. However, political factors have so far hindered this goal. For instance, negotiations between the EU and Mercosur – an alliance of South American countries including Brazil and Argentina – have been stalled since 2019 due to fears among French farmers about competition from these agricultural powerhouses.Story continuesPolitical tension in Francophone Africa is also creating obstacles. Western Africa has experienced a series of military takeovers since 2020, characterized by strong anti-French and anti-European sentiment. While some corporations insist that business will continue as usual, it remains uncertain whether Brussels can negotiate beneficial agreements with such regimes.As autumn progresses, the focus will be on whether Europe can develop a comprehensive energy strategy to alleviate the uncertainty facing businesses and the general public. Moreover, with winter approaching, it remains to be seen if Europe is prepared for another potential energy price shock or whether further scrambling will exacerbate input costs. The readiness of a plan to reassure Europeans will be closely watched.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The decision by the US Fed sustains the rate gap between South Korea and the US at up to 2 percentage points, with the Bank of Korea's current base rate standing at 3.5%.Minister Choo's comments came during a meeting with Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong and other financial officials. He noted that despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's statement that the Fed will consider economic and financial circumstances in determining monetary policy, Powell did not discard the possibility of future rate hikes, suggesting restrictive rates will be maintained until inflation eases.The median forecasts released on Thursday indicate that Fed officials still see a need for one more quarter-point interest rate hike before the end of this year. In response, the Bank of Korea has pledged to closely monitor the situation. Deputy Governor Lee Seung-heon expressed concern about rising international oil prices, which reached annual highs earlier this week due to production cuts from major oil producers, potentially adding further inflationary pressure on the economy.Inflation in Korea has been rebounding, with consumer prices growing by 3.4% in August year-on-year, exceeding expectations. This follows a slow day in Korea’s financial market on Thursday, with the benchmark Kospi opening lower than the previous trading day, and the Korean won weakening against the US dollar.The Bank of Korea is scheduled to hold its next rate-setting meeting on Oct. 19. As the Fed signals an extended period of high rates, market watchers anticipate a hawkish tone from the Bank of Korea, despite Governor Rhee's insistence that Korea does not have to ""mechanically"" follow the Fed's rate decision.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

CL has been witnessing near-term headwinds related to rising raw and packaging material costs, as well as additional pricing. The incremental pricing actions have been affecting volume trends, which are likely to continue in the near term. Also, the company anticipates a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half of the year.Although the company noted that there has been a gradual recovery in cost inflation across many regions, countries like Turkey, Argentina and Pakistan continue to witness high inflation.These factors are expected to continue posing an uncertain macro environment for the company, thus, hurting sentiment. The effects of these concerns are well evident from the company’s recent price performance.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 5.6% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 0.7%. The company’s shares have also underperformed the sector’s decline of 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 1% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Can Innovation Plans Aid?Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the recent relaunch of the Soupline business in France and the launch of Suavitel — the Soupline Hearts. The company is on track with the relaunch of Sanex across Europe. Its Oral Care business has also been performing well, particularly in Africa. Some other notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, as well as the Hello Products LLC buyout.The company recently partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. This product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices. Further, the new brand will be available in limited countries in the said region.Backed by premium innovation, products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste have been performing well. The company is on track to launch Optic White Renewal and Optify Pro Series in the United States to drive long-term growth. Also, CL’s at-home whitening and professional whitening products bode well.Another trait that puts Colgate on the growth track is its efforts to expand the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. This is one of Colgate’s priorities and has been the key reason to improve organic sales in recent years. The company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands.In 2019, the company expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Colgate has been witnessing positive customer feedback for its elmex and meridol brands, driven by increased investment. Moreover, it is impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists.The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Further, it is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough cost and inflation headwinds are likely to persist in the near term, the company’s product innovation, pricing efforts and expansion plans are expected to bring renewed momentum in the stock.

Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude build of 0.25M barrels instead for last week to add to the 3.955M gain in the prior week to Sept. 8.On the fuels side, the EIA reported a gasoline inventory decline of 0.831M barrels. The forecast consensus had been for a gasoline build of 1.1M barrels that would have added to the prior week’s build of 5.561M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a drop of 2.867M barrels versus the expected gain of 1.05M and the prior week’s rise of 3.931M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.“We had runaway exports of crude versus lower imports last week, that’s basically what it came down to,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital and a regular commentator on the trends and statistics in oil. “Also, refiners seem to have started dialing back a little on runs with the end of the peak summer driving season.”Exports of U.S. crude climbed to a whopping 5.067M barrels per day last week versus the prior week’s 3.09M. Imports averaged 6.5M daily last week, down 1.1M from the previous week. Refineries ran at 91.9% of their operable capacity last week, against a previous rate of more than 93%.The estimated production of crude oil for last week remained at a 3-year high of 12.9 million barrels, despite the EIA of late indicating declines in monthly output by U.S. oil drillers in its separately-published drilling productivity report.Story continuesRelated ArticlesU.S. crude oil, fuel stocks down as exports surge, imports drop - EIARepublican hopeful DeSantis slams EVs, climate ""fear"" in energy speechDozens of nations to sign U.N. ocean treaty but implementation still awaits]"

The Brent crude slipped around one percent, settling near $93 per barrel. This shift in the market suggested that the recent surge might have been excessive.The decline was also observed in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery, which decreased by 1.1 percent, declining to $89.45 per barrel at 6:19 a.m. The October contract, due to expire on Wednesday, dropped by 1.4 percent to $89.92 per barrel. Brent for November settlement slid by 1.1 percent to $93.30 per barrel after nearing $96 during intraday trading on Tuesday.The preceding rise in crude prices was primarily due to supply restrictions imposed by OPEC+ powerhouses, Saudi Arabia and Russia, together with optimistic economic forecasts from the world's largest economies, the United States and China. This price increase sparked discussions about oil potentially returning to $100 per barrel, a situation that could present challenges for central bank authorities, including the Federal Reserve, who were set to determine policy later on Wednesday.Market indicators suggest a tightening in supply and demand. The American Petroleum Institute reported that nationwide inventories fell by 5.25 million barrels last week, which included a drawdown at the Cushing hub according to sources familiar with the data. AlphaBBL Corp.'s separate evaluation also indicated a reduction at the Oklahoma storage site. Official data is expected to be released later on Wednesday.Moreover, timespreads continue to display a robust tone.

Despite being significantly lower than the peak of over $5 a gallon in June 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this price is still notably higher than historical averages. The price increase has been steady, marking an approximately 20 percent rise since the beginning of the year and over 8 percent since June 1.The surge in gas prices is primarily attributed to the rise in oil prices in commodity markets. The American crude benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, has seen a nearly 30 percent rise since June 1. This increase is due to several factors including geopolitical events, weather conditions, and financial market sentiment.A significant contributor to this price surge is Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to reduce oil production until the end of 2023. Despite an economic downturn, China continues to import oil at high rates to manage geopolitical risks and support its manufacturing and transportation sectors. The Northern Hemisphere's unusually hot summer also played a role by reducing refinery production capacity.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, used by President Biden to help lower oil and gas prices, is currently at a historically low level. The government has postponed refilling the reserve due to high prices and is likely to wait until prices decrease.However, indications suggest that gas prices may start to decline soon. In most states, a shift to a cheaper blend of gasoline containing more butane typically occurs in the fall. Additionally, gas prices usually drop during this season as demand decreases after the peak driving season.Analysts also anticipate a slowdown in global economic growth in 2024 which could result in reduced demand for oil and consequently lower gas prices. Furthermore, some analysts speculate that Saudi Arabia and Russia may not extend their production cuts into the new year, potentially alleviating another source of pressure on prices.Story continuesThe production cuts have proven profitable for major oil producers, collectively known as OPEC Plus. Therefore, there may not be a need for these producers to prolong the cuts, which could otherwise lead to excessive energy price inflation and reduced consumption.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Discovery up to half a billion dollars.Story continuesRather than bolster confidence in the finances of the company, however, the announcement further put pressure on Disney shares, sending the stock down 4% at one point on Tuesday. Earlier this month they even plumbed nearly 10-year lows.700 million Disney fans worldwideOn Tuesday, Disney said it would pour $60 billion into its Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP) over the next ten years.This division contributed triple the profits of its content operations, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and generates around $30 billion in annualized revenue.With the exception of the two pandemic years, it has consistently delivered an operating margin in the high 20s.Disney owns six global parks that operate around the clock every day of the year and welcomes 100 million guests every year.They're led by Walt Disney World, a 25,000-acre site so enormous it can easily swallow the island of Manhattan whole.Disney also operates a fleet of five cruise liners that act as miniature floating theme parks flexibly deployed to soak up demand that cannot be serviced by its fix-point resorts.Management estimates it has an addressable market of over 700 million Disney fans worldwide, more than 90% of whom cannot or do not visit the parks.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $23 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Devon Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.43 per share to $1.45 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Devon Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Its bottom-line is projected to rise 7.8% year-over-year for 2024, while Wall Street anticipates its top line to improve by 11.5%.Six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $5.52 per share. ORCL boasts an average earnings surprise of 3.8%.Looking at cash flow, Oracle is expected to report cash flow growth of 18.6% this year; ORCL has generated cash flow growth of 3.2% over the past three to five years.ORCL should be on investors' short lists because of its impressive growth fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and strong Growth and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Speaking at Oracle CloudWorld 2023 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Ellison endorsed a radical vision of what generative AI could achieve in the near future.Ellison, whose company has long been involved in data analytics and artificial intelligence, emphasized the potential of generative AI, a technology capable of creating new content. He highlighted its transformative power, stating that it is likely the most important new computer technology ever. The Oracle executive predicted that we will soon find out the true impact of generative AI as countless billions of dollars are being invested in this technology.In his keynote speech, Ellison pointed out that generative AI has already started to revolutionize various sectors. Large language models such as ChatGPT and Cohere have developed capabilities to generate not only language but also images, music, poetry, and even computer code. He also mentioned the imminent arrival of self-driving cars from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) powered by generative AI.Addressing the impact of this development on Oracle, Ellison revealed that the company is quite satisfied with its progress so far. He explained that Oracle's unique network interconnection to the cloud sets them apart from other cloud vendors. This remote data memory access network allows one computer in the network to access another's memory without interrupting its function, enabling faster data transfer than conventional models.Oracle has been integrating artificial intelligence into its Oracle Fusion suite of cloud-based applications. The company claims that these new capabilities can detect and connect relevant account records in Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, providing sellers with actionable insights. In addition, AI has been added to Oracle Fusion Cloud Customer Experience (CX) to assist marketers, sellers, and service agents in enhancing customer experience.Story continuesRob Tarkoff, general manager of Oracle Cloud CX, emphasized the transformative role of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in changing how we interact with people, content, and critical knowledge in enterprises. He highlighted the efficiency and accuracy brought about by the unique combination of traditional and generative AI running on Oracle Cloud infrastructure.The company also announced the integration of generative AI services for healthcare organizations. Integrated with Oracle's electronic health record (EHR) systems, an Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant is said to assist healthcare providers in reducing manual work so they can focus more on patient care.Ellison concluded his speech by announcing that new applications at Oracle will be generated by AI rather than being written in Java. The company is using Oracle APEX, its enterprise low-code and no-code application platform, to generate most new Oracle applications. He promised that this new development methodology would be faster, more secure, and more reliable than traditional methods.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -3.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.52 points to a change of +7.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.10 indicates a change of +10.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.48 billion and $57.49 billion estimates indicate +11.5% and +7.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $12.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +4.39%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.94% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.53%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 11.51% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 3.69%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.85%.Micron will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be September 27, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Micron to post earnings of -$1.19 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 182.07%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.91 billion, down 41.08% from the prior-year quarter.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Micron. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) held its Innovation Conference and it presented all the right products, until CFO David Zinser warned of excess data center chip inventories during a meeting with analysts.Micron’s Recovery On The Back Of Microsoft And NvidiaThe 1-beta DRAM chips that Micron makes are designed for data centers, which are boosting demand for the hardware needed to power large language models and generative AI, like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed Open AI’s ChatGPT. With a surge in demand in AI server-build-outs, Ho believes that Micron is well positioned to become a second source Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the second half of 2024.Micron CFO Also Expressed Optimism In AugustMicron’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy showed his optimism regarding pricing trends at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference, as he observed a bottoming out of prices. Murphy predicted strengthening through the second half of the year, under the assumption that the supply discipline is maintained and volume continues to expand.Intel Might Be Late To The AI Race, But Shouldn’t Be Ruled Out Just YetZinser’s remarks about a slower-than-expected recovery in the demand for data center chips caused Intel shares to drop by 4.5%. Zinser revealed that the inventory of data center processors is taking longer to clear and projected an ""inventory digestion"" phase for Intel during the third and likely fourth quarter of the year, before expecting any positive turnaround in the data center business. But earlier on Tuesday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger provided very powerful news of launching processors designed to power laptops capable of artificial intelligence that are expected to strengthen the company’s product portfolio. This kind of innovation could potentially offset some of the challenges that Intel's data center business is facing. Last month, Gelsinger reaffirmed that Intel is on track to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in leading-edge technology with its “five nodes in four years” strategy. Intel also reiterated that it is developing its AI supercomputer based on its Gaudi AI accelerators and Xeon processors. Therefore, as far as AI goes, Intel is getting there, but this journey will take time.Story continuesAll That Optimism Is Yet To Be JustifiedAll in all, both Micron and Intel affirm that their technological catch-ups and turnarounds remain on track, but they are taking significant capital with only hopes that the PC market has hit bottom and data centers still need to turn to growth for all that optimism to gain solid ground.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

278,b9e08dff-c5aa-3838-bd6e-18fed855e11b,MU,2023-09-21,Is It Worth Investing in Micron (MU) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-micron-mu-based-133006410.html,1695216606,STORY,['MU'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Micron (MU).Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.51, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.51 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.1% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Micron, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$4.56.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At present, the CME FedWatch is showing that market participants are almost certain that the central bank will keep the Fed fund rate at the existing range of 5.25-5.5% with an assigned probability of 98%. The CME FedWatch is also showing that there exists just 28% chance that interest rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points in the November FOMC meeting.Despite these positives, investors remained concerned about the Fed’s future course of actions in the past one and a half months. Volatility returned to Wall Street in early August after an impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. In this regard, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized word-by-word to find out the future course of the Fed’s monetary policies.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks (components of the Dow 30) with a favorable Zacks Rank.

The stock is now up 8.1% in September, though its recent pop has it trading near a trendline with historically bearish implications.Specifically, TRIP recently came within one standard deviation of its 120-day moving average, after a lengthy stretch below the trendline. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there were five similar pullbacks over the past couple years. The equity averaged a one-month loss of 7.5% after four of those signals. From where the stock currently sits, a similar move would put Tripadvisor back around $15.15.TRIP Chart September 202023Options traders emphasized calls over the last two weeks, and an unwinding of this optimism is likely to pressure the equity. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), TRIP's 10-day call/put volume ratio of 3.16 ranks in the 77th percentile of annual readings, which indicates a preference for bullish bets compared to the last 12 months.Options look like the ideal avenue to pursue for those looking to speculate on TripAdvisor stock, as it sports relatively cheap premium. This is per the equity's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 34%, which stands higher than just 3% of readings from the past year.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Airline Stocks to Buy Now.Air travel industry is in recovery mode with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening of the global economy. Unlike in the past three years, there has been a shift with most travelers opting for international travel, something that is helping airlines draw in big revenues from air travel fees and ticket sales.The pandemic brought many challenges as the travel industry came to a standstill. Many airlines plunged into debt and lost a combined $200 billion between 2020 and 2022. It’s only now that most are slowly returning to profitability as they salivate to serve travel-deprived consumers with the easing of travel restrictions worldwide.Major airlines led by United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines continue to rake in huge profits owing to passengers’ willingness to pay higher fares supported by increasing travel demand. The airlines have also benefited from a shortage of airplanes and pilots, allowing them to charge a premium on travel fees without much resentment. Nevertheless, the increase in consumer spending on travel and entertainment remains one of the biggest catalysts for the airline industry.The average cost of flying in the US has increased significantly to historic highs in the industry, bouncing back from the pandemic turmoil. The consumer price index for airline tickets is already up by more than 20% for the year, representing the largest jump since the Federal Reserve started racking the index.Executives from the major airlines expect air travel fares to continue increasing in response to the high demand amid a shortage of planes. Similarly, the executive expects demand for air travel to surge despite the ever-growing risk of recession.Despite the high cost of traveling amid the high inflation and interest rate environment, people continue to make travel arrangements. A Bank of America study showed that spending at airlines and travel agencies is already by more than 60% for the year as more people continue to make travel arrangements.Story continuesNearly two out of every adults plan to take a vacation before year-end, with most shrugging off the rising prices and interest rates.“This year, as prices and interest rates continue to push higher, we’re seeing more signals that vacationers are adapting their plans. Many are still going somewhere, but they’re being more thoughtful about how they’re spending,” said Ted Rossman Bankrate, senior industry analyst The surge in air travel fares has to do with many carriers needing to improve in rebuilding their pre-pandemic flight schedules. A global shortage of aircraft has seen a reduction in aircraft in the tarmacs needed to address the influx of air travel demand. A restricted supply of seats amid high demand is expected to support prices that should allow airlines to continue generating more revenues.On the other hand, the biggest risk to the airline industry is the rising cost of jet fuel. Energy prices have increased significantly in recent months, with crude oil rallying to ten-month highs of $90 a barrel. The increasing energy costs are likely to trigger higher inflation, something that could affect consumer purchasing power, prompting most of them to shelve their travel plans.Nevertheless, the increase in international travel costs due to higher jet fuel could take a toll on the sector that is still in recovery mode from the COVID-19 triggered slowdown. According to Peter McNally of Third Bridge Global Sector lead for Industrials Materials and Energy, airplane capacity issues could become rampant as travel costs soar due to higher jet fuel costs.Some airlines have already started cutting guidance due to the higher fuel costs. For instance, American Airlines expects its Q3 earnings to range between $0.20 and $0.30 a share below the previous guidance of between $0.85 and $0.95. Amid the cuts, most airlines are expected to pass the elevated costs due to high fuel costs, labor issues, and strong dollar to customers owing to the high demand in the market.Waning travel demand is another issue that could batter the sector heading into year-end. Southwest Airlines has already embarked on aggressive marketing campaigns as it looks to get more people booking for its flights.The airline offers triple Companion Pass qualifying points per flight for people looking through its business channels. The easier way to earn the points signifies the ever-growing need to fill seats not just this year but into 2024.11 Best Airline Stocks to Invest In Right NowSource:pixabayDespite the concerns, the air travel industry remains on course to finish the year on a high as airlines continue charging premium fares. As the air travel industry continues to rebound from the pandemic slowdown and airlines report record revenues and profits, tremendous investment opportunities continue cropping up, with most airline stocks trading at highly discounted levels.The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which offers exposure to passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators, is flat for the year, signaling how investors have shunned the sector despite the solid fundamentals.Morningstar expects the operating environment in the US airline sector to continue improving and return to more normalized competitive dynamics once supply constraints moderate. Declining fuel costs in a consolidated industry and robust demand for air travel should offer the much-needed support.Our MethodologyWhile relentless travel demand has sent bookings in major US carriers soaring and leading to bumper earnings, the same is yet to reflect in stock valuations. Most stocks appear to be trading at great discounts, therefore offering a high-risk reward opportunity. We have combined the best airline stocks to invest in, as listed in the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), based on their underlying fundamentals.

Considering its current trading price is $157.685, the model indicates a margin of safety of approximately 43.15%. This suggests that UPS is significantly undervalued. Additionally, with a business predictability rank of 4 out of 5, UPS demonstrates a high level of predictability in its operations.A Deep Dive into UPS's DCF AnalysisUPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSThis article provides a comprehensive DCF analysis of United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), a data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model. This is based on research that shows that historically, stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.As of September 20, 2023, UPS's intrinsic value, calculated by the Discounted Earnings model, is $277.35. Given its current trading price of $157.685, the margin of safety based on the DCF model stands at 43.15%. This indicates that the company is significantly undervalued.United Parcel Service Inc: A Deep Dive into Its Intrinsic Value(Do Not Publish)The Two-Stage DCF ModelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the Growth Stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the Terminal Stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. UPS's intrinsic value, estimated by the Discounted Earnings model, is arrived at by following certain assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$11.53The GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically, stock prices are more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.35%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10%Years of Growth Stage = 10The growth rate is chosen based on availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4%Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the EPS will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=148.85Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=128.5Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=277.35Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $223.75. This valuation indicates that UPS is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 29.53%. Users can switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocusUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

At its most basic (or theoretical), dynamic — or surge — pricing matches prices with real-time supply and demand to endeavor to provide the most transparent discovery of current market conditions.The less-than-truckload industry has adopted the model. The parcel-delivery industry, normally more of a first mover in pricing trends, has been slow to follow. One reason is that it is difficult to embed transactional pricing in a world dominated by contractual relationships.Josh Taylor, senior director of professional services at consultancy Shipware LLC, spoke about dynamic pricing at the recent Parcel Forum in Nashville, Tennessee. In the following interview, he dives deeper into an issue that is bound to increase in relevance.FREIGHTWAVES: Can you explain how the dynamic pricing model works in the parcel industry?TAYLOR: A dynamic pricing model enables a carrier to charge less when it has excess network capacity and more as that capacity is filled. The FedEx Great Rates program for international shipments has followed this pricing model for years. It is the purest example of dynamic pricing I’ve seen from UPS or FedEx. Other parcel carriers have discussed implementing this model on a larger scale, which is already common among LTL providers.Recently, UPS (NYSE: UPS) discussed a day-of-week parcel pricing model that charges more on the days when it is traditionally busiest. It’s not truly dynamic if the days and charges are locked in ahead of time, but it is a step toward a more dynamic pricing model. Peak/“demand” surcharges are another example of UPS, FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and [regional carrier] OnTrac moving toward dynamic pricing — the more packages a shipper sends above a preestablished weekly baseline, the higher surcharge they pay per piece.FREIGHTWAVES: How significant a development is this?Story continuesTAYLOR: The large-scale application of dynamic pricing will be an enormous shift in the parcel market. It will change how shippers make decisions. Carrier networks will become more efficient as they smooth asset utilization and target desirable package characteristics. If done in an equitable way, many shippers will save money as their products arrive at least as quickly and reliably as they do today.FREIGHTWAVES: Who wins and loses under this model? And can a win-win for shippers and carriers be achieved?TAYLOR: For dynamic pricing to benefit the shipper and end consumer, shippers need the flexibility to choose between carriers as network capacities rise and fall. This ensures competition between carriers and prevents a single carrier from simply charging more during their busier times without charging less during their slower times. On the downside, even if pricing is desirable, managing too many carriers can be time consuming and take up valuable dock space.Without the freedom to choose between carriers — specifically, if a shipper has a FedEx or UPS contract with an early termination or minimum commitment clause tied to punitive fees — shippers will be exposed to their carrier’s desire to boost margins. Even if it doesn’t happen immediately, UPS or FedEx will inevitably decide to double-dip on profit improvements through improved network efficiency and by charging higher rates. However, if UPS and FedEx allow shippers to choose the best carrier for each shipment based on their immediate value, the legacy carriers will become more commoditized and less able to demand premium prices.FREIGHTWAVES: Will dynamic pricing language need to be included in contracts? And can dynamic pricing be negotiated out of a contract?TAYLOR: The day-of-week pricing offers I’m aware of were purely contractual, and none of them were signed after the shipper read the fine print. However, it won’t be long until other dynamic pricing models are offered which may be based on the same base rates used in static pricing contracts today. The smallest shippers will have a harder time avoiding dynamic pricing if UPS, for example, was to apply it through DAP, their Digital Access Program. Larger shippers, however, will have the opportunity to remain on traditional pricing models or move to something more dynamic.When given this choice, shippers must ensure they understand every table, chart and sentence of the proposal before making their decision. At least for the foreseeable future, everything remains negotiable.FREIGHTWAVES: Do you see this becoming a standard practice among all carriers, regionals as well as the national carriers?TAYLOR: Smaller carriers may have an easier time implementing true dynamic pricing. Most smaller carriers already compete on the merits of their products — the right service, the right quality, for the right price — making it almost a foregone conclusion that their shippers will have the freedom to choose the best-fit carrier for each shipment. Even without charging more, balancing asset utilization across their networks will improve service, reduce cost and expand margins.At the Parcel Forum, one of the attendees offered an opinion that I agree with: Most shippers that agree to a dynamic pricing model will start small. They will keep most of their shipping on a traditional pricing program with UPS and/or FedEx. Carriers will need to prove the mutual benefit of dynamic pricing models before they become widely accepted. Parcel shipping is simply too large of an expense to get wrong.FREIGHTWAVES: How does dynamic pricing work if a shipper is exclusive to one carrier?TAYLOR: Agreeing to a dynamic pricing model with a single carrier is a huge risk. Without the freedom for shippers to choose other carriers when prices are high, there is little incentive for the carrier to offer lower rates on their slower days. The shipper is forced to either pay the higher rates on the busier days or incur the costs to defer shipping until the cheaper days. Shippers that opt for tech enhancements to defer shipping may incur software and implementation costs and will certainly struggle with irregular staffing requirements. Shippers that choose to stage packages on-site until the cheaper day will likely experience increased operations costs and suffer a higher rate of lost or damaged shipments.Regardless of how a shipper holds the package, the time between the customer placing the order and receiving the shipment will be extended by a day or more — a catastrophic development for marketplace sellers.FREIGHTWAVES: Do you foresee shipper resistance to this approach?TAYLOR: The single-carrier, day-of-week offers I’m aware of have all been rejected by the targeted shippers. To drive acceptance, no carrier should penalize a shipper for choosing freely between multiple carriers. Also, forecasting transportation costs and sticking to a budget are extremely valuable to many businesses, so limiting price changes to within a given range may help address those concerns. Carriers’ margins will already improve through better asset utilization, so charging a higher average cost per shipment is double-dipping at the expense of shippers and end consumers. Without reasonable carrier concessions protecting shippers and incentivizing them to participate, usage will remain limited.FREIGHTWAVES: Is one of the national carriers pushing this harder than the other?TAYLOR: UPS has discussed dynamic pricing in more detail than FedEx on their quarterly investor calls. They have also provided the only day-of-week offers I know of. However, regional carriers like Better Trucks and others have been very open about the potential mutual benefits of dynamic pricing done right. As UPS’ and FedEx’s pricing practices push sellers to fulfill closer to the end consumer, those same shippers gain greater access to regional carriers hungry to differentiate themselves from the legacy carriers. The right version of dynamic pricing could easily provide that differentiation.FREIGHTWAVES: Is this more of an attempt to offset higher costs or to drive profitable revenue?From UPS and FedEx salespeople, shippers can expect to hear about how dynamic pricing will offset higher network costs and maybe even tamp down future rate increases. This is how the salespeople will have been trained to sell it and most of them will genuinely believe it, even if it is only part of the truth.The rest of the truth will come during investment calls as carrier executives highlight growing profitable revenue and increasing margins, even as they couch these statements in win-win-win marketing spin. If done right, however, dynamic pricing will help carriers control network costs, improve reliability and reduce lost and damaged packages while passing on some of the savings to shippers. This combination of superior service and reasonable rates will enable them to maintain favorable margins while winning more desirable parcel volume from shippers that share in the benefits of truly dynamic competition.The post How will dynamic pricing shape parcel’s future? appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

This forecast comes in light of the recent labor negotiations at United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), which concluded in late August, leading some businesses to redirect their volume to FedEx.The potential labor stoppage at UPS had businesses on edge and the company's announcement last week that it anticipates its third-quarter EPS to be 25% lower than the consensus further fueled the shift. Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee attributed this downward revision to increased labor costs and the consequent volume shifts.Raymond James analyst Patrick Tyler Brown noted that FedEx has benefited from this redirected volume. He also pointed out that FedEx's stock performance received a slight boost from the bankruptcy of Yellow (OTC:YELLQ), a less-than-truckload service provider similar to FedEx, as well as FedEx's own cost-reduction initiatives.Over the past few months, FedEx's shares have seen an approximate 8% rise. In June, despite reporting better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company provided weaker-than-anticipated guidance. Management projected earnings between $16.50 and $18.50 per share for fiscal year 2024, an increase from nearly $15 per share earned in fiscal year 2023. Although this represents growth compared to 2023, Wall Street was expecting around $18.30 per share at that time.In response to these projections, FedEx shares dipped by 2.5%, closing at $224.73. However, they have since rebounded and closed on Tuesday at just under $250 a share. So far this year, FedEx shares have surged by 44%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which have risen about 16% and 4% respectively.The volume shift from UPS may influence FedEx's performance over the next one or two quarters. Investors will be closely watching for positive volume and pricing trends in addition to a strong fiscal first quarter to maintain the upward trajectory of the stock.Story continuesFedEx's management is set to discuss the results in a conference call at 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT) today.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The pandemic disrupted the financial landscape, putting billions of dollars in credit card loan repayments at risk. Moreover, the very essence of American Express, its travel and entertainment perks, became obsolete as those industries ground to a halt.Faced with these challenges, the world's largest card issuer took decisive action. Amex tightened its belt, curbing short-term expenditures and imposing an external hiring freeze, all while managing to avoid layoffs. Yet even in this strategic retreat, there were potential costs, especially for shareholders, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding a substantial 20% stake in the company.Instead of succumbing to panic over the implications of Buffett's substantial investment, Squeri chose a different path. The chairman of Amex, a stalwart of the company for nearly four decades, picked up the phone.His call to Buffett wasn't merely a plea about the company's share price; it was a pitch for growth. Squeri proposed a bold strategy, including a $1 billion investment to introduce a suite of new customer services and the strategic acquisition of businesses at discounted rates which could prove useful in the future.“I called Warren Buffett and said, ‘We’re probably going to lose $4 a share, and I am not sure when billing is going to come back… But I think what we need to do is take care of our colleagues [and] take care of our customers. If we do that, I think, we’ll have long-term viability for our shareholders,’” Squeri told the Financial Times.It was a pitch based on Squeri's philosophy that to get ahead of a downturn, businesses must be prepared for the ""upswing"" the other side.Fortunately for the former Accenture consultant, Buffett is famously a fan of long-term strategies. Story continuesSqueri told the Financial Times Buffett approved of the plans, and also gave him a sage piece of advice: ""The most important thing to take care of is your customers and your brand. It’s hard to get customers back. And once you damage the brand, it’s damaged.""With Buffett's backing, Squeri charged ahead with his plan, rolling out a raft of financial hardship programs as well as extending the length of time new customers had to earn their welcome bonus.Squeri's daily routineIf a man worth $124 billion (according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index) gives you a piece of business advice, you take it.Squeri's schedule suggests he's already on the same page as Buffett when it comes to putting consumers first, revealing he spends three hours a day answering every customer email that comes into his inbox.""I get 150 to 200 customer emails a day. I read and answer every single one,"" the Amex stalwart told the Financial Times. ""We say we’re a membership model. How do you ignore them?""With more than 77,000 employees—and the No. 3 spot on Fortune's Great Place to Work 2023 100 Best Companies to Work For—as well as a reported 122 million customers, it's perhaps no surprise that Squeri says his job is ""24/7.""Squeri's day begins at 5:45 a.m.; he leaves for the office at 6 a.m. and works in the car. By 6.45 a.m. he's at the office in New York, where he works out for half an hour before having a breakfast of tea and fruit.At 8 a.m. work starts and a day of meetings follows; Squeri's work life is ""intense,"" he says.Lunch is at noon, eating a Chopt salad at his desk.From 12:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. it's ""back-to-back,"" Squeri said, adding: ""I’ll try and go to the cafeteria sometimes to pick up a snack, so people can see me and to break the monotony.""At 5:30 p.m. he leaves the office and makes his way home, though he still answers work calls, and has dinner.At 7:30 p.m. he logs on again, this time to spend three hours going through customer emails. Then Squeri unwinds for an hour, and goes to bed at 11: 30 p.m.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

TSCO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSCOUnveiling the Investment Potential of Tractor Supply Co (TSCO): A Comprehensive Analysis of Financial Metrics and Competitive StrengthsDecoding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Tractor Supply Co has been assigned the following ranks:Financial strength rank: 6/10Profitability rank: 10/10Growth rank: 10/10GF Value rank: 6/10Momentum rank: 8/10Each one of these components is ranked and the ranks also have positive correlation with the long term performances of stocks. The GF score is calculated using the five key aspects of analysis. Through backtesting, we know that each of these key aspects has a different impact on the stock price performance. Thus, they are weighted differently when calculating the total score.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mondelez International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$5.6b ÷ (US$72b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 10%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Food industry. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Mondelez International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Mondelez International has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 28% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, we're delighted to see that Mondelez International has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with a respectable 85% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Mondelez International can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Mondelez International   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The Boston Scientific Foundation is a non-profit that works to help other non-profits.Founded in 2001, the Boston Scientific Foundation is funded by an endowment that was established by private donors. Each year, it bestows grants to non-profit organizations within 60 miles of its largest U.S. facilities in four states.""One of the key advantages is that we're able to help smaller non-profits that the larger company cannot and therefore maximize the benefit we're able to have in very specific communities,"" says Dave Knapp, president of the Boston Scientific Foundation.2. Non-profits that support the Boston Scientific Foundation mission may apply for funding.Each year, organizations may submit proposals to the Boston Scientific Foundation to be considered for financial grants.In particular, the Foundation awards grants to organizations that serve the economically disadvantaged in one of two areas: science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and programs that improve health.Recent grantees include Community Servings - which delivers nutritious meals to the chronically ill in the Boston area - and CreateMPLS, which teaches crucial technology skills to students in Minnesota.Story continuesThe Boston Scientific Foundation also offers an academic scholarship program for children of full-time company employees in the U.S.3. Boston Scientific employees help to determine which organizations receive grants.With many deserving non-profits submitting proposals to the Boston Scientific Foundation, it's up to local community teams made up of over 75 employee volunteers to review them and recommend to the Boston Scientific Foundation Board of Directors how it should best distribute its funds.""Our employee community teams are basically the engine for the Boston Scientific Foundation,"" says Knapp. ""They're helping to make things happen for non-profits in their communities and I'm so inspired that they take their personal time to do this work.""4. There is also a non-profit organization that specifically serves communities in Europe.The Boston Scientific Foundation Europe was established five years ago to help non-profits based on that continent and is funded each year by local legal entities of the company in Europe.The first grantee was Mécénat Chirurgie Cardiaque for their 5/5 program - a remote learning platform for doctors practicing in underserved African countries to improve the diagnoses of heart conditions in children. The Boston Scientific Foundation Europe has continued to prioritize innovative digital health solutions ever since.""There's so much that needs to be done in health care,"" notes Simonetta Balbi, president of the Boston Scientific Foundation Europe. ""We decided to create this focus so that we could address gaps in healthcare in a specific way and increase our ability to make an impact.""Similar to the Boston Scientific Foundation, the Boston Scientific Foundation Europe relies on employee ambassadors representing countries across Europe who bring grant proposals to a board that includes six Boston Scientific employees and three senior representatives of patient organizations for their final review.5. The work of the Boston Scientific Foundation and the Boston Scientific Foundation Europe affects the granters and the grantees alike.In 2022, the Boston Scientific Foundation gave 34 STEM grants and 21 health grants as well as 118 college scholarships. It also made a one-time grant to Project HOPE to help refugees during the Ukraine crisis.Additionally, in its first five years, the Boston Scientific Foundation Europe has funded 20 digital health initiatives and reached communities in more than 50 countries in Europe and EMEA, including humanitarian relief efforts for the people of Ukraine, Turkey and Syria.Balbi and Knapp both say that the work they do to help people in need brings great personal reward.""One project I loved this year is that we funded a mobile STEM bus in Indiana,"" says Knapp. ""In rural communities, people have to drive many miles to find resources for students to learn coding and other key skills. This bus can go from location to location to develop STEM talent at a high level.""For Balbi, it's the pediatric projects that are most moving.""We are supporting a French hospital, the Centre Pediatrique de Cote, that takes care of seriously disabled children, many of whom cannot speak,"" she says. ""Our grant is funding special tablets so they can communicate. When we visited the hospital, we met a little girl that was using the technology to communicate with her eyes. She's a great candidate for this tablet and we'll be able to help her receive it.""Learn about the work that Boston Scientific does to support its communities through donations and volunteer programs.Visit the Boston Scientific Foundation and the Boston Scientific Foundation Europe to learn more about the work they do and their impact around the world.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/boston-scientificEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/786230/what-is-the-boston-scientific-foundation]"

Bank stocks have underperformed by a wide margin this year. So far in 2023, the S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index (INDEXSP:SPSIBK) has declined 15% compared to a 17% gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. The poor performance has been caused by a full-blown banking crisis this spring that saw several regional lenders in the U.S. collapse, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There is also concern about a credit crunch prompted by interest rates that have been raised by the U.S. Federal Reserve to their highest level in 22 years in order to combat inflation, and rising levels of consumer debt. It’s all conspired to shake confidence in stocks of financial services firms and send their share prices sharply lower.This should be seen as a buying opportunity among investors, especially as stocks of some of the most stable and well-capitalized lenders in the world are now available to buy at extreme discounts to their intrinsic value. While many tech stocks look grossly overvalued after tripling since the start of this year, bank stocks look woefully undervalued by comparison. Here are the seven most undervalued financial services stocks to buy in September 2023.Charles Schwab (SCHW)Charles Schwab headquarters in SOMA district; The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is a bank and stock brokerage firmSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comCharles Schwab’s (NYSE:SCHW) stock is down 25% on the year and currently trading at just 17 times forward earnings. The banking crisis this past spring and concerns about the company’s bond losses have pulled share price lower. It stood at $28 billion earlier this year, about the same level as Silicon Valley Bank before its collapse. Those concerns look to be abating now, though, and SCHW stock appears to have bottomed in mid-May of this year. Since then, the company’s share price has gained nearly 30%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOther reasons to consider Charles Schwab when looking at financial services stocks to buy now is that it is one of the 10 largest financial services companies in the U.S. The company offers a diverse range of products that include retail banking, commercial banking, investing services, and wealth management advisory. It currently has nearly 35 million brokerage accounts and more than $7 trillion of assets under management. While SCHW stock has been knocked lower this year, the share price is up 20% over five years and it has tripled in the past decade.Story continuesBank of America (BAC)Stock market or forex trading graph and candlestick chart suitable for financial investment concept. Economy trends background for business idea and all art work design. Abstract finance background.Source: ShutterstockBank of America (NYSE:BAC), the second largest financial services company in the U.S., looks extremely undervalued right now. BAC stock is down 18% over the last 12 months, bringing its five-year return to a negative 4%. The lender’s shares are currently trading at nine times future earnings, and the shares offer a quarterly dividend of 24 cents for a best-in-class yield of 3.30%. At this valuation, Bank of America looks like a no brainer for buy-and-hold investors.One wouldn’t know it looking at the stock’s performance, but Bank of America continues to outperform on the earnings front. In July, the company reported second quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines due to higher interest rate income. Also this summer, Bank of America settled a legal issue with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, agreeing to pay a fine for charging unnecessary fees to clients. The settlement lifts a cloud from BAC stock, paving the way for it to reverse higher.Morgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) isn’t your average investment bank. Outgoing CEO James Gorman has shifted the company’s focus to wealth management, which has helped the financial firm achieve consistent earnings amid the current drought in Wall Street deals such as mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and initial public offerings (IPOs). This diversification has set Morgan Stanley apart and enabled it to produce strong Q2 financial results, beating analysts’ expectations across the board.For Q2 of this year, Morgan Stanley announced EPS of $1.24, which beat consensus expectations of $1.15. Revenue in the April through June period totaled $13.46 billion versus $13.08 billion that had been forecast. Sadly, the diversification and strong financials haven’t helped MS stock. The share price hasn’t moved at all this year and is down 4% over the last 12 months. Morgan Stanley too pays a strong quarterly dividend that yields nearly 4%, and its stock is changing hands at 15 times forward earnings.Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comMastercard (NYSE:MA), which specializes in consumer credit cards and is the second-largest payment-processing company in the world, is another financial services concern that has reported strong earnings this year. The strong results led MA stock to hit a record intraday high on July 27 of this year, the day its Q2 print was made public. However, the company’s share price is only about 5% higher than where it was when the market peaked in autumn 2021, having swooned during last year’s downturn.Mastercard recently announced a plan to recycle billions of plastic credit and debit cards, diverting them from landfills around the world. Under the plan, Mastercard is providing shredding machines to issuers of its credit and debit cards, each of which will be able to hold 10,000 cards. The move to reduce its plastic waste has garnered the financial services company some positive media coverage. MA stock pays a quarterly dividend of 57 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 0.55%.Goldman Sachs (GS)Three people sit around a table holding financial charts and a tablet device.Source: ShutterstockNext on the list of financial services stocks to buy now is investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which just announced several changes to its executive leadership team. It also announced plans to sell part of its wealth management business as it moves to focus on serving ultra-rich clients. These moves are the latest efforts by the financial services company to right its own ship following a period of chronic underperformance. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is under pressure to improve the bank’s results after reporting the firm’s lowest quarterly profits in three years this summer, and amid negative press coverage.A two-year slump in investment banking activity related to IPOs and M&amp;A activity hurt Goldman’s profits. The company has announced 3,200 job cuts this year and plans to cut expenses by $1 billion over the coming two years. In a series of recent interviews, Solomon said that the firm is returning its focus to its core businesses of investment banking. The shifting tides come as GS stock has fallen 4% this year. The shares now trade at 14 times future earnings and pay a strong quarterly dividend that yields 3.29%.Capital One (COF)capital one (COF) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Isabelle OHara/Shutterstock.comShares of Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) could use a boost. The company specializing in credit cards, auto loans, banking, and savings accounts for retail clients has seen its share price decline 8% in the last 12 months. Through five years, COF stock is up a marginal 3%. Right now, Capital One’s shares are trading at only seven times future earnings and they pay a dividend of 60 cents per quarter, giving it a decent yield of 2.37%.A weak credit market and rising delinquency rates on credit cards and other loans have attributed to the decline of COF stock. However, at least one prominent investor doesn’t seem to be worried and sees the current valuation on Capital One as a buying opportunity. In May of this year, Warren Buffett bought nearly $1 billion of COF stock. Buffett now owns 12.47 million shares of Capital One. Buffett’s position was a vote of confidence in Capital One, especially since he has sold nearly all of his other bank holdings.UBS Group (UBS)UBS (UBS) bank sign on gray stone wall with red and gray logoSource: shutterstock.com/Judith LinineAdmittedly, UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) is a bit of an outlier here as the Swiss banking giant’s share price has gained 36% since January of this year. However, the stock still looks undervalued right now compared to where the financial services company is likely headed following its takeover of former rival Credit Suisse. The lender just recently reported a record profit of $29 billion after it concluded the Credit Suisse acquisition. While UBS stock is at a 52-week high right now, the shares are trading at only 2.5 times future earnings projections.UBS agreed to buy troubled Credit Suisse this spring at a price of $3.2 billion, which according to Wall Street was a complete steal. UBS finalized the takeover in June, and now has access to Credit Suisse’s large wealth management business. Executives at UBS said that they anticipate costs savings of $10 billion by the end of 2026 as they reduce the size of their workforce. Like the other financial services firms on this list, UBS pays a healthy dividend that yields 2.15%, or a payout of 14 cents a share per quarter.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

Vertex is one of the only pharmaceutical companies in the world with an effective drug for cystic fibrosis, but the market has deemed it a slow-growth company due to existing market penetration. However, the drug is enabling patients to live longer, and the drug’s patient base is growing. Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities. We added to the position after a couple of positive developments this quarter. First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis.

Per the forecast, China is poised to witness demand for 8,560 new commercial airplanes through 2042, buoyed by solid 11.4% growth expected in the nation’s air traffic.Projection HighlightsChina has largely contained the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the air travel demand and is lately witnessing a strong domestic air travel recovery.In light of such factors, Boeing expects China to contribute 20% of global airplane deliveries over the next two decades. The nation’s commercial airliner fleet is projected to surge, exceeding 9,600 aircraft, thus more than doubling its current size over 20 years.The American jet giant further projects that the Chinese commercial aircraft market will need 1,550 widebody airplanes, 190 new freighter deliveries and commercial services valued at $675 billion for maintenance, repair, training and spare parts by 2042.Benefits for BoeingChina remains a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with its Chinese customers, who represent a key component of its commercial aircraft backlog.As Boeing’s report suggests, China’s domestic aviation market is likely to become the world’s largest by 2042, driving the demand for approximately 6,470 single-aisle aircraft like the Boeing 737 Max family of aircraft. Such a strong demand forecast is likely to result in more order inflows for BA, thus boosting its revenue generation prospects.Peer ProspectsApart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that have an established position in the Chinese commercial aviation market and may gain from the flourishing demand are as follows:Airbus EADSY: The company enjoys significant demand in the region, with its service fleet in China rising to more than 2,100 aircraft up to 2023, implying more than 50% of the market.In April 2023, Airbus reached an agreement in the region to expand the A320 Family’s final assembly capacity with a second line at its Tianjin site. The agreement will contribute to Airbus’ overall rate objective of 75 aircraft per month in 2026 throughout its global production network.Story continuesEmbraer ERJ: The company has been recently awarded the Type Certificate by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (“CAAC”) for its E195-E2 jets after the successful approval received from the authority for its E190-E2 in November 2022. The acquired certification by the CAAC is a step forward for the company in fulfilling its commitment to solidifying its position in China’s aviation market.Price PerformanceShares of Boeing have rallied 40.4% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 7.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; a Key PickBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company has so far booked charges of $803 million for the derailment.The White House said Ohio's request for a major disaster declaration remains open and could be approved at a later date. A spokesman for Ohio Governor Mike DeWine declined immediate comment, saying officials were reviewing Biden's order.Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown called Biden's order ""an overdue but welcomed step.""Last month, the Transportation Department's Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) said Norfolk Southern needs ""significant improvements"" in its safety culture and disclosed the agency is considering enforcement actions against the railroad on a number of issues, including track maintenance, inspection, repair practices and hours of service regulations.In May, a U.S. Senate panel approved bipartisan rail safety legislation that tightens rules on trains carrying explosive substances like the Norfolk Southern-operated train, but further action has stalled.Norfolk Southern said Monday it launched an interim program to compensate homeowners around East Palestine who have sold properties at reduced values following the derailment. The railroad has also said it supports addressing long-term health risks through a long-term medical compensation fund and a program to help protect East Palestine drinking water.A U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on the aftermath of the derailment is set for Friday in East Palestine that will include Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated Coca-Cola Consolidated's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Coca-Cola Consolidated's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Impressively, Coca-Cola Consolidated's EPS catapulted from US$29.92 to US$50.96, over the last year. Year on year growth of 70% is certainly a sight to behold.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Coca-Cola Consolidated shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 8.7% to 12%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile profitability drives the upside, prudent investors always check the balance sheet, too.Story continuesAre Coca-Cola Consolidated Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$6.1b company like Coca-Cola Consolidated. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.4b. Coming in at 23% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.Does Coca-Cola Consolidated Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Coca-Cola Consolidated's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Coca-Cola Consolidated for a spot on your watchlist. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Coca-Cola Consolidated by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US stock market and recent developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now.The Two-Day Fed MeetingOn September 19, the US Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting, leaving investors in a state of anticipation over what to expect next. Some argue that the Fed is not likely to hike rates again, while others provide an alternative response. Regardless of which camp ends up being right about this matter, it is indisputable that the Fed's September decision will immensely impact the market and those who hold a stake in it, making this a topic of interest for major stakeholders across the country.CNBC's 'Halftime Report' discussed this topic on September 19. Josh Brown, the CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, was among the experts invited on CNBC to comment on the situation on the ground right now. Here's what he had to say:""If we do still have more hurdles, and even possibly more rate hikes, that's gonna come because of what's going on with oil and gasoline prices - my opinion. You do have the stickiness in wages, you may not have the same rate of inflation but wages aren't going back down. You have the same phenomenon in shelter, particularly in rentals. That's not going back down. That stickiness is with us.""Brown continued to discuss how WTI crude oil and gasoline prices are on the rise at the moment. He noted that historically, recessions have almost always been preceded by ""an oil price shock"" or a ""spike."" However, for him, the recent increases in oil prices are not at that level yet - they have merely moved up gradually. And this factor is why Brown does not believe that the Fed is done with its rate hikes just yet.Where Should Investors Put Their Money?Investors should keep in mind that, at the moment, the markets are still in an unpredictable phase. The fact that the Fed's September decision is also just on the horizon means that investors should be extra careful with where they put their money. Karen Firestone, the CEO of Aureus Asset Management and a renowned portfolio manager, made the following comments on CNBC's 'Halftime Report' with regards to portfolio management:Story continues""What I feel is most important is to have a portfolio that encompasses companies that are going to have earnings growth that's greater than expected. You know, we can start seeing some earnings accelerations. And I think this is the first time in quite a long time that estimates are moving higher.""Companies with high earnings growth can thus be good bets for many investors during the second half of the year. However, another cohort of stocks some should look into is that of beaten-down stocks that have recently hit their 52-week lows. If investors can find a few companies that have proven their worth historically in terms of earnings growth and other fundamentals but are struggling in the market at present, they can probably come up with a portfolio of stocks that are reliable for the future and that can be bought at a bargain right now. Some such stocks include Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). There are many others that we have mentioned in our list below as well.

The analyst also maintained a price target of $240 on the stock.RiverPark Advisors made the following comments about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”Like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Illumina, Inc.

The company offers apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes, among more.Holding 2.9 million shares in the company, Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of the second quarter.Diamond Hill Capital said the following about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We also purchased an ownership stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , the US-based mass retailer. The company has experienced strong traffic growth over the past several years but was disproportionally impacted by poor internal inventory forecasting in 2022, which caused near-term profitability to be negatively impacted. As near-term headwinds subside, we believe Target can restore its margin profile on a sales base that has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The recent stock price sell-off related to near-term controversy concerns allowed us to initiate a position at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. Looking past the next couple of quarters, we believe Target is well positioned to gain share longer-term due to its merchandising acumen, real estate locations and omnichannel capabilities.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now13 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy Now11 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To ConsiderDisclosure: None. 13 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Sempra (NYSE:SRE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Sempra is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$83b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Sempra has an ROCE of 4.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Integrated Utilities industry average of 5.0%. View our latest analysis for Sempra roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sempra compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sempra here  for free.What Can We Tell From Sempra's ROCE Trend?The returns on capital haven't changed much for Sempra in recent years. The company has consistently earned 4.4% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 45% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.The Key TakeawayAs we've seen above, Sempra's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 52% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Sempra (including 1 which is concerning) .While Sempra may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

When people flip the switch, they expect the lights to turn on. Indeed, history shows that bad things can happen if nothing happens following the aforementioned process.Another factor that may lift utilities stocks over other asset classes over the long run is the underlying natural monopoly. Legally, nothing really prevents a newcomer from competing against an established utility service. However, due to the myriad regulations along with the steep barriers to entry, would-be rivals don’t even bother.And therefore, this industry also benefits from a captive audience. No matter what happens in the economy, you’ve got to pay your bills. With that, below are undervalued utilities stocks to buy this month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFirstEnergy (FE)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comBased in Akron, Ohio, FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) is an electric utility. Per its public profile, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the distribution, transmission, and generation of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Moreover, the corporate umbrella represents one of the largest investor-owned utilities stocks in the U.S., serving six million customers.However, despite its pertinence to communities and their local economies, FE hasn’t had a great performance in the charts. Since the January opener, shares stumbled just under 14%. Nevertheless, this red ink could make FE one of the undervalued utilities stocks to speculate on. For example, FE trades at a forward earnings multiple of 13.47X, below the sector median of 13.9x.As for passive income, First Energy offers a forward yield of 4.31%. Enticingly, this rate is above the average yield for utilities stocks at 3.75%. In closing, analysts peg FE as a moderate buy with a $40.43 average price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Story continuesSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comOne of my favorite utilities stocks to discuss, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) doesn’t get much love in this neck of the woods. Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra seems to always find itself raising the ire of its customers. However, that’s also why it’s a great investment. If you want to live in a desirable region of Southern California, you’re going to have to pay up.And you know what? People pay. Yes, we’ve all heard about California’s net migration out of the Golden State. While I wouldn’t call it “fake news,” you must consider the context. While lower-income folks are leaving, higher-income workers are replacing them. By deduction, such a pivot toward quality over raw quantity should help lift Sempra.Trading at only 0.91x tangible book value, SRE happens to be one of the undervalued utilities stocks to buy. Along with that discount, you get a 3.31% forward yield and 19 years of consecutive dividend increases. Finally, SRE is a moderate buy with an $81.95 price target, translating to 14% upside potential.Entergy (ETR)Entergy sign at their headquarters in New OrleansSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAn integrated energy company, Entergy (NYSE:ETR) primarily engages in electric power production and retail distribution operations in the Deep South of the U.S. Per its corporate profile, the company generates and distributes electric power to three million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. As with many other utilities stocks, though, ETR has struggled this year, losing about 11% since the January opener.In the trailing 365 days, ETR slipped more than 18%. However, for contrarians, Entergy could make an enticing case for undervalued utilities stocks. For instance, ETR trades at a forward earnings multiple of 13.52x. However, the sector median value comes in at 13.9X. Also, the company runs at 5.65x operating cash flow, favorably below 67.43% of its peers.For passive income, Entergy commands a forward yield of 4.41%. Along with this generous yield, the payout ratio – while a bit elevated – is quite reasonable at 59.56%. Lastly, analysts peg ETR as a moderate buy with an average price target of $110.86, implying over 14% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(KNSL)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $425.25 in the previous session. Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. has gained 60.9% since the start of the year compared to the 8.2% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 14.8% return for the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 27, 2023, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. reported EPS of $2.88 versus consensus estimate of $2.51 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.88%.For the current fiscal year, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $11.56 per share on $1.21 billion in revenues. This represents a 48.21% change in EPS on a 48.29% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $14.12 per share on $1.53 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 22.16% and 25.92%, respectively.Valuation MetricsKinsale Capital Group, Inc. may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 36.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 14.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 53.1X versus its peer group's average of 15.9X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does KNSL Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of KNSL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Cincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF). CINF has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its main number, which went to hold then voicemail.The discovery has prompted airlines to change parts on a handful of planes and so far only a fraction of the 23,000 existing CFM56 engines has been affected.But Reeve said in court filings that CFM and its engine partners have ""compelling documentary evidence that thousands of jet engine parts have been sold by (AOG) to airlines operating commercial aircraft fitted with the claimants' jet engines"".These include parts for CFM56 engines, built by the GE-Safran joint-venture CFM, and a very small number of CF6 engines used mainly to power cargo planes and manufactured purely by GE.Industry sources said the majority of spare parts sold by distributors like AOG involve small items that are not made by the engine makers themselves and are not considered critical.Story continuesEven so, the number of planes that could have to be taken out of service for checks is approaching 100 and analysts say any disruption to the tightly monitored system of controls underpinning the safety of air travel must be tackled quickly.Reeve said that so far, 86 falsified documents known as release certificates had been identified. By Monday, the number of engines suspected to have parts with forged documents had risen to 96.""Potentially, that means between 48 and 96 aircraft being taken out of service whilst airlines arrange for the parts to be removed,"" Reeve added.'COOPERATING FULLY'The sale of parts with fake or missing release certificates ""potentially puts aircraft safety in jeopardy"" and makes it impossible to verify airworthiness, CFM said in a filing.A release certificate is akin to a birth certificate for an engine part, guaranteeing it is genuine.The engine maker and its French and American parent companies took AOG and its sole director Jose Zamora Yrala to court to force them to hand over documents related to any remaining parts and paperwork linked to CFM56 and CF6 engines since February 2015.They said they were first alerted to the alleged forgery by a Portuguese maintenance and repair company in June, prompting a scramble to discover the extent of the issue.Lawyers representing AOG and Zamora Yrala said the defendants were ""cooperating fully"" with an investigation by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).AOG lawyer Tom Cleaver argued GE did not need a large amount of documents in order to contact possible buyers of the parts.""Everybody now knows that AOG parts are not necessarily to be taken to be the claimants' parts,"" he said.Judge Richard Meade ruled that AOG and Zamora Yrala should disclose ""invoices, release certificates, memos of shipment and purchase orders"" for 230 transactions.CFM welcomed the court order, which it said would help the industry identify unapproved parts more rapidly.CFM56 engines power the previous generation of Boeing 737s and about half the previous generation of Airbus A320s. These are gradually being upgraded but thousands remain in service.The CFM56 is also used on Boeing P-8 maritime patrol planes sold to the United States and Britain, while the GE-built CF6 powers Boeing KC-767A tankers sold to Italy and Japan.There have been no reports of suspect parts on military aircraft.

This marks the first time this controversy has reached a courtroom.AOG Technics, founded by Jose Zamora Yrala in 2015, is under scrutiny from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency for allegedly forging numerous certifications for parts it provided. Yrala has not responded since the scandal was first reported.This scandal has prompted airlines and suppliers to urgently assess its implications, as dubious components have been found on various older single-aisle jets. These findings have led to part replacements, adding further strain to the already stressed spare-parts market.The documentation that General Electric and Safran are seeking includes comprehensive details such as the identity of the part manufacturer and any entity that performed maintenance or repair services on these parts. This information is crucial for the ongoing investigation by the UK's Civil Aviation Authorities and will assist operators in deciding their next steps regarding the spare parts.However, AOG Technics' lawyers argue that this request is excessively demanding and lacks adequate evidence to warrant the removal of all parts from the supply chain. They maintain that the UK's aviation regulator is already investigating the issue and that this demand goes beyond what is necessary for public safety considerations.The situation is serious as some of the counterfeit parts are key components like engine blades, which could pose substantial safety risks if not identified and replaced. CFM International, a manufacturer of CFM56 engines for many older Airbus A320 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 airliners—the most popular category in civil aviation—is particularly impacted by this problem.While AOG has committed to preserving all documents and is actively cooperating with the Civil Aviation Authority, Safran has decided to withhold comments until after the London hearing concludes.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about UnitedHealth Group. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in UnitedHealth Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see UnitedHealth Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 6.2% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.5b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.33 per share, indicating a change of +9.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.88 indicates a change of +12.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $91.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $368.15 billion and $391.28 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +6.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.7%. EPS of $6.14 for the same period compares with $5.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +3.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $36, up from $31. The firm left the company's analyst day ""incrementally confident"" that engagement can continue to ramp, advertising innovation and its full-funnel approach to advertising can deliver improving monetization trends, and adjusted EBITDA margins can expand going forward. DA Davidson also upgraded Pinterest to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $35, up from $25.Wedbush upgraded Wingstop (WING) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $200, up from $180. The firm argues that Wingstop is uniquely positioned within the industry to deliver transaction growth outperformance over the medium- to longer-term beyond the first half of 2024 in any macro backdrop.BMO Capital upgraded Goosehead Insurance (GSHD) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $90, up from $86. The firm sees Goosehead's revenues bottoming at 29% in Q3 and then reaccelerating the following quarter and ultimately stabilizing in the 30%-plus range as a number of headwinds such as low-productive agent culling and overall industry-wide home and auto profits normalize.Argus upgraded Regency Centers (REG) to Buy from Hold with a $70 price target. The firm's upgrade is based on the stock's valuation, an increase in new assets following the August completion of its acquisition of Urstadt Biddle, and improving leasing statistics.TD Securities upgraded Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $78.. The firm cites the ""sharp valuation correction"" since the company's tempered second half of 2023 siding guidance for the upgrade.A Dollar General store in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)Top 5 Downgrades:JPMorgan downgraded Dollar General (DG) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $116, down from $132. The firm notes management sees excess savings for the middle-income cohort on pace to be depleted by the end of fall 2023 and potential for sequential worsening tied to student loan repayments.Oppenheimer downgraded Chewy (CHWY) to Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm expects a more challenging backdrop for Chewy to persist for at least a few more quarters, amid recent signs of weakness in the historically resilient pet food category and the potential for more muted inflation benefits in fiscal 2024.Morgan Stanley downgraded Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $220, down from $260. The firm says growth headwinds challenge the company's growth rebound for next 12-24 months.Raymond James downgraded Ventas (VTR) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $53, down from $55. The firm remains attracted to Ventas' exposure to seniors housing and discounted valuation, though has less conviction after Q2's disappointing seniors housing operating results and increasing concerns over the 2025 Kindred lease maturity that might need to be restructured.Morgan Stanley downgraded nCino (NCNO) to Underweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $24. The company's fiscal 2025 consensus estimates look too high when accounting for recent bookings performance and potential revenue headwinds from recent bank closures, the firm tells investors in a research note.Story continuesWegmans grocery store, Instacart Pick up area with shelves and refrigerators, Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (UCG via Getty Images)Top 5 Initiations: Needham initiated coverage of Instacart (CART) with a Hold rating and no price target. Given slowing growth in the years following a pandemic-driven demand surge and Instacart's ""already scaled"" advertising business, the firm sees a balanced risk reward following the company's IPO.Needham initiated coverage of Lululemon Athletica (LULU) with a Buy rating and $470 price target. The firm expects double-digit sales growth, saying the company's accelerating technical innovation will drive demand across both core franchises and newer play verticals like tennis and golf.RBC Capital initiated coverage of IBM (IBM) with an Outperform rating and $188 price target. The firm is ""optimistic on the competitive positioning and unique role"" that IBM plays in the tech ecosystem.Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Sonos (SONO) with a Buy rating and $20 price target. While there are some near-term headwinds,it is ""only a matter of time"" before demand trends improve, setting the company up for the ""double-barreled benefit"" of revenue acceleration and margin expansion, the firm tells investors in a research note.JMP Securities resumed coverage of CoStar Group (CSGP) with an Outperform rating and $100 price target. As the dominant information and analytics platform within commercial real estate, CoStar is well positioned to continue growing its Multifamily and Residential business lines as it can subsidize aggressive investment with strong profitability and free cash flow from its growing Information &amp; Analytics segment, the firm says.]"
354,c13778fd-3751-3b06-921d-4b6649cb166c,LKQ,2023-09-21,"As the UAW Strike Rumbles on, Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Benefit From the Ongoing Disruption",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-strike-rumbles-2-stocks-084523517.html,1695285923,STORY,"['F', 'LKQ', 'AZO']","[Organized labor strikes are nothing new, they’ve been a part of industry for well over a century now. But the recent move by the UAW, to strike against Detroit’s Big 3 automakers, has taken a new twist – the union is hitting all three at once, after the breakdown of contract negotiations.Specifically, the UAW has initiated strike actions at final assembly plants for Ford, GM, and Stellantis. Labor leaders are flexing their muscles this time, looking to gain back past concessions and to push for higher wage increases in the face of inflation. With a Friday deadline looming, there are concerns that the UAW may expand the strike to engine and transmission plants, as well as final assembly.However this turns out for the Big 3 and their dealership networks, Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Brian Nagel says that the labor dispute offers investors some clear opportunities, writing, “While the wage-related battle between UAW and leading, domestic auto manufacturers remains fluid and could drag on for some time, we tend to view any disruptions within new vehicle production processes as generally positive for used car and auto parts retail.”Getting into more granular detail, Nagel adds, “Near term, labor-related strife at domestic auto OEMs is likely to further impact new vehicle production and hence pricing for autos. Longer term, higher cost infrastructures for auto OEMs could elevate further vehicle prices, thereby bolstering demand for more attractively-priced pre-owned cars and encouraging consumers to keep and maintain vehicles longer.”Taking this as a starting point, we’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on two stocks, both Buy-rated and ones that stand to potentially gain as the UAW strike rumbles along. Here they are, presented along with comments from some of the Street’s top analysts.LKQ Corporation (LKQ)First up on our list is LKQ, a leader in the market for salvaged and recycled auto parts. The company was founded in 1998, on a simple idea that has taken root: car owners and mechanics want lower-cost alternatives to manufacturer-authorized parts when it comes to repairing and accessorizing their vehicles. LKQ stepped into that niche, providing alternative and specialty parts, with an eye on quality and high-value.Story continuesThe company has developed an international footprint, and has operations in 25 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. LKQ can boast 1,600 locations and some 45,000 employees, and its after-market parts have racked up more than 170 million cumulative road miles every year. The company’s largest geographical segments are in North America and Europe, while its largest operating segment is the Specialty business, offering high-end after-market parts and accessories in the US and Canadian markets.Even before the UAW strike, LKQ’s results were impressive. The company posted $3.4 billion in revenue for 2Q23, the last quarter reported, a total that was up 3.3% year-over-year and in-line with analyst expectations. At the bottom line, the $1.09 adjusted diluted EPS came in 1 cent over the forecast.In a metric of particular note to dividend investors, LKQ reported strong y/y gains in its cash flow figures. The company brought in $480 million in operating cash flow and $414 million in free cash flow for 2Q23, compared to $328 million and $288 million in the second quarter of last year. The solid cash flow backed up the firm’s dividend payment, which was declared on July 27 and paid on August 31 at 27.5 cents per common share. That payment annualizes to $1.10 per common share and the 2.2% yield is in-line with peer companies.Watching LKQ for Stiffel, 5-star analyst Michael Hoffman takes note of the company’s cash generation, but is more cognizant of the potential for LKQ to expand its business should the carmakers face a prolonged labor strike. Hoffman writes, “Our investment thesis for LKQ focuses on its breadth of recurring low growth organic sales growth that translates into mid-single or better FCF sustainable CAGR. The LKQ superior fulfillment and market position in the North American and UK and European aftermarket auto parts and services market supports this outlook. The OE parts disruption seen during the pandemic benefited LKQ. By association that would suggest the UAW strike is a benefit. The current rolling, limited UAW strike is not likely to have an impact. However, if the scope widens or the strike persists for a long time then LKQ is likely to see demand for aftermarket parts that would have been fulfilled with OE parts (cars inside warranty periods typically use OE parts).”Looking ahead, the analyst gives the stock a Buy rating with a $66 price target to suggest a one-year upside of 31%. (To watch Hoffman’s track record, click here.)All 4 of the most recent analyst reviews here are positive, making LKQ’s Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The stock is selling for $50.38, and its $66.63 average price target is just a touch above Hoffman’s target and implies a 32% increase for the next 12 months. (See LKQ’s stock forecast.)AutoZone, Inc. (AZO)The second stock we’ll look at is AutoZone, a well-known name – especially for do-it-yourself car buffs. AutoZone is a retailer, and a leader in the niche for aftermarket car parts, accessories, and all the small needs for conducting vehicle maintenance in your own driveway; customers can find everything from brakes and rotors to batteries, and fuel line cleaners to engine coolants.The company has built its business by becoming a one-stop for everyone’s automotive needs, and since being established in 1979, has grown to have a presence in all 50 states plus DC and Puerto Rico, as well as in Mexico and Brazil.In its most recent financial results, released earlier this week for fiscal 4Q23, AutoZone showed an interesting split in its sales growth. Domestic (that is, US) sales posted a modest 1.7% y/y gain in the quarter, while international sales jumped 34%. That fueled a company total of $5.7 billion in revenue, up 6.4% y/y and $80 million ahead of the estimates, with same-store sales increasing 4.5% in a favorable comparison to the 2.5% expectation.At the bottom line, AutoZone reported a diluted EPS, by GAAP measures, of $46.46, compared to $40.51 in the previous year’s Q4. This result was $1.57 higher than had been anticipated.Solid results, pointing toward more growth to come, caught the attention of JPM analyst Christopher Horvers. The 5-star analyst is optimistic about AutoZone going forward, and says of it, “We continue to believe that AZO is positioned for comp acceleration and a modest re-rating off what we view as trough levels (16x FY1). As such, we continue to recommend buying, as trends should improve over the coming year on improved execution, ongoing supply chain and IT initiatives, and the potential for more favorable winter weather in early 2024. Margins remain under control with potential upside in 1Q, with AZO’s capital allocation philosophy adding ~10 pts to EPS growth in FY24.”Quantifying hist stance, Horvers puts an Overweight (Buy) rating here, with a price target of $2,975 to imply a 12-month share price increase of 15%. (To watch Horvers’ track record, click here.)There are 11 recent analyst reviews on AZO shares, with a breakdown of 8 Buys to 3 Holds supporting the Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are currently trading at $2,583.36 and carrying an average price target of $2,844.78, a combination that suggests the stock will gain 10% on the one-year horizon.

CL has been witnessing near-term headwinds related to rising raw and packaging material costs, as well as additional pricing. The incremental pricing actions have been affecting volume trends, which are likely to continue in the near term. Also, the company anticipates a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half of the year.Although the company noted that there has been a gradual recovery in cost inflation across many regions, countries like Turkey, Argentina and Pakistan continue to witness high inflation.These factors are expected to continue posing an uncertain macro environment for the company, thus, hurting sentiment. The effects of these concerns are well evident from the company’s recent price performance.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 5.6% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 0.7%. The company’s shares have also underperformed the sector’s decline of 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 1% in the same period. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Can Innovation Plans Aid?Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the recent relaunch of the Soupline business in France and the launch of Suavitel — the Soupline Hearts. The company is on track with the relaunch of Sanex across Europe. Its Oral Care business has also been performing well, particularly in Africa. Some other notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, as well as the Hello Products LLC buyout.The company recently partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. This long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. This product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices. Further, the new brand will be available in limited countries in the said region.Backed by premium innovation, products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste have been performing well. The company is on track to launch Optic White Renewal and Optify Pro Series in the United States to drive long-term growth. Also, CL’s at-home whitening and professional whitening products bode well.Another trait that puts Colgate on the growth track is its efforts to expand the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. This is one of Colgate’s priorities and has been the key reason to improve organic sales in recent years. The company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands.In 2019, the company expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Colgate has been witnessing positive customer feedback for its elmex and meridol brands, driven by increased investment. Moreover, it is impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists.The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Further, it is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Story continuesWrapping UpAlthough cost and inflation headwinds are likely to persist in the near term, the company’s product innovation, pricing efforts and expansion plans are expected to bring renewed momentum in the stock. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CL’s 2023 sales and earnings per share suggests year-over-year growth of 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Inter Parfums IPAR, Procter &amp; Gamble PG and e.l.f.

358,421bcc31-a66c-34fd-953b-73d6fd404169,PG,2023-09-21,5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Fed's FOMC Meeting Outcome,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-blue-chip-stocks-buy-120800280.html,1695211680,STORY,"['IBM', 'MCD', 'CAT', 'PG', 'WMT']","[Financial markets across the world are keenly waiting for the outcome of the Fed’s September FOMC meeting to be announced today at 2 PM EST. At present, the CME FedWatch is showing that market participants are almost certain that the central bank will keep the Fed fund rate at the existing range of 5.25-5.5% with an assigned probability of 98%. The CME FedWatch is also showing that there exists just 28% chance that interest rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points in the November FOMC meeting.Despite these positives, investors remained concerned about the Fed’s future course of actions in the past one and a half months. Volatility returned to Wall Street in early August after an impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. In this regard, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized word-by-word to find out the future course of the Fed’s monetary policies.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks (components of the Dow 30) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position, and globally acclaimed brand value. Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers, which will act as an income stream during market’s downturn.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five blue-chip stocks with strong upside potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our stock carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19.5% and revenues to rise 7.6%.Story continuesZacks Rank #1 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.9% and 43.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. CAT has a current dividend yield of 1.85%.International Business Machines Corp. IBM is witnessing sales growth in the software segment driven by healthy hybrid cloud adoption and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security. A strong foundation of research and innovation, a broad portfolio that caters to various industry requirements and a diverse global market presence set IBM apart from its competitors.IBM is also poised to benefit from the Watsonx platform. The buyout of Apptio will likely bolster IBM’s IT automation capabilities, empowering enterprise leaders to generate incremental value across the technology domain.Zacks Rank #2 International Business Machines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 1.6% and 3.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. IBM has a current dividend yield of 4.58%.McDonald's Corp.

Strong comps growth globally, expense leverage and e-commerce growth across all units favored the company. WMT raised its guidance for fiscal 2024.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.2% and 2.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. WMT has a current dividend yield of 1.40%.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Cash Cow Stocks to Buy NowThe appeal for cash cows has been on the rise in recent weeks, given the current stock market volatility and uncertainty. Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Amazon.com, Verizon Communications, McKesson Corporation (MCK) and D.R. Horton Inc.. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Story continuesStrong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Current Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors' sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don't cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

SLG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLGSL Green Realty Corp (SLG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 2/10GF Value rank: 9/10Momentum rank: 7/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned SL Green Realty Corp the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.SL Green Realty Corp: A SnapshotSL Green Realty Corp, with a market cap of $2.76 billion, is one of the largest Manhattan property owners and landlords, with interest in around 35 million square feet of wholly owned and joint-venture office space. The company also has additional property exposure through its limited portfolio of well-located retail space. It operates as a real estate investment trust. The company's sales stand at $881.98 million with an operating margin of 16.49%.SL Green Realty Corp (SLG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsFinancial Strength AnalysisSL Green Realty Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company has an interest coverage ratio of 1.05, which positions it worse than 88.7% of 655 companies in the REITs industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.29, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.04 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where SL Green Realty Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -6.1 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 79.02% of 634 companies in the REITs industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Over the past five years, SL Green Realty Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -27.6, while the five-year growth rate is at -8.6. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, SL Green Realty Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.SL Green Realty Corp (SLG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While SL Green Realty Corp has a strong reputation in the REITs industry, its current financial and growth indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its historical performance.

Despite reporting a Loss Per Share of 7.16, the question on many investors' minds is: Is the stock modestly undervalued? In this article, we aim to answer this question by conducting a thorough valuation analysis of SL Green Realty. So, let's delve into the details.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with SLG. Click here to check it out. SLG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLGSL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG) is one of the largest property owners and landlords in Manhattan, with interests in approximately 35 million square feet of wholly owned and joint-venture office space. The company also has a limited portfolio of strategically located retail space. As a real estate investment trust, SL Green Realty has a market cap of $2.80 billion and reported sales of $882 million. The stock price currently stands at $42.95, which we will compare with the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value.SL Green Realty (SLG)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueSummarizing the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.At its current price of $42.95 per share and a market cap of $2.80 billion, SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) is believed to be modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.SL Green Realty (SLG)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. SL Green Realty has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.04, ranking worse than 62.19% of 722 companies in the REITs industry. The overall financial strength of SL Green Realty is 3 out of 10, indicating poor financial strength.Story continuesSL Green Realty (SLG)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. SL Green Realty has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $882 million and a Loss Per Share of $7.16. Its operating margin is 16.49%, ranking worse than 85.2% of 669 companies in the REITs industry. Overall, the profitability of SL Green Realty is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. Growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. However, SL Green Realty's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 79.02% of 634 companies in the REITs industry. SL Green Realty's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -27.6%, ranking worse than 89.37% of 536 companies in the REITs industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also evaluate a company's profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, SL Green Realty's ROIC was 1.26 while its WACC came in at 5.46.SL Green Realty (SLG)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of SL Green Realty (NYSE:SLG) is believed to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is poor, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 89.37% of 536 companies in the REITs industry.

Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-d-r-horton-inc-110024946.html,1695294024,STORY,['DHI'],"[With its stock down 5.4% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to D.R. Horton's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for D.R. Horton is:22% = US$4.9b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.22 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of D.R. Horton's Earnings Growth And 22% ROETo begin with, D.R. Horton has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, D.R. Horton's considerable five year net income growth of 31% was to be expected.Story continuesNext, on comparing D.R. Horton's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 31% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if D.R. Horton is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is D.R. Horton Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?D.R. Horton has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 6.9%, meaning that it has the remaining 93% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, D.R. Horton has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.0% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 17%) over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that D.R. Horton's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Cash Cow Stocks to Buy NowThe appeal for cash cows has been on the rise in recent weeks, given the current stock market volatility and uncertainty. Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Amazon.com, Verizon Communications, McKesson Corporation (MCK) and D.R. Horton Inc.. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Story continuesStrong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Current Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors' sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don't cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Airline Stocks to Buy Now.Air travel industry is in recovery mode with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the opening of the global economy. Unlike in the past three years, there has been a shift with most travelers opting for international travel, something that is helping airlines draw in big revenues from air travel fees and ticket sales.The pandemic brought many challenges as the travel industry came to a standstill. Many airlines plunged into debt and lost a combined $200 billion between 2020 and 2022. It’s only now that most are slowly returning to profitability as they salivate to serve travel-deprived consumers with the easing of travel restrictions worldwide.Major airlines led by United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines continue to rake in huge profits owing to passengers’ willingness to pay higher fares supported by increasing travel demand. The airlines have also benefited from a shortage of airplanes and pilots, allowing them to charge a premium on travel fees without much resentment. Nevertheless, the increase in consumer spending on travel and entertainment remains one of the biggest catalysts for the airline industry.The average cost of flying in the US has increased significantly to historic highs in the industry, bouncing back from the pandemic turmoil. The consumer price index for airline tickets is already up by more than 20% for the year, representing the largest jump since the Federal Reserve started racking the index.Executives from the major airlines expect air travel fares to continue increasing in response to the high demand amid a shortage of planes. Similarly, the executive expects demand for air travel to surge despite the ever-growing risk of recession.Despite the high cost of traveling amid the high inflation and interest rate environment, people continue to make travel arrangements. A Bank of America study showed that spending at airlines and travel agencies is already by more than 60% for the year as more people continue to make travel arrangements.Story continuesNearly two out of every adults plan to take a vacation before year-end, with most shrugging off the rising prices and interest rates.“This year, as prices and interest rates continue to push higher, we’re seeing more signals that vacationers are adapting their plans. Many are still going somewhere, but they’re being more thoughtful about how they’re spending,” said Ted Rossman Bankrate, senior industry analyst The surge in air travel fares has to do with many carriers needing to improve in rebuilding their pre-pandemic flight schedules. A global shortage of aircraft has seen a reduction in aircraft in the tarmacs needed to address the influx of air travel demand. A restricted supply of seats amid high demand is expected to support prices that should allow airlines to continue generating more revenues.On the other hand, the biggest risk to the airline industry is the rising cost of jet fuel. Energy prices have increased significantly in recent months, with crude oil rallying to ten-month highs of $90 a barrel. The increasing energy costs are likely to trigger higher inflation, something that could affect consumer purchasing power, prompting most of them to shelve their travel plans.Nevertheless, the increase in international travel costs due to higher jet fuel could take a toll on the sector that is still in recovery mode from the COVID-19 triggered slowdown. According to Peter McNally of Third Bridge Global Sector lead for Industrials Materials and Energy, airplane capacity issues could become rampant as travel costs soar due to higher jet fuel costs.Some airlines have already started cutting guidance due to the higher fuel costs. For instance, American Airlines expects its Q3 earnings to range between $0.20 and $0.30 a share below the previous guidance of between $0.85 and $0.95. Amid the cuts, most airlines are expected to pass the elevated costs due to high fuel costs, labor issues, and strong dollar to customers owing to the high demand in the market.Waning travel demand is another issue that could batter the sector heading into year-end. Southwest Airlines has already embarked on aggressive marketing campaigns as it looks to get more people booking for its flights.The airline offers triple Companion Pass qualifying points per flight for people looking through its business channels. The easier way to earn the points signifies the ever-growing need to fill seats not just this year but into 2024.11 Best Airline Stocks to Invest In Right NowSource:pixabayDespite the concerns, the air travel industry remains on course to finish the year on a high as airlines continue charging premium fares. As the air travel industry continues to rebound from the pandemic slowdown and airlines report record revenues and profits, tremendous investment opportunities continue cropping up, with most airline stocks trading at highly discounted levels.The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which offers exposure to passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators, is flat for the year, signaling how investors have shunned the sector despite the solid fundamentals.Morningstar expects the operating environment in the US airline sector to continue improving and return to more normalized competitive dynamics once supply constraints moderate. Declining fuel costs in a consolidated industry and robust demand for air travel should offer the much-needed support.Our MethodologyWhile relentless travel demand has sent bookings in major US carriers soaring and leading to bumper earnings, the same is yet to reflect in stock valuations. Most stocks appear to be trading at great discounts, therefore offering a high-risk reward opportunity. We have combined the best airline stocks to invest in, as listed in the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), based on their underlying fundamentals.

371,bdbb2fa9-9da1-3051-a761-cc3bea071161,AAL,2023-09-21,Airline Industry Depreciates 7.1% in Past Month: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-industry-depreciates-7-1-145200165.html,1695221520,STORY,"['SAVE', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[It is a well-documented fact that the stronger-than-expected bounce back of air travel has served as a huge boon for airline stocks. With passenger revenues accounting for most of the top line, airline revenues are moving northwards in the post-COVID-19 scenario.Air travel demand is not only strong on the leisure front (pent-up demand for international travel is the most vital driver of leisure travel), but what is more encouraging is that business travel is coming back as pandemic-related restrictions are removed. Despite the bullish scenario concerning the top line, the Zacks Airline industry has shed 7.1% of its value in a month’s time, against the S&amp;P 500's 0.4% uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the disappointing price performance despite the bright top-line scenario.The northward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for airline stocks. This is because expenses on fuel represent a significant input cost for airlines. Therefore, an increase in fuel costs hurts bottom-line growth. Recently, oil prices crossed the $90-per-barrel mark for the first time since November. The northward movement in crude price is primarily due to the extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year.The sharp rise in one of the primary input costs of airlines is likely to hurt the bottom-line growth of the stocks in the third quarter of 2023. The development has caused key airline stocks, including the likes of American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL and Spirit Airlines SAVE, to increase their September quarter projections for fuel price per gallon.American Airlines’ management stated that “fuel prices have increased considerably since the company’s initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023”. American Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon (including taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). DAL now expects fuel price per gallon in the $2.75 - $2.90 range (earlier guidance: $2.50 - $2.70).Story continuesSpirit Airlines’ management now expects third-quarter fuel cost per gallon to be $3.06, against the earlier projection of $2.80.  United Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range).As if high fuel costs were not enough, labor costs also increase courtesy of the multiple labor deals witnessed in the space. Given the high air-travel demand and the labor crunch in the post-COVID-19 scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has increased.Another headwind has emanated from the devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui. This has affected Hawaiian Holdings HA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the most.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Due to the reduced travel demand to Maui from the U.S. Mainland and Neighbor Islands, HA now expects third-quarter 2023 total revenues per available seat miles to decrease 4-7% from third-quarter 2022 levels (prior projection: 2-5% decline).What’s Ahead for Airlines?With people again taking to the skies, passenger revenues are likely to remain strong. However, costs are likely to stay high, in turn hurting the bottom-line growth of airlines.The International Energy Agency recently said that the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia will lead to a supply deficit through the December quarter. This implies that oil prices will remain high, which is a bane for airlines’ bottom lines. We expect pay-related deals with labor groups to continue, at least in the near term. Consequently, high labor costs are also likely to eat into profitability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Federal Realty Investment Trust's revenue has increased by approximately 2.20% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 56.56% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Federal Realty Investment Trust's earnings increased by approximately 0.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 45.47% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -0.30%, outperforms approximately 33.79% of global competitors.ConclusionGiven Federal Realty Investment Trust's consistent dividend payments, steady growth rate, sustainable payout ratio, strong profitability, and impressive growth metrics, the company appears to be a compelling dividend-paying stock. However, investors should continue to monitor its payout ratio and growth metrics to ensure the sustainability of its dividends.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH.Industry: Medical - HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2152289/5-hospital-stocks-to-watch-amid-improving-industry-trendsCost optimization and technological innovation are aiding the Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players. Their margins are further propelled by easing staffing challenges. Improving market conditions as seniors are now undergoing delayed elective procedures are boosting patient days and occupancies, which, in turn, is aiding hospitals' top line. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme.Technological implementations are expected to offer companies a competitive edge with improved efficiency. Industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corp., Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. and Community Health Systems, Inc. are expected to benefit from these developments.Industry Overview The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends Defining the Hospital Industry's FutureCost Optimization: The rising patient volumes, prices of hospital supplies and inflationary pressures are likely to increase hospitals' operating costs. The improvement in labor and staffing challenges will continue to provide them some breathing room. These companies are expected to increase labor productivity and implement new technologies to optimize expenses. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Technological Advancements: The hospital players are embracing the digital age as technological innovations and wider adoption continue to support growth. This will optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs, increase convenience and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to continue on their growth path.The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis, which will limit patients' waiting time and decrease their treatment costs.Patient Volume Growth: Seniors are now undergoing deferred elective procedures as pandemic-related constraints are fast vanishing. Hence, pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is driving patient volumes. Although inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and similar safety nets can help them navigate through tough times.Rising Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are expected to stimulate constant growth in the senior population. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population.According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, the percentage of this segment is likely to reach 22% by 2050 from 16.9% witnessed in 2020. The change in demographics and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, more people signing up for healthcare plans through the ACA indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy OutlookThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #46, which places it in the top 18% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to buy or watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite, as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this period, the stocks in this industry have gained 17.7% compared with the S&amp;P 500's rise of 14.5%. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 1.5% during this time.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.67X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.29X and the sector's 9.87X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.55X and as low as 5.57X, with a median of 7.81X.5 Stocks Worth Your AttentionBelow we have presented two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and three stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its telemedicine business line is likely to continue increasing the top line. It is well-poised to grow on the back of expanding patient volumes and growing admissions. Its Managed Medicare and Medicaid operations are expected to benefit top-line growth. HCA's inorganic growth strategy enables it to scale its business. It also focuses on boosting shareholders' value with dividend hikes and repurchases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 EPS indicates 9.2% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 6% increase from a year ago. HCA Healthcare beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 5.4%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have jumped 26.8% over the past year.Tenet Healthcare Corporation: The company provides diversified healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare units. It is witnessing growth in Ambulatory Care and Hospital segments, thanks to rising patient volumes and emergency room visits. Its solid USPI performance is a major contributor to the Ambulatory Care unit. Continuous buyouts and tuck-in acquisitions are aiding the company. It also benefits from contractual rate increases in the Conifer unit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THC's 2023 bottom line is pegged at $5.73 per share, which improved 2.3% over the past 60 days. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 5.8% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 25.9%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 23.2% over the past year.Universal Health Services: The company operates acute care facilities, and outpatient and behavioral health care units. It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma, and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. UHS has been gaining traction from higher patient days and an expansive care network. The rising number of licensed beds in acute care hospitals and joint ventures in the behavioral health portfolio is likely to aid its growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health's 2023 bottom line indicates 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals a 5.9% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 4.7%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Shares of the company have gained 32.6% in the past year.Acadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Improving patient volumes, admissions and extension of its service lines into new states are aiding the company's performance. It is on track to add 300 beds to its existing facilities this year and inaugurate six comprehensive treatment centers. However, rising expenses are keeping its margins under check while high debt remains concerning. Though shares of ACHC have declined 14.8% in the past year, its strong operations are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC's 2023 bottom line indicates 12.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 10.4% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 2.8%.Community Health Systems:It is a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the United States. Rising patient volumes, admissions and improved occupancy rates are boosting the company's results. Its focus on telehealth is expected to position the company for long-term growth. Community Health also does not shy away from divesting non-core assets to boost profitability, same-store metrics and cash flow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CYH's 2023 bottom line indicates a 55.1% improvement from a year ago. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals 1.7% growth from the prior year.

The company's revenue had surged from $2 billion in 2013 to over $12 billion in the previous year but faced challenges due to a drop in COVID-19 treatment revenue and increased competition for its top-selling eye medication, Eylea.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a higher dosage of Eylea in August, offering a more optimistic outlook for the company. The drug, previously approved at a 2mg dose, was given the green light for an 8mg injection. This approval came after an initial rejection in June due to issues with a third-party filler. The higher-dose version, now known as Eylea HD, is expected to require fewer injections and has shown similar results to the 2mg version in clinical trials.This introduction of Eylea HD could help Regeneron stave off competition. The original lower-dose treatment was expected to face competition from biosimilars as early as next year. However, the new intellectual property, Eylea HD, will enjoy patent protection which should reduce this risk. The success of this strategy will largely depend on how effectively Regeneron can transition patients from the 2mg version to the 8mg one.Over the past year, Regeneron's sales growth rate has been under pressure. Despite setbacks with its COVID-19 antibody treatment, REGN-COV, proving ineffective against the Omicron variant, Regeneron reported an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue to $3.2 billion for the period ending June 30. This occurred even with a 7% decline in U.S. revenue from Eylea, which totaled $1.5 billion. The reduced selling price of Eylea due to increased competition was a contributing factor. However, the launch of Eylea HD should help counter this and potentially boost the company's overall growth rate.Regeneron has several ongoing trials that could lead to more products entering the market soon, including a ""next-generation"" COVID-19 antibody currently in early-stage trials.Story continuesDespite slightly trailing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 16%, Regeneron shares have appreciated by 14% this year. With a valuation of 22 times earnings, below the industry average multiple of 26, Regeneron may present good value for investors. Market analysts have been raising their price targets for Regeneron following the recent FDA approval, with consensus estimates suggesting an upside of around 10% over the next 12 months. Further upgrades could be on the horizon if the company's performance and outlook improve.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

DGX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid a broad return to care. In the past few quarters, the company made considerable progress in improving the profitability of the base business. However, COVID-19 testing revenues and a competitive landscape are concerning for DGX.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 7.6% compared with the industry’s 0.4% rise and a 11.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $14.09 million. Quest Diagnostics has an earnings yield of 6.92% compared with the industry’s yield of 4.09%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 4.92%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsAccelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well:  Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its two-point business strategy, the first of which is accelerating growth.In light of this, the company recently completed the acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which was announced on the day of the first-quarter 2023 earnings call.  Combining with Haystack puts DGX in a solid position to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. With the post-acquisition integration remaining on track, the company expects to introduce the first MRD test in early 2024. The test will likely be launched from the Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where the solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring was recently introduced. The Haystack acquisition will be modestly dilutive to earnings over the next three years and accretive by 2026.Volume Rebound in the Base Business: Quest Diagnostics is benefiting from solid volume growth across its base business (which refers to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing).The collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians have aided the company in the elevated service demand, which marks a continued return to care. With the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reducing over the past few quarters, the company is making substantial progress in improving the profitability of the base business compared to the pandemic-laden phase up to the first half of 2022.Story continuesUpbeat Guidance:  Full-year net revenue estimates were raised to a new range of $9.12-$9.22 billion (from the earlier band of $8.93-$9.08 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $9.02 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $8.50-$8.90 (up from the earlier projection of $8.45-$8.95). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $8.67.DownsidesLow COVID-19 Testing Revenues Drag the Top Line: Quest Diagnostics posted dismal second-quarter 2023 results, with the top line plunging nearly 88% in COVID-19 testing revenues. Citing this, Diagnostic Information Services reported lower contributions in the quarter despite solid growth in the base business.Competitive Landscape: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition from LabCorp, other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share.While pricing is essential in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including an accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Estimate TrendsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Quest Diagnostics’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $8.67 to $8.70 in the past 60 days.The consensus estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.15 billion. This suggests a 7.5% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and SiBone SIBN.

The retail giant has grappled with the adverse effects of reduced consumer spending, further exacerbated by a recent slump in sales reported for the last quarter. While consumers grapple with the resumption of student loan repayments and summer spending coming to an end, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) is facing new challenges that need to be monitored carefully.Retail Spending Patterns and Economic ConditionsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GPS. Click here to check it out. GPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GPSAs the holiday season approaches, the retail industry finds itself navigating through turbulent economic conditions, with forecasts from Deloitte adding to the prevailing sense of uncertainty. Deloittes holiday sales forecast suggests spending will show a notable deterioration compared to the previous year. Deloitte projects retail sales to see a modest increase ranging between 3.5% and 4.6% compared to the impressive 7.6% growth reported a year ago.While e-commerce is poised to remain a bright spot with projected growth between 10.3% and 12.8% compared to the previous year, the overall sentiment appears subdued. Several factors are exerting pressure on the broader retail landscape. Daniel Bachman, Deloittes U.S. economic forecaster said:Inflation, which accounted for much of the increase in the value of retail sales last year, should moderate. This means the total value of retail sales will grow more slowly than last year. Our forecast also reflects a decreasing pool of pandemic-era savings, both of which will weigh on retail sales and are reflected in our lower projected growth for the season.Consumer Spending and SentimentGap Inc (NYSE:GPS)s troubles are not isolated as they reflect broader economic challenges. High gas prices, interest rate concerns, and the weight of increasing spending toward loan repayments due to higher interest rates are putting a strain on consumer budgets. As inflation began to slow earlier this year, there were hopes of a resurgence in consumer spending. In the second quarter, consumer spending hinted at an uptick, however, the latest data indicates a more cautious approach by consumers with August retail spending painting a mixed picture.Story continuesExcluding sales at gas stations, retail spending edged up by a modest 0.2% in August compared to July, underscoring the challenging outlook for consumer spending. Encouragingly, spending increased across various categories, including restaurants and grocery stores. Yet, the sales of furniture and specialty stores, particularly those selling sporting goods, witnessed a dip of 1% and 1.6%, respectively. A notable anomaly was the flat performance of online retail sales in August after a notable surge in July.Adding to the complexities, U.S. consumer sentiment experienced a modest decline in August driven by growing concerns about inflation and interest rate expectations. According to a survey by the University of Michigan, the overall index of consumer sentiment settled at 69.5 in August, a notable drop from July's 71.6 and also lower than a preliminary reading earlier in the month, signaling a wavering consumer sentiment.Gap Inc's Performance and ChallengesGap Inc (NYSE:GPS), despite being an iconic American clothing retailer, is grappling with a complex set of challenges that have impacted its performance in the second quarter of 2023. In Q2, the company reported net sales of $3.55 billion, marking an 8% decline compared to the same period the previous year. This revenue decline was influenced by an estimated 1-point foreign exchange headwind and a 2-percentage-point negative impact resulting from the sale of Gap China. The latter, which was completed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, had approximately a $60 million negative impact on net sales.While industry-wide online retail sales showed reasonable growth in Q2, Gap's online sales faced headwinds as they decreased by 11% compared to last year. Online sales represented 33% of the total net sales in the quarter, emphasizing the growing importance of e-commerce in Gap's revenue mix.Performance of Gap's BrandsGaps portfolio of brands also exhibited varied performance. Old Navy reported net sales of $1.96 billion, witnessing a 6% decline year-over-year due to softness in the active category and sluggish demand from lower-income consumers. Gap brand's net sales stood at $755 million, down 14% compared to the prior year, primarily attributed to the closure of Yeezy Gap and strategic store shutdowns in North America. Banana Republic and Athleta recorded a year-over-year decline in net sales of 11% and 1%, respectively.Organizational Changes and Market TrendsDespite its position as the second-largest player in the U.S. apparel e-commerce landscape, boasting 1.4 billion online site visits and attracting 600 million in-store visitors each year, the retailer's ability to withstand the challenges ahead remains uncertain. The company's recent organizational changes, aimed at realizing substantial cost savings of approximately $300 million per year, need close attention. Although this move signifies a shift toward a consumer-centric business approach built on a lean business model, new CEO Richard Dickson faces an uphill battle in navigating the transformation.The core of the problem is the company's underperforming brands, notably Old Navy and Gap, which have been losing their competitive edge. Retail analyst at GlobalData Neil Saunders notes that Old Navy's reliance on repetitive seasonal offerings rather than trend-driven innovation, coupled with a cautious consumer environment, creates a challenging dynamic. Similarly, Gap's uninspiring product lineup and high pricing, which calls for frequent discounts, pose challenges to engaging customers effectively.E-commerce Landscape and Consumer BehaviorAddressing the relevance and appeal of Gap's brands in a crowded market appears a priority for the new management to revitalize the company's prospects. However, this will be easier said than done amid the pressures experienced by consumers. Further, Gap has long been intertwined with the fortunes of malls across the United States. However, the retail landscape is undergoing a profound transformation as malls steadily lose foot traffic to the appeal of online shopping.The rapid rise of e-commerce is reshaping consumer behavior on a global scale, with the global e-commerce market projected to be valued at a staggering $6.3 trillion in 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, it's anticipated that a significant 21.2% of total retail sales will be digital. Recent studies underscore the magnitude of this shift. Approximately 218.8 million U.S. consumers are expected to engage in online shopping in 2023, and the categories of clothing and shoes emerge as clear favorites, with 44% and 34% of consumers, respectively, making purchases in these segments.ConclusionAs retailers gear up for the holiday season, the retail landscape appears considerably more challenging than in previous years. Persistently high inflation, deteriorating consumer sentiment, and sector-specific challenges will require agile strategies to navigate successfully. Retailers will need to adapt quickly to changing consumer behavior, potentially rethinking their holiday sales strategies to thrive in this economically uncertain environment.The coming months promise to be a crucial test for the resilience and adaptability of the retail industry. On top of these macroeconomic challenges, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) needs to revive its relevance in a landscape where mall brands have lost their appeal. Historically successful brands such as Old Navy are facing an existential threat today, and investing in Gap seems like a gamble on the success of its turnaround plan rather than a calculated bet on the future of the retail sector.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The company operates a subscription-based pricing model for customers.The two companies have held merger talks in the past, but those discussions fell apart, Reuters has previously reported.Cisco offered $157 in cash for each share of Splunk, representing a 31% premium to the company's last closing price.Splunk's shares were trading up more than 21% at $145.04, below the offer price of $157, reflecting some uncertainty about regulatory scrutiny. Cisco's shares were down 4%.San Jose, California-based Cisco already has a data-security partnership with Splunk, whose more than 15,000 customers include many prominent companies such as Coca-Cola, Intel and Porsche.After a surge in revenue growth last year to nearly 40%, Splunk has grappled with an industry-wide slowdown in demand in 2023 wrought by rising interest rates and sticky inflation.Story continuesIts acquisition will accelerate revenue growth and gross margin expansion at Cisco in the first fiscal year after the deal's close, according to the companies.""Cisco bought a good synergistic business at a good price.

The company operates a subscription-based pricing model for customers.The two companies have held merger talks in the past, but those discussions fell apart, Reuters has previously reported.Cisco offered $157 in cash for each share of Splunk, representing a 31% premium to the company's last closing price.Splunk's shares were trading up more than 21% at $145.04, below the offer price of $157, reflecting some uncertainty about regulatory scrutiny. Cisco's shares were down 4%.San Jose, California-based Cisco already has a data-security partnership with Splunk, whose more than 15,000 customers include many prominent companies such as Coca-Cola, Intel and Porsche.Story continuesAfter a surge in revenue growth last year to nearly 40%, Splunk has grappled with an industry-wide slowdown in demand in 2023 wrought by rising interest rates and sticky inflation.Its acquisition will accelerate revenue growth and gross margin expansion at Cisco in the first fiscal year after the deal's close, according to the companies.""Cisco bought a good synergistic business at a good price. It's a win for both parties,"" said Thomas Hayes, chair of hedge fund Great Hill Capital.

Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words ""will,"" ""believes,"" ""plans,"" ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""estimates,"" ""strives,"" ""goal,"" ""intends,"" ""may,"" ""endeavors,"" ""continues,"" ""projects,"" ""seeks,"" or ""targets,"" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, as well as similar expressions) should be considered to be forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are the management's beliefs and assumptions, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain, and outside of the management's control.  Forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the expected benefits to Cisco, Splunk and their respective customers from completing the transaction, the integration of Splunk's and Cisco's complementary capabilities to create an end-to-end platform designed to unlock greater digital resilience for customers, plans for future investment and capital allocation, the expected financial performance of Cisco following the expected completion of the transaction, and the expected completion of the transaction.

Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from the anticipated results or outcomes indicated in any forward-looking statements.

The parties undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.Splunk Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on Splunk's current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by Splunk and Cisco, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""could,"" ""seek,"" ""see,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""would,"" ""might,"" ""potentially,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""expect,"" ""target,"" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Splunk's business and other conditions to the completion of the transaction; (ii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Splunk's business and general economic conditions; (iii) Splunk's ability to implement its business strategy; (iv) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction; (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; (vi) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Splunk's business, including current plans and operations; (vii) the ability of Splunk to retain and hire key personnel; (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Splunk's business; (x) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xi) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Splunk operates; (xii) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect Splunk's financial performance; (xiii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Splunk's ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xiv) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Splunk's response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the proxy statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy statement will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Splunk's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Splunk does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.Non-GAAP InformationThis press release includes future estimated non-GAAP EPS information. Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. We have not reconciled future estimated non-GAAP EPS information included in this presentation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort because we do not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.Additional Information and Where to Find ItIn connection with the proposed transaction and required stockholder approval, Splunk will file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement and a definitive proxy statement. The proxy statement will be mailed to the stockholders of Splunk. Splunk's stockholders are urged to carefully read the proxy statement (including all amendments, supplements and any documents incorporated by reference therein) and other relevant materials filed or to be filed with the SEC and in their entirety when they become available because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties to the transaction.
