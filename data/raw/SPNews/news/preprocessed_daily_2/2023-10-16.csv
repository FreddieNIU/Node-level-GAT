It is truly humbling to see our clients award us with near-record Client Promoter Scores and allow us the privilege to help them move toward their financial goals – particularly during a period where the U.S. government narrowly avoided a shutdown, major equity markets posted a quarterly loss, and long-term interest rates touched levels not seen in many years. Third parties also continue to recognize the firm, with Investor’s Business Daily naming us one of its most trusted financial services firms and Charles Schwab Bank as its most trusted bank for 2023.""Story continues""By seeing ‘through clients’ eyes’ for the last 50 years, we have earned consistent confidence from investors that helps power our strong organic growth,"" continued Mr. Bettinger. ""During the third quarter, we gathered $46 billion in core net new assets, including $27 billion in September following the completion of our latest Ameritrade client conversion cohort. While expected deal-related attrition has temporarily weighed on net new asset flows, our underlying growth recipe remains very much intact. Year-to-date, we have attracted $248 billion of core net new assets from accounts originally opened at Schwab – an annualized Schwab originated organic growth rate of over 6%. As of September 30, investors have entrusted us with a total of $7.82 trillion in client assets across 34.5 million accounts.""Mr. Bettinger added, ""Over Labor Day Weekend, we successfully completed the single largest conversion event in our industry’s history. During those three days, we transitioned $1.3 trillion in client assets – including more than 7,000 Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) served by the Ameritrade Institutional business and 3.6 million retail accounts. The thoughtful planning and relentless dedication of our employees helped ensure there were no significant disruptions to the client experience and overall service levels remained strong – including answering client calls in under 1 minute. We have now converted approximately 80% of Ameritrade client assets and accounts, with deal-related attrition tracking markedly better than our initial expectations. In addition to these favorable retention trends, engagement levels across recently converted clients has also picked up – including positive new account formation and net asset flows across both Retail and RIA clients.""Mr. Bettinger concluded, ""Concurrent with progressing the Ameritrade integration, we remain focused on further enhancing Schwab’s modern wealth platform by advancing our key strategic initiatives of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, and segmentation. We have identified a number of opportunities for increased efficiency, including capturing the remaining deal expense synergies, streamlining our operational design, aligning our geographic footprint to match our hybrid workforce, and harnessing the benefits of increased automation. Once fully implemented, we expect these actions to deliver at least $1 billion of incremental annual expense savings. Even as we seek to improve upon our industry leading cost structure, we are continuing to enhance our segmented offering for the broad range of clients we serve. For clients seeking assistance with their portfolios, our wealth management solutions attracted year-to-date net flows of $24 billion – including record flows into Schwab Wealth Advisory™, Wasmer Schroeder™ Strategies, and Schwab Personalized Indexing®. At the same time, Schwab is expanding the suite of tools and resources available to self-directed investors to help them achieve better financial outcomes. Today we announced the launch of our new end-to-end trader experience that combines access to thinkorswim® with curated education for all levels and specialized service and support. This offer is tailored to meet the specific needs of a highly engaged client group that on average maintains approximately 4x more assets at the firm relative to other retail households while also utilizing a broad array of other products offered across Schwab. Continuing to invest in our platform allows us to meet the evolving needs of investors, while keeping us positioned for sustained growth over time.""CFO Peter Crawford noted, ""Our continued success with clients and diversified model helped produce third quarter net revenues of $4.6 billion. This result represents a 16% decline from last year’s record period, primarily driven by the temporary utilization of higher cost funding, lower interest-earning assets, and softer trading volumes. Net interest revenue was down 24% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, reflecting the impact of client allocation decisions within a higher interest rate environment. However, cash realignment activity decelerated further during the quarter – even with the brief uptick in August and an increase in long-term interest rates. September was particularly strong as net outflows from transactional cash were lower than any prior monthly period this cycle and bank sweep deposits increased month-over-month for the first time since March 2022. Additionally, the combination of ongoing interest in Schwab’s proprietary fund products, growth in no-transaction fee platform balances, and strong flows into our advised solutions pushed asset management and administration fees to a quarterly record of $1.2 billion, up 17% versus the prior year.""""We maintained Schwab’s balanced approach to expense management while successfully reaching another key checkpoint in the Ameritrade integration effort,"" added Mr. Crawford. ""GAAP expenses were up 14% to $3.2 billion, including $106 million in acquisition and integration-related costs, $135 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, and $279 million in costs related to our previously announced restructuring. Exclusive of those items, adjusted total expenses (1) equaled $2.7 billion, or a year-over-year increase of 5%. Pre-tax profit margins finished the quarter at 30.0%, or 41.3% on an adjusted (1) basis – the 12th consecutive quarter above 40%.""Mr. Crawford concluded, ""During the quarter, our balance sheet management continued to prioritize flexibility in support of our growing client base. In late August, we issued approximately $2.4 billion of senior notes across two tranches due in 2026 and 2034, further bolstering our diversified liquidity profile. Schwab’s consolidated balance sheet totaled $475 billion at quarter-end, down 7% sequentially, as available net cash flows from our investment portfolio were used to pay down supplemental borrowings. Our capital levels also continued to build during the quarter as our consolidated Tier 1 Leverage ratio increased to 8.2% and our Adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (1) expanded by more than 40 basis points to 4.1%. Ratios at Charles Schwab Bank, SSB (CSB) followed a similar trajectory with CSB Tier 1 Leverage increasing to 9.6%, or 4.4% on an adjusted (1) basis. As we move towards a new year, our consistent strategy, key competitive advantages, and ‘through the cycle’ financial model keep us well-positioned to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders.""(1)Further details on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results are included on pages 10-12 of this release.Commentary from the CFOPeriodically, our Chief Financial Officer provides insight and commentary regarding Schwab’s financial picture at: https://www.aboutschwab.com/cfo-commentary.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONNon-GAAP Financial Measures(In millions, except ratios and per share amounts)(Unaudited)In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), Schwab’s third quarter earnings release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.Schwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, these adjustments also include restructuring costs, which the Company began incurring in connection with its previously announced plans to streamline its operations to prepare for post-integration of TD Ameritrade. See Part I – Item 1 – Note 10 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 for additional information.Non-GAAP Adjustment or MeasureDefinitionUsefulness to Investors and Uses by ManagementAcquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring costsSchwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses.Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives.We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring costs for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab’s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods.Costs related to acquisition and integration or restructuring fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions, integration and restructuring activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company’s underlying operating performance.Return on tangible common equityReturn on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets — net, and related deferred tax liabilities.Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab’s balance sheet.Adjusted Tier 1 Leverage RatioAdjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio represents the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio as prescribed by bank regulatory guidance for the consolidated company and for CSB, adjusted to reflect the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the ratio.Inclusion of the impacts of AOCI in the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provides additional information regarding the Company’s current capital position. We believe Adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s capital levels.The Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.The tables below present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2023202220232022Total Expenses Excluding InterestNet IncomeTotal Expenses Excluding InterestNet IncomeTotal Expenses Excluding InterestNet IncomeTotal Expenses Excluding InterestNet IncomeTotal expenses excluding interest (GAAP), Net income (GAAP)$3,223$1,125$2,823$2,020$9,194$4,022$8,475$5,215Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)(106)106(101)101(334)334(291)291Amortization of acquired intangible assets(135)135(152)152(404)404(460)460Restructuring costs (2)(279)279——(279)279——Income tax effects (3)N/A(127)N/A(62)N/A(247)N/A(183)Adjusted total expenses (non-GAAP), Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)$2,703$1,518$2,570$2,211$8,177$4,792$7,724$5,783(1)Acquisition and integration-related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consist of $52 million and $158 million of compensation and benefits, $37 million and $111 million of professional services, $7 million and $21 million of occupancy and equipment, and $4 million and $26 million of other. Acquisition and integration-related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily consist of $57 million and $166 million of compensation and benefits, $36 million and $102 million of professional services, and $6 million and $14 million of occupancy and equipment.(2)Restructuring costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consist of $276 million of compensation and benefits.

To do so, we must identify the new opportunities that are presenting themselves within the sector and take advantage of the boom of these new companies that are doing an incredible job with excellent results. Here are three semiconductor stocks to make you rich; let’s analyze them.Semiconductor Stocks: Microchip Technology (MCHP)Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuitsSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is a leading semiconductor technology company. In essence, they design the technological “brains” that run a wide range of devices, from your smartphone to industrial machinery, making them more efficient and safer.Why is it so attractive to investors? In their latest financial report, they announced impressive results. Their revenue reached a record $2.289 billion, a significant increase over the previous year. In addition, they posted record earnings in both GAAP and non-GAAP terms, demonstrating their financial strength.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrochip is also at the forefront of technology. In collaboration with GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS), they launched a memory technology called SST ESF3, which is fast and versatile, perfect for applications such as secure code storage and over-the-air updates.But that’s not all. The company is investing $300 million to expand its operations in India, a fast-growing market in the semiconductor industry. This not only strengthens its position but also contributes to the development of the global semiconductor industry.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a leading company in the semiconductor industry. Their versatility and presence in various industries make them an attractive option for investors.Story continuesRecently, they reported second-quarter revenue of $4.53 billion, with net earnings of $1.72 billion, which translates to earnings per share of $1.87. Despite market challenges, they managed to grow revenue by 3% sequentially, which shows their resilience.What makes them stand out is their strong financial position. They generated $7.4 billion in operating cash flow last year and have a free cash flow of 17% of their revenue. This demonstrates their financial stability and resilient business model.In addition, they consistently invest in research and development, allocating approximately $3.6 billion a year to stay on the cutting edge of technology. They also reward their shareholders with regular dividend increases, such as the recent 5% increase.Their long-term vision is evident in their $1.6 billion bond issue, intended to fund future corporate projects.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor.

6,4f354c43-7c9a-3015-a534-2a3af15e8b32,NUE,2023-10-16,7 Materials Stocks Ready to Make Some Major Moves,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-materials-stocks-ready-major-154222604.html,1696866142,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'FCX', 'NUE', 'ALB', 'SHW', 'SCCO']","[Long-term investors frequently buy into sectors that are underperforming the market in the current year. History suggests that cyclical factors can provide a catalyst for those stocks to outperform the market the following year. That laggards-to-leaders strategy establishes the premise for finding materials stocks to buy as 2023 ends.As of October 5, 2023, the materials sector was up about 0.6% for the year. That’s far below the S&amp;P 500, which is up about 11% for the year. And that’s even with the recent sell-off.One reason for the sector’s relatively lackluster performance is the breadth of this sector. It includes construction materials and steel, which are performing well this year. But it also includes metals and mining stocks that are affected by commodity prices and chemical stocks. All of these sectors have headwinds related to a slowing economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith many economists forecasting a recession in early 2024, the recovery may still be several quarters away. However, materials stocks will be among the first to recover. That’s why now may be a good time to consider starting a position in these materials stocks.Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comMining stocks make up part of the materials sector, and Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) is one of the top mining stocks to consider for the coming quarters. The Phoenix, Arizona-based company is the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.That’s been a mixed blessing for FCX shareholders. Copper demand has not been as robust as expected, and the price of copper is down more than 6%. Not surprisingly, FCX stock is down by virtually the same percentage.However, in the company’s second-quarter earnings report in July 2023, Freeport McMoran’s chief executive officer (CEO) Richard Adkerson noted that global copper inventories remain low while demand remains strong.The takeaway is the same as it was earlier this year. Unless global governments retreat from their focus on renewable energy, copper demand will likely surge, and with it, the price of copper. That will allow investors to focus on the company’s strong balance sheet and outlook for earnings, which are expected to climb by 34% from $1.61 to $2.16 per share.Story continuesSouthern Copper (SCCO)Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockSouthern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) is another way to invest in the expected surge in copper demand. The company has over $89 million in copper reserves. This is largely due to its massive footprint in Peru, which holds about 13% of the world’s copper. In September, the company forecasted an increase in Peruvian copper production to 400,000 metric tons – a 17% year-over-year (YOY) increase.However, unlike Freeport-McMoran, SCCO stock is up 19% in 2023. But the stock is down 9% in the last month. This may explain why the stock has a consensus Sell rating despite projecting earnings growth of 22% in the next year. It didn’t help that the company missed on both the top and bottom lines in its most recent earnings report.Analysts may feel that all that growth is priced in. On the other hand, the miner does come with an attractive dividend that currently yields 5.58% and pays out $4 per share on an annual basis.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comThe last metal and mining stock on this list of materials stocks to buy is Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). The bullish case for Albemarle has to do with the expected growth in demand for lithium. Along with copper, lithium will be needed as a base metal for many of the most in-demand technologies, such as EV batteries and renewable energy storage.There are many ways for investors to invest in lithium. Albemarle is one of the safest if you want growth over time. Unlike copper, there are concerns that the world is facing an oversupply of lithium. That may be reflected in the ALB stock price, which is down 28% this year.On the other hand, Albemarle is forecasting a 17% drop in earnings from $25.90 to $21.48. That’s in contrast to analysts who have a consensus price of $257.86 for ALB stock, a 66.3% increase from its closing price on October 5, 2023.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comA company whose primary business is industrial gases is a logical choice to make a list of materials stocks to buy. However, that’s only part of the story behind Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD). The company generates over 3 billion cubic feet of hydrogen every day. That makes it one of the world’s leading producers of hydrogen.Of course, investors have been talking about the hydrogen revolution for several years. It would be easy to dismiss this moment as yet another example of when “this time is different” wasn’t different. However, the company continues building partnerships that suggest hydrogen demand will match the hype.Besides, that’s only one source of revenue for the company, which continues to beat earnings estimates year-over-year. And in the coming year, the company expects earnings to grow by 12%. That corresponds to the 14% increase in the APD stock price being forecast by analysts.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) presents investors with what may be a no-lose scenario. The company’s revenue and earnings increased sharply as demand for steel increased in 2020 and 2021. However, as demand normalizes, Nucor is finding it harder to meet revenue estimates. And the company is now forecasting that it may also start missing earnings projections.That suggests that investors may want to place more importance on the 7% decline in NUE stock in the last 30 days as opposed to the 18% increase in the stock so far in 2023. On the other hand, at the end of 2022, Nucor joined the exclusive ranks of Dividend Kings. This is marked by companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.That dividend currently pays $2.04 per share on an annual basis. That means that investors who bought the stock for growth may now want to hold the stock for the income it provides. And the company is also rewarding its shareholders with a $4 billion share repurchase plan.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) is North America’s largest paints and coatings manufacturer. The company blew away forecasts on the top and bottom line in its second-quarter earnings report in July 2023. However, that’s not reflected in the price of SHW stock, which is down nearly 2% in the last three months.But that highlights an attractive feature of the company’s stock. It’s a low-beta stock, which means it will generally drop less when stocks are under pressure. The company also offers investors with an attractive dividend.Of course, the stock may not have an impressive yield (it’s only 0.95%), but it’s grown the dividend an average of 19% over the last three years.Sherwin-Williams is also a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years. That combination of a low beta value and an attractive dividend makes Sherwin-Williams an easy pick as one of the more compelling materials stocks to buy.Bunge Limited (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comFor the last stock on this list of materials stocks to buy, I’m looking at the agriculture sector, and one of the leading names is Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG). The company is vertically integrated, with operations stretching from farmers to consumers.The company is one of the leading providers of agricultural commodities such as wheat and sugar. And in June, the company merged with Viterra, the agriculture division of Glencore. This will allow the company to capture more of the global agricultural demand and increase the company’s earnings outlook.That would be welcome news to shareholders. The company is projecting earnings to drop 4% in the next year. BG stock is down 8% in the last month after being up 18% in the last year. However, analysts give the stock a Moderate Buy rating with a 22% upside.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in FCX.

It’s a pivotal discourse as Wall Street recently took a significant tumble, shedding light on the downside of a seemingly robust job market.As the S&amp;P 500 cascaded to a sobering four-month low, the focus is towards low-volatility strategies. The shifting focus embodies a pragmatic approach that seeks to navigate through the windstorms. Even while stocks have waned under the mighty pressure from climbing Treasury yields in the bond market, these low-volatility maneuvers were crafted to minimize losses during these market troughs while enabling opportunities for upside. With that said, let’s look at seven stable stocks that should help you ride out the market volatility with aplomb.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is effectively defying the gloom of the recession, sparkling as a stronghold in the retail sphere and emerging as a stable pick during economic downturns. The latest data gleams with optimism, revealing a promising landscape where factors including employment stability and disinflation are elegantly dancing with wage increases, sculpting a favorable environment for consumer behavior.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPeering into Walmart’s eCommerce and marketplace segments, a blossoming picture shows a robust 35% surge in advertising within the marketplace, a growing digital bazaar showing a staggering selection of approximately 400 million items. Moreover, the diligent stride of Walmart+, coupled with other membership initiatives, weaves a tapestry of personalized marketing and data, pivoting toward organic repeat customers.Investors might take comfort in knowing that the company’s earnings have comfortably beaten market expectations in the past four consecutive quarters. Thus, its metamorphosis into a beacon of reliability enables the firm to effectively stand as a historical and present reality, offering a semblance of stability.Story continuesPepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comNavigating the fickle terrains of the stock market, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stands tall, etching its mark as one of the most resilient stocks to consider in anticipation of a recession. Its robust financial positioning, diverse product spread, and insatiable appetite for innovation highlight its prowess to navigate and shine amidst recessionary clouds. The allure of PEP stock is undeniable, with it trading at a sensible 21.4 times Non-GAAP future earnings, boasting a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, translating to a generous yield above 3%.The crescendo of confidence reaches its peak with its second-quarter Non-GAAP EPS of $2.09 effortlessly overshadowing expectations by 13 cents. Revenues sizzle at $22.32 billion, surpassing forecasts by a whopping $590 million. Raising the performance bar, PepsiCo now projects an even brighter 2023, foreseeing a 10% organic revenue growth, a hike from its initial 8% outlook, and a 12% core constant currency EPS growth, marking a considerable leap from its prior 9% estimate.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comIn the vast digital cosmos, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to radiate brilliance with its unwavering growth and a vision set on the horizons of artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and other tech verticals.Furthermore, the company figures tell a compelling tale. With a stellar year-to-date return of 36.5%, the Redmond-based juggernaut unveils a sparkling fourth quarter report card which showed a net income vaulting up by 20% to touch $20.08 billion, and revenues clocking in at a robust $56.2 billion, marking an 8% year-over-year ascent. This performance not only trumps earnings expectations with a 5.6% surprise, but it paints the portrait of a company flourishing and evolving.The grand narrative is further enriched by Microsoft’s aggressive foray into AI, underscored by its hefty $10 billion plunge into OpenAI, the ingenious minds behind ChatGPT. This strategic alignment, mirrored in integrations from Bing to expansive applications, showcases a harmonious blend of technology, bridging domains from the vast cloud to the vibrant gaming arena.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Cintas' (NASDAQ:CTAS) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Cintas, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$1.9b ÷ (US$8.7b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2023).Thus, Cintas has an ROCE of 25%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.5% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cintas compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCintas has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 62% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Our Take On Cintas' ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Cintas has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Cintas   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Today, Walmart still maintains its roots as a discount retailer, offering affordable prices on a wide variety of everyday goods ranging from home and furniture to electronics, apparel and groceries. It even has a strong online presence and has become an e-commerce giant in its own right.Check Out: 5 Ways To Elevate Your Finances DailySee More: 10 Walmart Brand Grocery Items That Are Now Cheaper at AldiIf you’re looking to shop at Walmart but want to make sure you’re optimizing both your time and money, it’s important to plan your shopping trip around specific days. These are the best and worst days to shop at this retailer, as well as a few money- and time-saving strategies to implement on your next trip.Best Days To Shop at Walmart: Tuesdays and WednesdaysThe best days to shop at Walmart are generally in the middle of the week — like Tuesdays and Wednesdays.“Generally, weekdays, particularly Tuesday and Wednesday, are the best days to shop at Walmart,” said Tommy Mello, a home service expert and founder of A1 Garage Door Service. “During these days, stores are less crowded, resulting in a more comfortable and efficient shopping experience. Furthermore, some businesses may begin their weekly specials and rollbacks on these days, thus the best deals are generally found early in the week.”Going in the morning on these days can also give you the best shopping experience.“A weekday morning, especially mid-week like Wednesday, is a great time to shop at Walmart,” said Melissa Cid, consumer savings expert for MySavings.com. “You’re more likely to encounter a less busy store, stocked shelves and fresh produce and meats. Mid-week is when the store is caught up on restocking from the weekend crowds.”Story continuesRead: Don’t Shop at Dollar Tree on This Day of the WeekWorst Days To Shop at Walmart: Saturdays and SundaysMany major retailers become busier and more crowded on the weekends, and Walmart’s no different. Given this, it’s generally best to avoid shopping on Saturdays or Sundays.“Saturday and Sunday is the worst day to shop at Walmart,” said Cid. “On the weekends, you’ll be battling a busy store, long lines and possibly empty shelves and slim pickings on fresh foods.”“Many individuals do their weekly shopping on these days, resulting in greater crowds and longer checkout queues,” added Mello. “By avoiding these peak shopping hours, you can make your visit more enjoyable.”Strategies To Save Money and Time at WalmartIn addition to planning your shopping trip around certain days of the week, there are other ways to maximize your money and time. Here are some of the big ones.Shop at the Beginning of the MonthIf you’re looking for additional savings and discounts, head to Walmart early in the month.“In my experience, the best days to shop at Walmart are during the first five days of the month,” said Athina Zisi, chief operations officer of Energy Casino. “That’s when you can find newly discounted items and clearance deals right at the beginning of the month.”Samantha Landau, consumer expert at TopCashback.com, added, “Head to Walmart first thing on weekdays to get the best selection of perishable goods, and the best clearance deals before they sell out, as well… Another time to consider is at the beginning of the month — Walmart often has plenty of markdowns from the previous month that they try to get rid of at the beginning of the next month.”Get a Walmart+ MembershipA Walmart+ membership comes with many perks that non-members don’t get, including free home delivery, free shipping on all orders, fuel rebates and more. If you’re a frequent shopper, becoming a member could lead to some great savings.“I personally love the Walmart+ membership,” said Cid. “I get a lot of value out of Walmart+ with their free shipping, no minimum spend required! I’ve picked up clearance items on their website for as low as $0.50 shipped! You can also order same-day grocery delivery for free. You just need to tip the driver.”Use Cash BackWalmart offers cash back on select purchases. For example, the retailer has up to 5% cash back on travel-related goods for members.“Look for products online or in the app that offer Walmart cash back,” said Cid. “These are manufacturer offers available on select products. When available, clip the manufacturer offer to add it to your Walmart account. When you buy online or in-store, you’ll score Walmart cash that you can use for a future product or cash out in store for real money once you hit $25.”Take Advantage of Price MatchingMany major retailers, including Walmart, offer price matching on items sold storewide.“Walmart has a price match policy that states that they will match the quoted price of identical items from local competitors. This might help you save money by ensuring you get the best price possible,” said Mello.You could secure additional savings by using the Walmart Savings Catcher app.“Scan your receipts with the Walmart Savings Catcher app,” said Mello. “If a competitor in your area provides a cheaper price on an item you purchased, the difference will be credited to your Walmart eGift Card.”Shop Late at NightWhile some Walmart locations used to be 24/7, these stores are few and far between. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still benefit from shopping late at night. Weekday nights in particular tend to be a great time to score some deals and shop without many people around.“If you are looking for deep discounts, you’ll want to shop at Walmart on a weekday evening,” said Cid. “This is when markdowns for the next day happen with savings of 30%-50% off stickers on many soon-to-be expiring foods from the bakery, produce and meat departments.”More From GOBankingRatesGrant Cardone: Passive Income Is the Key To Building Wealth -- Here's My No. 1 Tip10 of the Most Valuable Pennies3 Ways to Recession Proof Your RetirementExperts Share the 6 Best Money Moves To Make Before RetiringThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Don’t Shop at Walmart on This Day of the Week]"

(NYSE:NKE) has succeeded after five years of research and development. Made using an injection molding process instead of a compression molding process, the ReactX foam offers a 13% increase in energy return to the runner. Energy return is a key goal for any performance foam. Like everyone else, athletes lose energy with every step, which makes it harder to keep going. A foam that returns energy to the runner can help athletes achieve faster times or simply feel better during their workouts.NIKE, Inc.

(but) will likely remain under the shadow of mounting geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has returned to Israel after talks in six Arab states, hoping to coordinate efforts against Hamas while finding ways to alleviate Gaza's humanitarian crisis.Four days after he paid a lightning visit to Tel Aviv to show solidarity with Israel, Blinken flew back and went straight to talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Jerusalem office.Story continuesAs Israel prepares what is expected to be a major ground operation in the Gaza Strip, Blinken met Netanyahu's security cabinet.""The key uncertainty is whether a ground operation risks widening the conflict, with markets focused on whether Iran and its allies are drawn into the conflict,"" said National Australia Bank's Tapas Strickland.Adding to unease were reports that the White House will tighten rules on Chinese access to semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment, maintaining a long-running security standoff between the superpowers despite moves to ease tensions.Traders will be keeping a close eye on speeches this week by several Federal Reserve decision-makers, including boss Jerome Powell, hoping for some idea about their plans for interest rates.The talks come after a number of US Fed officials in recent weeks suggested the central bank could hold rates steady at its next meeting, soothing concerns about more tightening that some observers fear could flip the world's biggest economy into recession.- Key figures around 2050 GMT -New York - Dow: UP 0.9 percent at 33,984.54 points (close)New York - S&amp;P 500: UP 1.1 percent at 4,373.63 (close)New York - Nasdaq: UP 1.2 percent at 13,567.98 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.4 percent at 7,630.63 (close)Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.3 percent at 15,237.99 (close)Paris - CAC 40: UP 0.3 percent at 7,022.19 (close)EURO STOXX 50: UP 0.3 percent at 4,149.86 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.0 percent at 31,659.03 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.0 percent at 17,640.36 (close)Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.5 percent at 3,073.81 (close)Brent North Sea crude: DOWN 1.4 percent at $89.65 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.2 at $86.66 per barrelEuro/dollar: UP at $1.0562 from $1.0513 on FridayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2218 from $1.2138Dollar/yen: FLAT at 149.53 yen from 149.53 yenEuro/pound: DOWN at 86.42 pence from 86.58 penceburs-rl/ach/bys/mdl]"

They were last trading at $89.65 a barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, briefly rose to $87.98, compared with Friday’s closing price of $87.68. It was last trading at $86.50.Growing risk of escalationStill, investors are concerned the Israel-Hamas war could spark a wider conflict in the oil-rich region and further tighten global oil supply.Both futures had surged Friday, after Israel’s military warned more than 1 million people to leave northern Gaza, triggering worries about a potential ground offensive by Israel in retaliation for terror attacks by Hamas that killed at least 1,400 people.Speaking to CBS Sunday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that, while there was no new intelligence that the threat level from Iran had changed, “there is a risk of an escalation of this conflict.”Analysts at ANZ Research expect oil prices to hit $100 a barrel in the short term because of the growing risk of regional escalation.Neither Israel nor Gaza is a significant oil supplier, but the risk to oil markets will rise if “the conflict broadens,” they wrote in a research note Friday.“If [Iran] becomes involved, up to 20 million barrels per day of oil could be at risk of disruption directly and through obstructed logistics,” they added.The “Middle East risk” is dominating the landscape for global asset prices, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.Story continues“The ongoing conflict could weigh even further on the global oil supply over time by potentially reducing the probability of Saudi-Israeli normalization and posing downside risks to Iranian oil production, leading to a further surge in oil prices,” he said.Global oil prices had risen since late June as production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia fueled worries about reduced global supply. New US measures, unveiled last week, aimed at raising the cost of Russia’s attempts to skirt a cap on the price of its oil might have also driven oil prices higher.In currency markets, the shekel weakened Monday, hitting less than 4 per US dollar for the first time since 2015. The Israeli currency has tumbled close to 4% in the past 10 days.Israel’s central bank said last week that it planned to sell up to $30 billion of foreign exchange to stabilize the shekel after it fell sharply following the Hamas attacks.US stocks, meanwhile, closed higher on Monday as investors appeared to shrug off fears of growing geopolitical tension in the Middle East. The Dow closed 314 points, or 0.9%, higher; the S&amp;P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%.— Nicole Goodkind contributed to this story.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

As oil and gas prices collapsed during the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic, then-Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden slashed the company’s dividend by two thirds, accelerated its shift to cleaner forms of energy and pledged to hit net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Van Beurden’s successor in the top job, Wael Sawan, has maintained the mid-century carbon target but is directing a greater proportion of the company’s investment into oil and gas. He is seeking to win over investors with higher returns stemming from a “ruthless” focus on performance and financial discipline.The rally in Shell shares has been driven by higher commodity prices, particularly for natural gas in Europe, “and the strategic changes announced by the new CEO in June, which is likely drawing in more investors,” said Morningstar analyst Allen Good.However, Good points to “currency issues” as also being part of Shell’s rise. “US dollar-based shares remain below their highs, so part of the move is lower pound and euro.”(Updates with closing share price in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But Israel denied these, bombardment of the enclave resumed and the unfolding conflict continues to loom large over an otherwise packed events diary this week.For investors, crude oil continues to be most sensitive to the risk of widening regional war and most capable of emitting shocks through other markets by reigniting both inflation and economic demand fears simultaneously.For now, oil has reacted directionally as many would suspect, although the extent of its climb remains modest given the political stakes.U.S. crude hovered about $87 per barrel on Monday - marginally off highs hit late last week, still down some 8% from late September peaks, and little changed year-on-year.Yet the extent to which the backup in oil prices over recent months can impact wider economic sentiment was clear from the University of Michigan's household survey on Friday. It showed a drop in confidence this month alongside a sharp upward tilt in inflation expectations.But with U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar also tending to benefit from Middle East anxieties, the picture becomes messy and suggests a more general retreat from risky assets like stocks is still the playbook on any rise in geopolitical heat.As with prior influential political narratives, weekends tend to be nervy periods when markets are closed or illiquid and Fridays a time for battening down hatches just in case. That appeared to be the case last week as oil prices, gold, the dollar and Treasuries gained into the close while stocks fell back.Wall Street stock futures and 10-year Treasury yields were marginally higher into Monday's open, however, and the dollar and stock volatility gauges ebbed a touch.Story continuesThe tension barrels into a week that would otherwise be dominated by the third-quarter corporate earnings season, as a mix of banking behemoths and mega cap tech stocks report through the week.Shares in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup rose on Friday after their quarterly profits trounced analysts' estimates with help from higher interest rates.With Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley due out later this week alongside the likes of Tesla and Netflix, there's a lot to chew on.And it's a big week for Federal Reserve watchers, as Fed chair Jerome Powell and numerous other Fed officials make public appearances before their latest pre-meeting blackout starts from next week. U.S. retail, industrial and housing data dominate the economic release slate.Elsewhere, Poland's zloty and stocks rallied on Monday after the country's ruling nationalists appeared to have lost a parliamentary majority in the nation's most pivotal election in decades - opening the way for opposition parties to take power and signalling better relations with the rest of the European Union. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * New York Fed Oct manufacturing survey; Bank of Canada Q3 business outlook * Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker speaks * Eurogroup finance ministers meet in Luxembourg, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and ECB board member Fabio Panetta attending * U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

Economists are forecasting that annual growth dropped to under 5% in July-September from 6.3% in the previous quarter.A weaker Chinese economy is a drag on regional and global trade and manufacturing, slowing the global recovery from the pandemic.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was up 1% at 31,988.40 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.7% to 17,763.41.The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.3% to 3,081.75. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.5% to 7,059.00. India's Sensex advanced 0.5% and the SET in Thailand rose 0.5%.Markets appeared to have recovered, for the moment, even as Israel was preparing for a likely ground offensive into Gaza and fears deepened that the conflict could spread along Israel’s border with Lebanon.On Monday on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.1% for its best day since the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel by Hamas. It closed at 4,373.63. The Dow rose 0.9% to 33,984.54 and the Nasdaq composite added 1.2% to 13,567.98.“The risk-off tone that permeated markets a few days ago seems to be dissipating thanks to a lot of shuttle diplomacy by (U.S. Secretary of State Antony) Blinken and others in the region,” Robert Carnell and Nicholas Mapa of ING Economics said in a commentary. “However, all of this is before Israel mounts its ground offensive in Gaza, and that could turn sentiment rapidly sour again.”Oil prices have fallen back after a volatile week spurred by worries about disruptions to supplies from Iran because of the war.Early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was down 18 cents at $86.48 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday it fell $1.03 to settle at $86.66. It has been bouncing up and down since barreling from $70 during the summer to more than $90 late last month.Story continuesBrent crude, the international standard, gave up 3 cents to $89.62 per barrel. It fell $1.24 on Monday to $89.65 per barrel.Gold fell $6 to settle at $1,928.30 per ounce. Last week was its best in nearly seven months as worries climbed ahead of a possible invasion by Israel of northern Gaza.Treasury yields have jumped after tumbling last week on worries that fighting in Gaza will escalate. Early Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was 4.75%, up from 4.71% on Monday and from 4.62% late Friday.Financial markets have a history of weakening initially after a geopolitical shock, such as a war, only to reassert themselves and eventually move with corporate profits, economic growth and other long-term fundamentals, according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.“Investors should remember that markets are very resilient, have endured countless wars, recessions, and depressions, and have rewarded long-term investors with a well-crafted financial plan,” he said.More than 50 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report their earnings for the summer this week, including Bank of America, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Tesla, and investors are hoping for a better reporting season for corporate profits.Last week, several banks helped kick off the reporting season with better reports than feared.Charles Schwab rose 4.7% after it reported stronger profit for the three months through September than analysts expected.Shares of Lululemon jumped 10.3% in their first trading session after S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said the apparel company will join its widely tracked S&amp;P 500 index.

""He was thinking multiple steps ahead.""TEHRAN HIGH SCHOOLOil runs in the family's blood. Sheffield's father was an Atlantic Richfield Co executive who brought his family to Iran where Sheffield spent his high school years. He developed a fierce desire to win as quarterback on his Tehran school's American football team, said son Bryan Sheffield.""Scott is a huge competitor. That's what drives him. It's about being competitive with his peer group,"" said the younger Sheffield, one of five siblings and co-managing partner at investment firm Formentera Partners.After college, Sheffield worked for Amoco Corp and later joined his father-in-law's oil company and became CEO five years later. That company would become Pioneer Natural Resources.It grew from a small, $30 million family business in West Texas to one of the largest after combining with corporate raider Boone Pickens' Mesa Energy in 1997 and later discovering the shale oil hidden below its acreage.Story continuesSheffield retired two decades later but returned as CEO in 2019 after the company overspent and overpromised investors.On his return, he made Permian oil its sole focus: putting natural gas processing, oilfield services and South Texas shale assets on the block. Those generated about $1 billion in cash to buy rivals.He also embraced an emerging philosophy that emphasized shareholder returns over rapid production gains, rejecting a plan to more than quadruple Pioneer's oil production by 2026.""The big change is to treat capital just as important as production,"" he told investors in his first earnings report as resuming control of the company.Sheffield was unavailable to comment for this article.READING TEA LEAVESDaniel Yergin, an economic historian and author of ""The New Map,"" on the influence of U.S. shale on global markets, said Sheffield was a prescient reader of industry trends.""He picks up signals,"" said Yergin.Two of Sheffield's most significant insights were the major role technology would play in reshaping U.S. oil production and the recognition that big oil companies would eventually control the Permian, he said.In comments after the deal was disclosed, Sheffield and Exxon CEO Darren Woods said they agreed to terms of a sale two weeks after the pair first sat down to negotiate.Sheffield long espoused Pioneer and other shale firms needed ""size and scale"" to survive the next downturn as many oil companies have been wiped out over the years by OPEC price wars.He made the company more attractive by bulking up with purchases of DoublePoint Energy and his son's Parsley Energy for $11 billion combined as the COVID-19 oil crash slashed stock prices.The strategy of restraining production to boost shareholder returns has not sat well with those who believe it has diminished the U.S. role in oil markets.""I have been frustrated at the extent to which he's tried to suggest the U.S. oil and gas sector needed to embrace his unique brand of discipline across the board,"" said Doug Sheridan, managing director of research firm EnergyPoint Research.SALE WINNERSSheffield is one of the deal's biggest winners. He will receive a $29 million severance package, about $100 million in Exxon shares, and get a seat on Exxon's board after the sale concludes next year.His bluntness and reputation for a photographic memory may clash with Exxon's insular culture.""He's willing to stand up and say what he believes and willing to go talk to anyone on the global stage,"" said Bruce Vincent, former president of Swift Energy, who has known Sheffield for more than 30 years.Pioneer employees occasionally were hesitant to give him projections knowing Sheffield would remember them and question them later if the outcome did not match, said a former employee.He will have to rein in his outspokenness to remain on Exxon's tight-lipped board, said son Bryan.""I don't think he can be outspoken. That would be a no-no as a board member,"" he said.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; editing by Gary McWilliams and Marguerita Choy)]"

The expectation now is that they’ll help pick up the slack from industries like energy and health care that are still mired in an earnings slump.The five biggest companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — account for about a quarter of the benchmark’s market capitalization. Their earnings are projected to jump 34% from a year earlier on average, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.The S&amp;P 500 as a whole isn’t looking nearly as strong. The index’s profits are expected to be roughly flat, but they’d face a drop of around 5% without those five behemoths.“It’s very important for the big tech stocks to deliver” and bolster confidence broadly, said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management. “The Street expects earnings to be good across the board. Megacap tech stocks have whatever it takes to lead the market in the final quarter of the year.”Leading the MarketSoaring interest rates have rattled markets this month with the 10-year Treasury yield hitting the highest in more than a decade. A hotter-than-expected inflation report has investors bracing for the Federal Reserve to keep policy tight, and potentially hike again. That backdrop has reignited fears about a potential recession that have only been heightened by conflict in the Mideast.Story continuesTech stocks have faltered in the face of those headwinds, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbling for two straight months. But they’ve still hugely outperformed the overall market. The five key big-tech companies account for the bulk of the S&amp;P 500’s 13% advance this year.Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. are scheduled to kick off tech-related earnings Wednesday. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. report the following week. Apple announces Nov. 2 and Nvidia on Nov. 21.After robust second-quarter earnings, “we need to see more of the same in the third-quarter results,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. Given their big weighting, “you can bet that the rest of the market will play follow the leader as big tech earnings unfold this quarter.”He said he sees “fairly low odds of a tech earnings wreck this quarter.”Investors have good reason to be optimistic. In the past century, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied during reporting season about two-thirds of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Roadblocks AheadOne potential roadblock to an earnings-fueled rally is that a lot of the anticipated good news may be priced in. Alphabet and Amazon have gained more than 50% this year, while Apple and Microsoft have advanced nearly 40%.On top of rising profit expectations, the stocks have benefited from bets that the tech giants are best positioned to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. That’s despite Nvidia, whose shares have tripled this year, being the only one to show a substantial financial boost from the trend.A source of concern for investors is that even with recent declines, big tech’s stock-market valuations are still elevated. Apple and Microsoft are priced at about 27 and 29 times estimated earnings, respectively, well above averages over the past decade. That figure is around 18 for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.Expensive share prices put pressure on companies to deliver strong earnings, according to Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.“They have to constantly deliver or they will lose the attention of investors,” she said in an interview. “Somebody needs to keep buying, and these rich valuations need to be justified.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia has rallied more than 200% this year, boosted by the artificial intelligence frenzy that has gripped Wall Street. However, the stock is still far from the average analyst price target, suggesting that the brokers expect the stock to rise about 44% in the next 12 months.

We believe it will take at least a couple of quarters before it reaches some sort of a material number.”TCS, which has more than 100,000 generative AI-ready employees, is embedding the technology in several of its software offerings, a manoeuvre it says is helping win large deals.Krithivasan, who took over as CEO in June, has also revamped the company’s structure to better tap the business expertise of its senior executives and improve client connect.“We need to see whether it provides a sustained growth over a period of time,” Krithivasan said. “Does it remove the friction within the organization?”TCS and smaller rivals such as Infosys capitalized on the dot-com boom in the late 1990s to offer cheap backoffice operations to the world.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Productive States in the US.Productivity in the US: An AnalysisOn February 16, McKinsey reported that productivity in the United States has been growing at a rate of 1.4% on average, since 2005. However, achieving a long-term productivity growth of 2.2% annually has immense potential as it could add $10 trillion to the cumulative GDP over the next decade. Such a boost can even result in better workforce participation and an increase in average household incomes.The primary driving force behind the US economy is labor productivity which represents the economic output per hour worked. However, historical data indicates that labor productivity has declined over the years. Additional issues regarding workforce shortages have been on the rise. To combat this shortage, growth in labor productivity becomes essential since the number of non-workers in the country is going to increase relative to the number of workers, as the population ages.Productivity Disparity Among StatesWhile the US economy as a whole has experienced a productivity crisis, the productivity statistics in the states have been disparate. On June 15, the US Department of Commerce reported that in addition to the per capita local GDP, the average income across the US has been subject to a lot of variation. Bigger metropolitan areas have a higher median income as compared to smaller metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural areas in the country. The concentrated economic growth in larger metropolitans in the country backs up this variation.States with high productivity growth include Washington, California, New York,  North Dakota, Texas, Colorado, and Massachusetts. These states contribute to almost 40% of the national GDP and account for a significant number of jobs in the country. Strong sector growth in these states also impacts overall productivity to some extent. An example of this could be California which benefited from a dominant technology sector. Other sectors such as retail, accommodation, and transportation also drive state productivity. Hence, productive states achieve enhanced efficiency by offering an environment where companies in all sectors can grow sustainably. You can also take a look at the highest paying jobs in the US.Story continuesProductive US States: Home to MultinationalsStates with high productivity levels tend to attract a diverse set of companies. Washington being a highly productive state in the US, hosts many multinational companies. Some of these include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a widely used e-commerce platform in the United States. The company has been making efforts to leverage its strong position in the industry. On August 16, the company reported that it has extended its sponsored ads to websites and premium apps such as Pinterest, BuzzFeed, Hearst Newspapers, Raptive, Lifehacker, and Mashable. This will enable advertisers to showcase their products on these apps through the platform. This sponsored advertising will be automatically done by the platform whenever it is relevant to the customer. It will serve both the sellers as well as customers by easing the online shopping experience.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a popular coffeehouse chain, headquartered in Washington. The company spans across markets globally, increasing its global footprint with time. China has been one of the fastest growing international markets for the company. On September 19, the company reported the launch of its China Coffee Innovation Park (CIP), one of its largest investments in a manufacturing and distribution center outside America. This center has the capacity to supply to all existing Starbucks coffee locations in China. It is the first fully integrated mechanism which ranges from sourcing, blending and roasting to final distribution to company stores in China. The center is also energy efficient and highly sustainable.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates a chain of membership warehouses in countries including the US, China, France, Canada, Spain and many others. The company is based in Issaquah, Washington. The company’s warehouses offer a wide range of products such as appliances, groceries, automotive supplies, sporting goods, and office equipment. On September 26, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported strong earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $4.86, beating EPS estimates by $0.04. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $78.94 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year and ahead of revenue consensus by $978.21 million.Now that we have analyzed productivity trends across the US, let’s take a look at the 20 most productive states in the US.5 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility20 Most Productive States in the US Our Methodology:In order to compile a list of the 20 most productive states in the US, we started our research by choosing appropriate metrics to represent state-level productivity. The primary metric we selected was labor productivity. The rationale behind our primary metric was that labor productivity is a major driver of the US economy and also a significant indicator of economic growth in the long run. The labor productivity index was sourced from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data available for this metric was from 2022. Furthermore, we selected the per capita real GDP in every state as our secondary metric. Since this metric is the economic output in a state per person, it represents the economic performance of a US state. Hence, we used this measure to back our research up. This measure was sourced from the Institute for Policy &amp; Social Research at the University of Kansas. The per capita real GDP data was available from 2022.Finally, we ranked the 20 most productive states in the US on a priority basis, in order of their labor productivity and per capita real GDP, as of 2022.20 Most Productive States in the US20.

Per usual, I combed through the numbers along the left rail of the first page. Then, per usual, I focused on the box on the bottom right of the page for the latest commentary from its CEO Jamie Dimon.This comment from Dimon immediately popped out: ""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.""""Wow, that is pretty intense from Jamie,"" I said to myself. ""Never heard that tone from him before — what does it mean to the average investor?""With that comment right there from Dimon, the complexion of this earnings season has dramatically changed. The approach to investing in the market has changed into year-end, I think.One sentence by the most powerful CEO in the game today. And when he says something like that it warrants a new way of thinking by investors.Dimon followed up on this thread on the earnings call: ""My caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there, you just got to be very cautious."" He added he is concerned about government debt levels and inflation, two topics he has focused on in various venues in recent months.Story continuesYou may be asking yourself why, several days later, I am still harping on these comments.Here's why.The most powerful CEO in the world with the biggest network and the best information is using all of that to put forth guidance to his various stakeholders and followers. Dimon in no way takes making a statement like that lightly. He knows the gravity of his words.But then, in reality, Dimon is quite correct in his assessment.The Israel-Hamas war continues to play out on a grand stage worldwide, injecting fresh geopolitical uncertainties. The Ukraine-Russia war rages. All of this has ties back to China and resurfaces our contentious relationship with that country.The US House of Representatives is a flat-out mess that is making the country look bad again.‌There is still a chance of a mid-November government shutdown. Inflation is stubborn and rate hikes continue to permeate the economy. Government debt levels are crazy and getting crazier.Now if you follow the Warren Buffett style of investing, then none of this stuff matters. You buy stocks deemed attractively valued and shuffle along for the next 75 years drinking Coca-Cola.Not everyone subscribes to that approach, though, and many are trying to live for today by investing in the markets or other assets. To that end, it feels appropriate to have more caution on asset allocation in the near term until some of the aforementioned issues cool down. Besides, stock valuations aren't exactly cheap.‌It often pays to listen to smart people in investing, and Dimon is obviously one of the smartest people in the room.‌In case you were wondering, I got my charge-off answer.On JPM's media call, CFO Jeremy Barnum (another smart exec) told me he isn't seeing ""acute pain"" in consumers from higher interest rates. It was a fair response but I think one that suggests those retailers we follow here at Yahoo Finance will report tepid third quarter results.‌Hey, I am pretty smart, too.morning brief imageBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(NASDAQ:HOLX) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 13% in that time. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been respectable. After all, the stock has performed better than the market (67%) in that time, and is up 69%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Hologic There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, Hologic moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the Hologic share price is up 3.1% in the last three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 1.8% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 1.0% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Hologic's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Hologic's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveHologic provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 11% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Hologic better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Hologic , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: Hologic may not be the best stock to buy.

""The challenge of being labeled a utility is how a maturing company continues finding growth.""It could hike prices after the end of the Hollywood actors strike, a media report said earlier in October.Five months after calling a strike that plunged Hollywood into turmoil, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) last week approved a new contract with major studios.Netflix, however, has weathered the strike well thanks to its larger international presence and strong content slate.After a slow start for the ad plan launched last year, analysts said they expect Netflix will raise prices of its ad-free options in the coming months to nudge more subscribers to the other tier, where commercials help bring in more revenue per user.So far, most viewers subscribing to Netflix after the password crackdown have opted for the ad-free plans, analysts said. Its standard plan with ads costs $6.99 a month, while the ad-free plans start at $15.49.""Using these tactics, Netflix will likely double its ad-supported viewership next year,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Ross Benes. He expects Netflix to show more ads to users over time, catching up with rivals.The ad tier is expected to bring in some $188.1 million in revenue in the third quarter ended September, with subscriber additions of 2.8 million, according to Visible Alpha estimates.Story continuesOverall, Wall Street expects the streamer to post its strongest quarterly subscriber additions this year, according to LSEG data.Revenue in the third quarter likely rose 7.7% to $8.54 billion, the fastest growth in five quarters, thanks to strong programming that included the latest seasons of ""Sex Education"" and ""Virgin River"".(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru; Writing by Aditya Soni; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)]"

(NYSE:TJX) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.52bUS$3.76bUS$4.57bUS$4.59bUS$5.68bUS$6.21bUS$6.66bUS$7.04bUS$7.37bUS$7.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 9.38%Est @ 7.21%Est @ 5.69%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$152bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$152b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$75bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$113b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$88.6, the company appears about fair value at a 10% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For TJX Companies, there are three essential items you should further examine:Risks: You should be aware of the 1 warning sign for TJX Companies we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does TJX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

On October 13, 2023, Newmont and the Union submitted the Agreement to the Mexican Labor Court, which gave its approval, thus ending the strike.The strike was initiated by the Union demanding the Company pay additional profit sharing, equivalent to double the amount agreed upon one year ago, along with other alleged violations of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.""This unnecessary strike has caused significant hardship for all of our employees, contractors, host communities, suppliers and customers,"" said Tom Palmer, Newmont’s President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We will continue to honor our commitments, comply with the law and the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and work to protect the long-term value of Peñasquito.""Key terms of the Agreement include:Newmont will not pay any additional incremental profit sharing for 2022. This was the basis for the strike, and the profit sharing paid by the Company this year fully complied with Mexican law and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.If, as a consequence of the strike, the Peñasquito mine reports no profit in 2023, then Newmont agrees to pay an additional bonus in Q2 next year, equivalent to two months’ wages as the Company recognizes the hardship employees have experienced given the duration of the strike.Newmont will pay employees a fixed amount, roughly equivalent to 60% of wages lost, since the strike began on June 7, 2023. This payment is intended to mitigate the financial impact that the strike, initiated by the Union, has had on the Company’s workforce.Story continuesIn addition, as part of the separate, annual wage negotiations under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Newmont and the Union have agreed to an 8% wage increase, in line with Mexican mining industry wage increases for 2023. These wage negotiations were not part of the Union’s claims as grounds for taking the strike action.Newmont’s priority is to safely return the workforce to this Tier 1 operation while ensuring an orderly ramp-up in production. It is expected to take several weeks to achieve stable production levels and a status update will be provided during the Company’s Q3 earnings call on October 26, 2023.In 2022, Peñasquito contributed US$1.9 billion in economic value to Mexico, including US$643 million in employee wages and benefits, taxes, and royalty payments to federal, state, and local governments, and investments in community infrastructure and water projects. Minera Peñasquito is the second largest employer in Zacatecas, Mexico with a workforce of more than 5,000 individuals.

But inflation and dry weather conditions for sugar suppliers aren't dampening candy sales ahead of this year's Halloween festivities. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma explains the year-over-year projections for consumer candy spend.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- The latest inflation data is out. And it shows the price of sugar on the rise. But it isn't expected to put a damper on Halloween celebrations this year. Yahoo finance's Brooke Dipalma is here to tell us why. Brooke?BROOKE DIPALMA: Good afternoon, Josh. That's right, sugar and sweet prices jumped in the month of September. They were up 0.3% on a monthly basis, which then contributed to a year over year jump of up 6.5%. Now this comes as sugar futures were up 40% compared to a year ago, and prices are high and they ultimately are remaining high because of a lower global supply of sugar that we're seeing.Now extreme weather is to blame for that impact on global sugar supply. Countries that are major exporters like India, like Thailand, like Australia are suffering from what they say are really dry monsoon period. And ultimately that is impacting the amount in which they are producing.Now another contributor to these higher costs is cocoa futures, which one expert said is a bigger chunk of the total cost of manufacturing for candy producers than sugar is. But yet the good news here is that Americans are so eager to celebrate. More consumers are gearing up to celebrate this Halloween especially post pandemic. And they're tapping into nostalgia here as well, celebrating this. And higher prices also contributing to a record high of candy sales.This year $3.6 billion in candy sales are expected to hit a record high according to national retail federation. We also are expected to see 3/4 of Americans celebrate. That's up from last year. But one fun fact here is that nine out of 10 Americans are expected to wait and look for a good deal in the last two weeks of the holiday season. And Josh, Julie, I have to say that I have not done my Halloween shopping just yet. I am one of those people that is waiting for a good deal. And I can't wait to grab my favorite just Reese's coming out at hopefully-- you know, they're already on the shelves. They've been on the shelves I feel like since the middle of the summer. But I certainly will be grabbing for Reese's as well.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Wait Reese's the cups or the pieces? Very important.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good question. The cups. Always the cups.

Prices of other sweets rose nearly 3% compared to last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI).On a yearly basis, the overall sugar and sweets category rose 6.5%, including a 0.3% jump compared to the month prior.That's higher than overall food inflation, which increased 0.2% in September on a monthly basis and 3.7% year over year. The cost of groceries — food at home — jumped 0.1% and 2.4%, respectively.But fret not, trick-or-treaters. Consumers are expected to spend $3.6 billion dollars on candy this year, a nearly 14% jump from last year's total of $3.1 billion. That figure is an all-time high, according to the National Retail Federation. And nearly three-fourths of Americans, 73%, are expected to participate in Halloween festivities, higher than 69% last year.Extreme weather is driving prices higherSugar futures (SB=F) are up 40% compared to a year ago.""A lot of that increase that you're seeing is attributed to what the world's supply is going to look like,"" Andraia Torsiello, Mintec US sugar analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""India is actually a major exporter and they've had really poor weather conditions, so they're suffering from a really dry monsoon period.""It's partly the result of a climate pattern known as an El Niño over Asia, David Branch of Wells Fargo told Yahoo Finance over the phone: ""It's impacting India, Thailand, and Australia too.""As a result, ""India and Thailand did not get the monsoons they normally get,"" Branch said, which led to both governments basically shutting down exports.Last year, the growth rate of US sugar exports also dropped by 2.38%, per the USDA. Story continues""The reason why the prices are high and remain high is not only because of the inflation in the economy, but also just the supply not being as available as it was,"" Torsiello said.Another factor behind the rise: the cost of cocoa. Cocoa futures (CC=F) are up 46%.""There's a significant shortage of cocoa due to drought in those specific regions,"" Branch said, which spells bad news for candymakers. ""I imagine that's a bigger chunk of the total cost of manufacturing than sugar.""Halloween candy is for sale at a Harris Teeter grocery store last year. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)Despite the noise, companies and consumers are moving forward, ready to celebrate.A Hershey (HSY) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance there are no candy shortages related to the cost of sugar.""[Movements] in sugar, as far as total manufacturing cost, are really very minimal to the manufacturer,"" Branch said, when compared to the cost to produce, ship, and distribute the candy.On a call with investors following its Q2 results, Hershey CEO Michele Buck said the company expects a ""very strong Halloween,"" with planned marketing and an approach of ""leaning into Halloween.""It's also business as usual at Mars. ""We met all our commitments to retailers, and even ended up being able to exceed the amount of candy we committed to in some cases,"" a spokesperson said.Consumers are leaning in too. In Advantage Solution's recent survey around Halloween this year, 9 out of 10 respondents said they'll buy candy.""Folks are still ready to celebrate ... we're still spinning out of a pandemic, people are spending more time celebrating, even elongating seasons,"" Andy Keenan, Advantage Solutions executive vice president, told Yahoo Finance over the phone. ""There's a lot of nostalgia with Halloween.""Consumers will be looking for deals, though. Nine out of 10 shoppers will wait to make their purchase during the last two weeks of October.""[Consumers] know prices will come down ... very few folks are buying on Oct. 12. They're highly inclined to start shopping on Oct. 27,"" Keenan added.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

62,a25f21f5-2c9f-39a9-bc8f-dabfdb3d1620,GD,2023-10-16,Has General Dynamics Corporation's (NYSE:GD) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-corporations-nyse-gd-120013307.html,1697457613,STORY,['GD'],"[Most readers would already be aware that General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) stock increased significantly by 12% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Dynamics'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:17% = US$3.4b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.17 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 17% ROEAt first glance, General Dynamics seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that General Dynamics' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 6.1% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is GD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is General Dynamics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 41% (implying that the company keeps 59% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 36%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that General Dynamics' future ROE will be 20% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOverall, we feel that General Dynamics certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we will publish many (but not all) of the forecasts a few days afterward online. Here’s the latest…As winter nears, it looks like most heating fuels should be a bit cheaper at the start of the season than they were a year ago, when the supply issues resulting from Russia’s attack on Ukraine caused significant spikes in energy prices.Supplies of natural gas should be abundant when the weather turns cold, which is good news since roughly half of U.S. homes are heated with gas. Gas stockpiles are modestly higher than normal for this time of year. Autumn temperature outlooks suggest milder-than-normal weather across much of the country. If that comes to pass, gas supplies should build up further, helping to hold prices down for most consumers. On average, gas users paid about 17% less for natural gas in August than they did a year earlier.The story is similar for propane. With ample supplies in storage, a mild autumn would let those stocks build up further before they are drawn down during winter. Spot propane prices are down about 25% from this time a year ago, so retail users should see at least a bit of a break this fall, relative to the prices they paid last fall.Heating oil supplies aren’t so robust. Prices are down from a year ago. But, they’re on the rise, driven by a run-up in chemically similar diesel fuel. A cold winter and continued tightness in diesel supplies could cause a sizable jump in heating oil.This forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what’s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

Australia's Offshore Alliance union had called off strikes at Chevron's facilities last month after the union and Chevron accepted proposals from the country's industrial arbitrator, resolving a fight that threatened to disrupt around 6% of the world's LNG supply. Australia's Woodside Energy had also negotiated with workers in August and managed to avert strikes after reaching a deal. Here is a sequence of events leading up to the strike action: Date Development Aug. 9 Workers at Woodside's liquefied LNG facilities in Australia vote for industrial action. Aug. 10 Chevron and Woodside say they are holding talks with union to avert any potential action by the workers. Aug. 11 Australia's labor regulator, the Fair Work Commission, allows workers' union to hold a ballot of employees to decide if they wanted to make a decision on taking industrial action at Chevron's Gorgon and downstream Wheatstone LNG facilities. Aug. 15 Negotiations between Chevron, Woodside Energy Group and Australian unions continue but a source with knowledge of the matter tells Reuters that the talks are unlikely to yield results for days. Aug. 16 Woodside says ""positive progress"" was being made on talks with a union alliance on disputes over the wages of workers. Aug. 16 The Offshore Alliance says during the negotiations Woodside was ""well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration."" Aug. 18 Voting opens in Chevron's facilities to let workers decide if they want to strike due to disputes over wages and working conditions. Aug. 20 Unions at Woodside's North West Shelf offshore gas platforms announce plans to strike as early as Sept. 2. Aug. 22 Woodside CEO Meg O'Neil says the company has had ""constructively addressed"" several concerns of workers but said it also has a duty to shareholders to be able to run the business. Aug. 23 Woodside and unions meet for another round of talks to avoid the strikes. Aug. 23 Chevron's Australian unit says it would increase domestic gas production capacity at its Wheatstone facility. Aug. 24 Woodside reaches an in-principle agreement with unions to avert strikes. Aug. 24 Workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities vote to allow unions to call for a strike if necessary. Aug. 25 Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia warn that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions in exports if workers' demands on wages and conditions were not met. Aug. 28 Workers at Chevron's offshore Wheatstone facility grant unions the power to call strikes on their behalf. Aug. 28 Unions representing workers at Chevron's two major Australian LNG complexes say that they will take industrial action from Sept. 7. Aug. 29 Chevron's workers release details of industrial action including potential work stoppages of up to 10 hours. Sept. 1 Chevron workers reject a company pay and conditions offer. Sept. 1 The offshore alliance says no meetings have been scheduled between unions and Chevron. Sept. 4 Mediation talks to avert strikes at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia begin once again. Sept. 5 Chevron workers announce plans for total strikes from Sept. 14 if their demands were not met. Sept. 5 Some employees of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG facility in Australia offer to work during industrial action in a bid to avert domestic supply disruptions, the Offshore alliance says. Sept. 6 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities agree to pause planned strike action for one day until Sept. 8. Sept. 7 Chevron's LNG workers agree to delay the strike until 1 p.m. local time in Perth (0500 GMT) on Sept. 8 from the earlier scheduled start at 6 a.m. in Perth. Sept. 8 Workers at Chevron's LNG project begin strike as talks between the company and the unions fail to yield any results. Sept. 9 Chevron starts withdrawing contractor workers from Gorgon as the strike continues. Sept. 11 Chevron says it sees ""no reasonable prospect of agreement"" with the workers and would apply to the Fair Work Commission for an ""intractable bargaining"" declaration, which, if granted, would end the strike and allow the labor regulator to dictate an agreement. Sept. 12 The office of the labor regulator said it would hold a hearing on Sept. 22 about the dispute, while the unions wanted it to be held at a later date in November. Sept. 14 Union group Offshore Alliance said a turbine tripped at one of Wheatstone's two LNG trains, which convert natural gas into liquid, on the same day strikes escalated. Sept. 15 Workers begin a 24-hour strike at Chevron's LNG plants. Union representative says they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October. Sept. 18 Chevron says full production had resumed on Sept. 17 at its Wheatstone LNG plant after a fault last week cut production by almost a quarter. Sept. 20 Latest round of talks between Chevron and unions at its two LNG facilities in Western Australia ends without a deal. Sept. 21 Chevron says it would accept the terms of a deal brokered by the Fair Work Commission to end the dispute. Sept. 22 Australian union alliance calls off strikes at Chevron's two major LNG projects after accepting proposals from the country's industrial arbitrator to end long-running disputes over pay and conditions. Oct. 5 Workers vote to restart strikes accusing Chevron of reneging on commitments. Oct. 6 Night-shift workers at Chevron's facilities also vote for strikes. Oct. 9 Chevron asks the Fair Works Commission to help resolve the dispute again as unions announce Oct. 19 as the date for fresh strikes. Oct. 16 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities reaffirm their plan to resume strikes as mediated talks continue.

They were last trading at $89.65 a barrel.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, briefly rose to $87.98, compared with Friday’s closing price of $87.68. It was last trading at $86.50.Growing risk of escalationStill, investors are concerned the Israel-Hamas war could spark a wider conflict in the oil-rich region and further tighten global oil supply.Both futures had surged Friday, after Israel’s military warned more than 1 million people to leave northern Gaza, triggering worries about a potential ground offensive by Israel in retaliation for terror attacks by Hamas that killed at least 1,400 people.Speaking to CBS Sunday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that, while there was no new intelligence that the threat level from Iran had changed, “there is a risk of an escalation of this conflict.”Analysts at ANZ Research expect oil prices to hit $100 a barrel in the short term because of the growing risk of regional escalation.Neither Israel nor Gaza is a significant oil supplier, but the risk to oil markets will rise if “the conflict broadens,” they wrote in a research note Friday.“If [Iran] becomes involved, up to 20 million barrels per day of oil could be at risk of disruption directly and through obstructed logistics,” they added.The “Middle East risk” is dominating the landscape for global asset prices, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.Story continues“The ongoing conflict could weigh even further on the global oil supply over time by potentially reducing the probability of Saudi-Israeli normalization and posing downside risks to Iranian oil production, leading to a further surge in oil prices,” he said.Global oil prices had risen since late June as production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia fueled worries about reduced global supply. New US measures, unveiled last week, aimed at raising the cost of Russia’s attempts to skirt a cap on the price of its oil might have also driven oil prices higher.In currency markets, the shekel weakened Monday, hitting less than 4 per US dollar for the first time since 2015. The Israeli currency has tumbled close to 4% in the past 10 days.Israel’s central bank said last week that it planned to sell up to $30 billion of foreign exchange to stabilize the shekel after it fell sharply following the Hamas attacks.US stocks, meanwhile, closed higher on Monday as investors appeared to shrug off fears of growing geopolitical tension in the Middle East. The Dow closed 314 points, or 0.9%, higher; the S&amp;P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%.— Nicole Goodkind contributed to this story.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

He is seeking to win over investors with higher returns stemming from a “ruthless” focus on performance and financial discipline.The rally in Shell shares has been driven by higher commodity prices, particularly for natural gas in Europe, “and the strategic changes announced by the new CEO in June, which is likely drawing in more investors,” said Morningstar analyst Allen Good.However, Good points to “currency issues” as also being part of Shell’s rise. “US dollar-based shares remain below their highs, so part of the move is lower pound and euro.”(Updates with closing share price in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But Israel denied these, bombardment of the enclave resumed and the unfolding conflict continues to loom large over an otherwise packed events diary this week.For investors, crude oil continues to be most sensitive to the risk of widening regional war and most capable of emitting shocks through other markets by reigniting both inflation and economic demand fears simultaneously.For now, oil has reacted directionally as many would suspect, although the extent of its climb remains modest given the political stakes.U.S. crude hovered about $87 per barrel on Monday - marginally off highs hit late last week, still down some 8% from late September peaks, and little changed year-on-year.Yet the extent to which the backup in oil prices over recent months can impact wider economic sentiment was clear from the University of Michigan's household survey on Friday. It showed a drop in confidence this month alongside a sharp upward tilt in inflation expectations.But with U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar also tending to benefit from Middle East anxieties, the picture becomes messy and suggests a more general retreat from risky assets like stocks is still the playbook on any rise in geopolitical heat.As with prior influential political narratives, weekends tend to be nervy periods when markets are closed or illiquid and Fridays a time for battening down hatches just in case. That appeared to be the case last week as oil prices, gold, the dollar and Treasuries gained into the close while stocks fell back.Wall Street stock futures and 10-year Treasury yields were marginally higher into Monday's open, however, and the dollar and stock volatility gauges ebbed a touch.Story continuesThe tension barrels into a week that would otherwise be dominated by the third-quarter corporate earnings season, as a mix of banking behemoths and mega cap tech stocks report through the week.Shares in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup rose on Friday after their quarterly profits trounced analysts' estimates with help from higher interest rates.With Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley due out later this week alongside the likes of Tesla and Netflix, there's a lot to chew on.And it's a big week for Federal Reserve watchers, as Fed chair Jerome Powell and numerous other Fed officials make public appearances before their latest pre-meeting blackout starts from next week. U.S. retail, industrial and housing data dominate the economic release slate.Elsewhere, Poland's zloty and stocks rallied on Monday after the country's ruling nationalists appeared to have lost a parliamentary majority in the nation's most pivotal election in decades - opening the way for opposition parties to take power and signalling better relations with the rest of the European Union. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * New York Fed Oct manufacturing survey; Bank of Canada Q3 business outlook * Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker speaks * Eurogroup finance ministers meet in Luxembourg, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and ECB board member Fabio Panetta attending * U.S. Treasury auctions 3-, 6-month bills(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

In Britain, the day-ahead contract fell by 10.00 pence to 128.00 p/therm.""Looking at the fundamentals on the Continent, we see an overall weaker demand side than last Friday. Our LDZ (local distribution zone) consumption forecasts have adjusted significantly lower with the heating demand forecast being now mostly below normal,"" LSEG analyst Ulrich Weber said in a morning note.North-west Europe is experiencing lower temperatures that could last through the weekend. The rest of October and the beginning of November are forecast to be warmer.""The cold temperatures can be felt and frost was seen this morning which is expected to pass by the end of the week and seasonal normal temperatures will be maintained for the foreseeable future,"" consultancy Auxilione said.Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia reaffirmed their plan to resume strikes this week as mediated talks continued on Monday.Supply fears have grown as Israel instructed operator Chevron to halt natural gas exports through a major subsea pipeline between Israel and Egypt.Damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline has also raised fears over the security of Europe's energy infrastructure sites after the Finnish Prime Minister said it could have been done deliberately.Although European storage inventories are at record levels and gas demand is 15-20% below levels before the war in Ukraine, the European gas market remains tight into 2024-25 until the next wave of supply hits the market in 2025-26, according to consultancy Timera Energy.In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract fell by 1.86 euros to 84.09 euros a tonne.

One time-tested strategy is to invest in high-quality dividend-paying stocks. Companies that consistently raise their dividends can provide much-needed income and downside protection when markets get choppy. Even better, reinvesting those dividends over the long-run can compound returns, and help investors achieve their financial goals.With valuations looking more reasonable after the market’s recent pullback, now could be an opportune time to rotate into these dividend payers. With the market potentially bottoming, investors can lock in higher yields before these stocks bounce back. Though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, these seven dividend stocks have been stalwarts through prior downturns, given their solid fundamentals.Energy Transfer (ET)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Energy Transfer (ET) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWith the disruption in energy markets due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. energy companies like Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) stand to benefit. Natural gas prices have surged globally, with disproportionate pressure on U.S. and Middle Eastern supply. Additionally, despite economic headwinds, oil prices have proven resilient thanks to production cuts from OPEC. Even if the war ended today, sanctions would likely remain, so I believe energy prices aren’t likely to decline anytime soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn particular, Energy Transfer’s natural gas pipelines and export facilities connect fast-growing supply basins like the Permian and Haynesville to demand centers along the Gulf Coast. With global competition for U.S. natural gas exports heating up, Energy Transfer’s infrastructure offers reliable takeaway capacity. For example, the recently-completed Gulf Run pipeline provides Haynesville gas an outlet to LNG export terminals. Meanwhile, Energy Transfer’s NGL pipelines and fractionators allow it to handle record volumes. Notably, the company’s Nederland export terminal exported over 30 million barrels of ethane in the first half of 2023 alone.Story continuesOn the crude oil front, the company’s acquisition of Lotus Midstream continues to pay dividends via commercial synergies. The partnership exported record amounts of crude in July 2023, utilizing Energy Transfer’s footprint. Looking ahead, Energy Transfer anticipates its capital run rate to average $2-3 billion annually over the long-term. Currently, the company’s cash flows support a targeted 3-5% annual distribution growth. The distribution was recently increased to $1.24 per unit annualized. ET stock now yields 9.2% annually.AT&amp;T (T)a picture of cell towers during daytimeSource: ShutterstockAfter some missteps in content and media investments, telecom giant AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) appears to be back on track with its core connectivity offerings. Following its spinoff of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T has refocused on its wireless and fiber broadband businesses. Impressively, the company has added 8.3 million valuable postpaid phone subscribers over the past three years, closing the gap on industry leaders. AT&amp;T has also doubled its fiber broadband revenues since mid-2020, reflecting strong demand for its premium fiber service.At the same time the company is reducing its debt load and cost profile, AT&amp;T continues investing at record levels in both its 5G and fiber offerings. Its wireless network now provides 5G service to more than 290 million customers, including 175 million with speedy mid-band spectrum. These network upgrades support new services like fixed wireless internet access for rural areas. With consumers and businesses increasingly dependent on connectivity, AT&amp;T’s investments position it for sustainable growth.Meanwhile, T stock offers an attractive 7.7% dividend yield. With a simplified operating focus and progress on deleveraging, AT&amp;T appears poised to maintain its dividend streak. While past investors endured missteps in content, today’s investors can buy a focused telecom leader at an opportune valuation. AT&amp;T still has work ahead to improve its margins, but its essential communications services and renewed discipline make it a compelling turnaround story.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAs a major U.S. midstream company, Enterprise Products Partners stands to benefit from tight energy supply and demand. Events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underscore the essential nature of North American oil and gas. Enterprise Products‘ (NYSE:EPD) diversified footprint handles over 11.9 million barrels of liquids, and processes nearly billions of cubic feet of natural gas per day. Critically, its infrastructure connects fast-growing basins like the Permian to Gulf Coast refineries, petrochemical plants, and export facilities.With energy exports surging, Enterprise is rapidly expanding its footprint. For example, natural gas pipelines like Acadian now transport Haynesville gas to LNG terminals, while NGL exports out of Enterprise’s Marcus Hook terminal keep setting records. Meanwhile, new fractionators and pipeline capacity will support growing Permian production. These expansions utilize existing infrastructure to capture new opportunities.Underpinned by strong volumes and stable fees, Enterprise generates steady cash flow to support its distribution. The company has now delivered 26 consecutive years of distribution growth. The latest hike takes EPD stock’s yield to 7.4%. Accordingly, with a strong balance sheet and $4 billion liquidity, Enterprise appears poised to continue growing its distribution in a volatile energy market. Its integrated infrastructure remains critical for providing the link between supply and demand across North America.Hess Midstream (HESM)Pipelines in the desertSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.comMany energy stocks sport eye-popping dividends, but midstream operator Hess Midstream (NYSE:HESM) pursues a unique strategy – aggressive share buybacks. Since 2021, Hess Midstream has repurchased 18% of its stock, reducing its unit count and increasing its dividend per share by 33%. This combination of buybacks and growing payouts has delivered a standout total return. Hess Midstream’s leverage of 3.1-times the company’s EBITDA also remains comfortably below peers, enabling ongoing buybacks.Hess believes another 10-15% of shares can be repurchased through 2025, financed through forecasted cash flow growth. The company anticipates 10%+ annual EBITDA and cash flow growth based on accelerating Bakken shale output. Hess Midstream provides essential gathering, processing, terminal, and water services across the Bakken, underpinning its projected growth.With its parent expanding Bakken drilling, Hess Midstream’s gas processing volumes already rose 6% year-over-year in Q2 2023. Looking ahead, Hess forecasts its Bakken output will grow 10% annually through 2025. This outlook provides clear visibility into Hess Midstream’s projected double-digit cash flow growth. While Hess Midstream lacks a jaw-dropping dividend, its balanced approach of buybacks and payout hikes continues generating outsized total returns. The company’s dividend currently yields 8.45%.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comDuring the pandemic, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) saw its top- and bottom-lines surge as e-commerce and logistics demand exploded. And in my opinion, while the pandemic boom has faded, this global logistics leader still has plenty of runway for growth. The company put up solid Q2 results despite economic turbulence. Revenue declined 11% year-over-year, but 5.5% top-line growth and double-digit EPS growth is expected next year.Meanwhile, the company’s operating profit edged down too, but I expect it to recover as UPS adjusts its cost profile. Agility is key in uncertain times. Personally, I believe UPS boasts an unmatched integrated network, spanning domestic small packages, freight, logistics, and international. Who doesn’t love UPS?Though near-term consumer spending may fluctuate, UPS targets growing areas like healthcare logistics. The company is on track to generate $10 billion in healthcare revenue this year. UPS ia also expanding its Digital Access Program, which simplifies shipping for e-commerce platforms. In my view, UPS has the scale, infrastructure, and innovation to deliver growth for years to come.Additionally, UPS continues directing lots of cash to shareholders. The company returned $4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2023 through dividends and buybacks. The company now targets revenue at about $14 billion in 2023, supported by robust cash generation. The stock also pays a well-covered 4.2% dividend yield.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is the largest public North American railroad pure-play, providing integral infrastructure connecting farms, factories, ports, and more. I believe railroads like UNP receive too little fanfare, despite their indispensable role in our economy.In Q2, Union Pacific’s volumes fell 2% year-over-year amidst consumer spending shifts. Ongoing service improvements allowed Union Pacific to meet available demand, though margins faced pressure. Still, Union Pacific has returned more than $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of 2023. Notably, this cash cow has also hiked its dividend annually for 16 straight years, with UNP stock currently yielding 2.5%. While pandemic-era margins may moderate, I have high hopes for the stock over the long-run.In my view, Union Pacific offers investors a premier rail pure-play backed by strong dividend growth. Infrastructure investments and service improvements aim to drive efficiency, fluidity, and volume growth over time. Union Pacific’s wide moat business model should continue rewarding shareholders for decades to come.Tyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has faced turbulence recently, with profits squeezed by inflation, higher costs, and moderating demand. The stock now trades more than 45% below its 2021 highs. However, I believe much of the macro negativity is priced in at current levels. Plus, TSN stock still offers income investors an impressive 4% dividend yield.In Q3, Tyson’s chicken segment remained pressured by low commodity pricing and higher feed costs. However, Tyson is optimizing its footprint by closing six chicken plants this year, plus transitioning its antibiotic-free chicken brand to “no antibiotics ever.” In beef and pork, tight cattle and hog supply have weighed on spreads. However, Tyson’s prepared foods segment continues gaining shelf space and market share through beloved brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park.I’m putting this stock at the bottom of this list due to mixed feelings displayed by Wall Street analysts. However, I am very bullish on TSN stock over the long-run. Gurufocus’ model tags the stock’s fair value at nearly $90 per share.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

75,d041dbee-89dd-37ad-8bb6-2554b9d86c5b,MA,2023-10-16,15 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-powerful-militaries-africa-092609934.html,1697448369,STORY,"['LMT', 'LHX']","[In this article, we look at the 15 most powerful militaries in Africa, their defense spending and where their military equipment comes from. You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa.Global military spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to figures released in April this year by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), of which $39.4 billion was spent by African countries – dropping 5.5% compared to the previous year. Nearly half of this military expenditure was incurred in North Africa, primarily in the Western Sahara region due to the conflict between Morocco and Algeria that has been ongoing since 1975.Ethiopia, in East Africa, has also witnessed an 88% increase in its defense related expenditure since 2020 after the launch of an armed offensive against Tigray rebels. On the other hand, Egypt continues to remain a heavy spender and a military might in the region, in line with President Sisi’s vision for Egypt to have a global posture as a powerful state. The Arab Spring in the early 2010s and terrorism in the Sinai peninsula have also ensured that the Egyptian state raises a strong military force.Russia is the largest arms exporter to Africa, particularly in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. According to a report, Russia’s military exports to Africa increased 23% between 2016-2020 compared to 2011-2015. Putin’s government has for a long period focused on the continent to foster strong ties with African governments, facilitate economic opportunity, and build presence on NATO’s southern flank.That being said, recent sanctions placed on Russia by the West have impeded several countries from trading with Moscow, and that has created a boon for Chinese armament manufacturers. A publication by the Atlantic Council citing SIPRI reported that between 2017 and 2020, China exported three times as many arms to Sub-Saharan Africa than the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, China’s arms exports to the region totaled $2.04 billion, which were only second to Russia’s export volume of $2.24 billion. In contrast, the United States only exported arms worth $473 million during that time period.Story continuesThings are different, however, when it comes to North Africa, with American armament manufacturers playing an active role in the arms race between Morocco and Algeria, as well as Egypt’s quest to be a major regional power. Earlier this year in April, the US government approved the potential sale of HIMARS artillery rocket systems and related equipment to Morocco for a deal worth $524 million. The primary contractors of HIMARS deal will include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) among others.In addition to this, the Pentagon also gave the green signal for the sale of Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco at a cost of $250 million, for which the primary contractor will be RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Morocco has also been scrambling to secure Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet to enhance its aerial capabilities vis-à-vis Algeria which recently upgraded its air force with the acquisition of Russian combat jets like the Su-30 and MiG-29 and signed an agreement in 2020 to buy 14 Russian SU57 stealth fighters. Rabat is hopeful that its strong relations with Israel, which has seen Tel Aviv recognising Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, will help secure a deal with the US for the F-35 fighter jets. The Moroccan air force already has an active fleet of 15 F-16 fighter jets. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Egypt has also been looking to strengthen its defense systems with American air radars. The US government in January 2022, approved the sale of three SPS-48 land-based radars to be produced by L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) at a cost of $355 million. The radars offer excellent jamming immunity and are capable of detecting even extremely small targets. A year earlier in February 2021, it was reported that the US sold Egypt Rolling Airframe Missiles made by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for a deal valued at $197 million.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most powerful militaries in Africa using a variety of key metrics covering ground forces, air force, and naval capabilities. Moreover, we have also weighed in factors that are often overlooked, such as GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels of countries, all three of which are critical for military success. Only a strong economy is able to raise and sustain a potent military force. On the other hand technological advancement coupled with defense spending often give a key edge to certain militaries over others.Therefore, we have assigned 40% weightage to GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels in our analysis. while the remaining 60% is made up of militaries’ strengths in manpower, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, aircrafts including fighter jets, and naval fleet.We listed countries based on how well they rank on each individual metric and then applied these weights in our calculations to get an average ranking score for each country. The 15 most powerful militaries in Africa are ranked in descending order of these average ranking scores.Data to generate this list has been sourced from Yahoo’s recent articles, 50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa. We also consulted Insider Monkey’s recent piece, 15 Countries that have the Best Economy in Africa, Global Firepower Index 2023, Flight International 2023, and Global Innovation Index 2022.15 Most Powerful Militaries in AfricaLMspencer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most powerful militaries in Africa.15.

Much of the country’s military strength is derived from its aerial fleet, which also includes 3 F-6 and 11 F-7 combat aircrafts. Tanzania also has several home-grown small ammunition factories, which supply weapons to the Tanzanian military.13.

Despite having a large army, the country spends less than 1% of its GDP on defense. Congo is among the 20 Countries with Highest Rate of Economic Growth in 5 Years, and can certainly look to leverage its economic potential to upgrade its military.11.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa.Global military spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to figures released in April this year by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), of which $39.4 billion was spent by African countries – dropping 5.5% compared to the previous year. Nearly half of this military expenditure was incurred in North Africa, primarily in the Western Sahara region due to the conflict between Morocco and Algeria that has been ongoing since 1975.Ethiopia, in East Africa, has also witnessed an 88% increase in its defense related expenditure since 2020 after the launch of an armed offensive against Tigray rebels. On the other hand, Egypt continues to remain a heavy spender and a military might in the region, in line with President Sisi’s vision for Egypt to have a global posture as a powerful state. The Arab Spring in the early 2010s and terrorism in the Sinai peninsula have also ensured that the Egyptian state raises a strong military force.Russia is the largest arms exporter to Africa, particularly in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. According to a report, Russia’s military exports to Africa increased 23% between 2016-2020 compared to 2011-2015. Putin’s government has for a long period focused on the continent to foster strong ties with African governments, facilitate economic opportunity, and build presence on NATO’s southern flank.That being said, recent sanctions placed on Russia by the West have impeded several countries from trading with Moscow, and that has created a boon for Chinese armament manufacturers. A publication by the Atlantic Council citing SIPRI reported that between 2017 and 2020, China exported three times as many arms to Sub-Saharan Africa than the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, China’s arms exports to the region totaled $2.04 billion, which were only second to Russia’s export volume of $2.24 billion. In contrast, the United States only exported arms worth $473 million during that time period.Story continuesThings are different, however, when it comes to North Africa, with American armament manufacturers playing an active role in the arms race between Morocco and Algeria, as well as Egypt’s quest to be a major regional power. Earlier this year in April, the US government approved the potential sale of HIMARS artillery rocket systems and related equipment to Morocco for a deal worth $524 million. The primary contractors of HIMARS deal will include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) among others.In addition to this, the Pentagon also gave the green signal for the sale of Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco at a cost of $250 million, for which the primary contractor will be RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Morocco has also been scrambling to secure Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet to enhance its aerial capabilities vis-à-vis Algeria which recently upgraded its air force with the acquisition of Russian combat jets like the Su-30 and MiG-29 and signed an agreement in 2020 to buy 14 Russian SU57 stealth fighters. Rabat is hopeful that its strong relations with Israel, which has seen Tel Aviv recognising Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, will help secure a deal with the US for the F-35 fighter jets. The Moroccan air force already has an active fleet of 15 F-16 fighter jets. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Egypt has also been looking to strengthen its defense systems with American air radars. The US government in January 2022, approved the sale of three SPS-48 land-based radars to be produced by L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) at a cost of $355 million. The radars offer excellent jamming immunity and are capable of detecting even extremely small targets. A year earlier in February 2021, it was reported that the US sold Egypt Rolling Airframe Missiles made by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for a deal valued at $197 million.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most powerful militaries in Africa using a variety of key metrics covering ground forces, air force, and naval capabilities. Moreover, we have also weighed in factors that are often overlooked, such as GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels of countries, all three of which are critical for military success. Only a strong economy is able to raise and sustain a potent military force. On the other hand technological advancement coupled with defense spending often give a key edge to certain militaries over others.Therefore, we have assigned 40% weightage to GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels in our analysis. while the remaining 60% is made up of militaries’ strengths in manpower, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, aircrafts including fighter jets, and naval fleet.We listed countries based on how well they rank on each individual metric and then applied these weights in our calculations to get an average ranking score for each country. The 15 most powerful militaries in Africa are ranked in descending order of these average ranking scores.Data to generate this list has been sourced from Yahoo’s recent articles, 50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa. We also consulted Insider Monkey’s recent piece, 15 Countries that have the Best Economy in Africa, Global Firepower Index 2023, Flight International 2023, and Global Innovation Index 2022.15 Most Powerful Militaries in AfricaLMspencer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most powerful militaries in Africa.15.

At a median follow up time of 46.7 months, KEYTRUDA demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 24% (HR=0.76 [95% CI, 0.64-0.91]). At an earlier prespecified interim analysis, with a median follow-up of 32.4 months, KEYTRUDA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS in the overall population (HR=0.76 [95% CI, 0.63-0.91]; p=0.0014) compared to placebo in patients with NSCLC who are at high risk of recurrence (stage IB [T2a ≥4 centimeters]), II or IIIA by American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition (AJCC 7th edition).""In the unfortunate scenario that non-small cell lung cancer recurs after surgery, most patients have to face limited palliative treatment strategies, underscoring the need to improve treatment outcomes for earlier stages of NSCLC,"" said Dr. Solange Peters, chair of the medical oncology and thoracic malignancies department, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. ""This approval of KEYTRUDA marks the first immunotherapy option approved in the EU for patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are at high risk of disease recurrence following surgery and chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression.""Story continuesThis approval allows marketing of this KEYTRUDA regimen in all 27 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland.""Today’s approval demonstrates our continued progress to help more patients living with certain types of lung cancer in Europe, treating them earlier in their disease when it may be the most impactful,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are proud that in Europe, KEYTRUDA now has five approved indications in non-small cell lung cancer, in both earlier and advanced stages of disease.""About KEYNOTE-091The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-091, also known as EORTC-1416-LCG/ETOP-8-15 – PEARLS, a randomized, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02504372) sponsored by Merck and conducted in collaboration with European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP). The study evaluated KEYTRUDA compared to placebo for the adjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC who are at high risk (stage IB [T2a ≥ 4 centimeters], II or IIIA by AJCC 7th edition) of recurrence following complete resection, regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status, who may or may not have received adjuvant chemotherapy as recommended by their physician. The dual primary endpoints were DFS in the overall population and in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%). Disease-free survival is calculated as the time from randomization to the date of disease recurrence, occurrence of second primary lung cancer, occurrence of second malignancy or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.An additional efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS). Overall survival results were not mature, with only 58% of pre-specified OS events in the overall population.The study randomized 1,177 patients (1:1) to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] for one year or maximum 18 doses; n=590); or placebo (IV Q3W for one year or maximum 18 doses; n=587). The median number of doses was 17 for KEYTRUDA and 18 for placebo.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In recent decades, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer increased from 11% to 15% on average across EU countries. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

(TDI), a business unit within Kratos Unmanned Systems Division, and Boeing [NYSE: BA] for the TDI-J85 turbine engine to provide propulsion for the Powered Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).Boeing’s Powered JDAM combines a 500-pound ordnance, the conventional JDAM guidance kit, with a wing kit and a Kratos TDI-J85 engine to deliver high-end range at an affordable price. The cost savings is in part due to the low-cost turbine engine technology developed and enhanced by TDI over four decades. Powered JDAM will provide low-cost stand-off capability against land and maritime threats. Leveraging the JDAM family of weapons, it is designed to be produced at scale, exportable to any of the 35 JDAM partner nations, at a cost-point that enables affordable mass.“We are proud that Boeing has selected our TDI-J85 engine for the Powered JDAM system. Incredible potential exists for this long-range, precision strike capability,” said Joseph Kovasity, Senior Vice President for TDI. “At Kratos TDI, we have been singularly focused on producing small, low-cost, military-grade turbine engines at quantity in the United States with U.S. suppliers and partners. With the Kratos acquisition of TDI, we have substantially invested in manufacturability for production scale resulting in an incredibly high engine performance-to-cost ratio, while ensuring we can meet the large quantity deliveries predicted for the Powered JDAM system and program.”“Powered JDAM is the next step in the modular evolution of the JDAM and JDAM Extended Range family of weapons systems. Its ability to complement exquisite weapons system with low-cost stand-off capability will add new weapons capacity to the U.S. defense industrial base to support the current fight and deter future fights,” said Bob Ciesla, Vice President of Boeing Precision Engagement Systems.Story continuesThe TDI-J85 straightforward architecture is capable of producing 200-lbf of net thrust at Sea-Level Static conditions. Specific Powered JDAM requirements are met with design adjustments achieving the desired thrust output at design point.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global sporting and athletic goods market, you can go directly to 5 Best US Cities for Athletes.The US ranks high among the countries that produce the best athletes in the world. Cities around the country offer a wide variety of athletic facilities, play places, and other strong attractions for athletes. However, some cities in the US are better equipped than others.Before we talk about the 20 best US cities for athletes, let’s take a look at the sporting and athletic goods market and what some of the key players are up to.The Sporting and Athletic Goods Market: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global sporting and athletic goods market size was valued at $179.1 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $238.89 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The growing popularity of national and international sporting tournaments and leagues is attracting a strong following worldwide. This has led to a surge in the number of people participating in sports at various levels, which is a key driving factor for the increase in demand for sports and athletic goods. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of people are now looking for ways to create customized workout routines in the comfort of their own homes. The growing trend of home fitness is fueling the demand for sporting and fitness products, which is further augmenting market growth. Additionally, health and wellness trends, celebrity endorsements, and the increasing influence of social media platforms are all driving growth in the global sports goods market.Key Market PlayersThe sporting and athletic goods market is highly competitive and consists of regional and international competitors. Some of the biggest companies in the market are NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU).Story continuesLululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) is a multinational athletic apparel retailer and one of the best sporting goods stocks to buy. On September 27, the company announced a five-year strategic global partnership with Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON). Through this partnership deal, Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) will become the exclusive digital fitness content provider for Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) while also making Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON). This partnership will expand brand awareness and reach for both companies as the two brands collaborate on technical athletic apparel, real-world experiences, and original content to engage with their global community of members in the US, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom.Some of the companies in this space are also offering loyalty programs. By offering rewards and benefits to loyal customers, sporting goods companies encourage them to keep buying their products and engaging with their business. This helps increase sales and profitability while also allowing the sporting and athletic goods companies to build stronger relationships with their customers.On August 1, Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA) announced that US based consumers that are 16 years or older can now enroll and start earning points with Under Armour Inc.’s (NYSE:UA) “UA Rewards” loyalty program. Users can earn points through purchases, product reviews, and UA MapMyRun Challenges. This is the company’s first ever loyalty program, which will allow consumers to connect more deeply with the brand in new and rewarding ways. President and CEO of Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA) Stephanie Linnartz said:“UA Rewards is a diverse program offering value to consumers, including celebrity athlete experiences and exclusive wellness content.”Some of the companies are investing heavily in research and development to create new and innovative products. On July 26, Forbes reported that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has unveiled the new ReactX foam in their InfinityRN 4 running shoes. Developing a new foam that is both high-performing and sustainable was not an easy task according to senior product director Bret Schoolmeester, but NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has succeeded after five years of research and development. Made using an injection molding process instead of a compression molding process, the ReactX foam offers a 13% increase in energy return to the runner. Energy return is a key goal for any performance foam. Like everyone else, athletes lose energy with every step, which makes it harder to keep going. A foam that returns energy to the runner can help athletes achieve faster times or simply feel better during their workouts.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is one of the top sports companies that are delivering strong financials in 2023. On September 28, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024.

That number also accounts for delayed commercialization of the product, which was pushed to January 2024 from the company's previous expectation of commercialization in the second half of this year. Pfizer is also lowering its 2023 revenue expectations for Comirnaty by approximately $2 billion due to lower-than-expected vaccination rates.Pfizer Inc. now foresees 2023 revenue in a range of $58 billion to $61 billion, down from its prior forecast for $67 billion to $70 billion. It now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $1.45 and $1.65 per share due to lower-than-anticipated revenue for COVID-19-related products and inventory write-offs.That is short of the full-year revenue of $63.61 billion and earnings of $2.77 per share that Wall Street was expecting, and far short of the company's previous projections of per-share earning between $3.25 and $3.45.JPMorgan said the company's update solves an ongoing U.S. Paxlovid inventory debate and it anticipates the company's bigger-than-expected cuts to its sales projections will help put a floor under per-share earnings expectations for next year.]"

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 36% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 7.2% in the last year.In light of the stock dropping 5.5% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Waters While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Waters achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 78% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Waters' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Waters had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.2%, against a market gain of about 21%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Waters better, we need to consider many other factors.

Talks have yet to start with Stellantis, which has the largest Canadian manufacturing footprint of Detroit's three automakers.The GM agreement came after a brief strike last week by the workers at GM factories in Oshawa and St. Catharines, Ontario, and a parts warehouse in Woodstock, Ontario.GM says in a statement that the deal recognizes worker contributions while positioning the company to be competitive in the future.Unifor said that the deal includes pay raises of nearly 20% for production workers and 25% for skilled trades. Workers would get 10% in general pay raises in the first year, with 2% in the second and 3% in the third. The company also agreed to restore cost-of-living pay raises starting in December of 2024.

Never miss another opportunity to secure an edge for your portfolio.Tesla reaches battery production milestoneEV giant Tesla (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:TSLA) celebrated a significant production milestone Wednesday, announcing on X (formerly Twitter) the creation of its 20 millionth 4680 battery cell at its Texas Gigafactory.In just four months, Tesla has effectively doubled its 4680 battery cell production, having previously disclosed reaching 10 million cells by the end of the summer. These high-performance cells, designed to enhance vehicle range, power, and durability, were unveiled during Tesla's Battery Day in 2020.While some Model Y vehicles have utilized these cells, they might be reserved for the upcoming Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Tesla is challenging a $230 million legal fee claim by shareholder lawyers related to a dispute over director compensation.Tesla calls this an ""unwarranted windfall"" and has sought approval for a fee not exceeding $64M. CEO Elon Musk's separate $56 billion compensation was not part of this lawsuit.In July 2020, the dispute was settled, with directors agreeing to reimburse Tesla $735M in a $919M deal. Shareholder lawyers are seeking 25% of this settlement, which Tesla argues is inflated and doesn't reflect the company's actual benefit from the deal, estimated at $295M.The main discrepancy arises from stock options, valued at $458M, but Tesla clarified that these options couldn't be exercised, highlighting a more modest advantage of approximately $20M due to reversing accounting costs. Elon Musk is not involved in this settlement.Shares of TSLA ended the week down 1.6% to $251.12 after reaching a weekly high of $268.38 on Tuesday.Story continuesOSHA concerns plague GM and LGIn the wake of growing concerns about workplace safety, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has recommended imposing hefty fines of $270,000 on an Ohio joint venture battery plant operated by General Motors (NYSE:GM) and LG Energy Solution (KS:373220).OSHA's recommendation comes following the discovery of several violations, including inadequate safety training and failure to comply with federal guidelines for personal protective equipment usage. The JV, called Ultium Cells, has been instructed to adhere to OSHA's directives, including installation of mandatory machine guarding and implementation of comprehensive worker training programs for hazardous energy control and emergency response procedures.In response to OSHA's recommendation, Ultium Cells released a statement affirming its commitment to prioritizing workplace safety. The company has requested a hearing with OSHA, indicating its willingness to engage in dialogue to address these issues.Further complicating matters, OSHA has been conducting an ongoing inspection at the Ultium facility, prompted by a fire incident in June. The agency has also launched three separate inquiries, one related to workers' exposure to chemicals due to a pressure gauge failure in August, which resulted in the leakage of battery slurry onto the plant floor.Shares of GM ended the week down 3.1% to $29.66 after reaching a weekly high of $31.94 on Wednesday.VinFast boosts position with VinES acquisitionVietnamese EV maker VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) has strategically enhanced its position by acquiring a 99.8% stake in battery maker VinES.This move is expected to ensure a stable battery supply for VinFast's EVs despite initial increases in expenses.The acquisition aims to optimize operating costs and elevate the technological capabilities of VinFast's EV offerings, with an anticipated 5%-7% reduction in battery expenses.Additionally, VinES's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, has committed to covering all interest payments tied to VinES's current borrowings until 2027, demonstrating strong support for VinFast's electric vehicle ventures.Shares of VFS reached a weekly high of $8.24 on Friday before closing the week Friday with a price of $7.98.Related ArticlesTesla hits major battery-production milestone: This week in EVsSouth Korea to fine two Hong Kong banks for naked short-sellingUAW says had to escalate action on Ford]"

(NYSE:PNC) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript October 13, 2023The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $3.6, expectations were $3.21.Bryan Gill: Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. I am Bryan Gill, the Director of Investor Relations for PNC. And participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak, and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 13, 2023, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.Bill Demchak: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on the slide, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, generating $1.6 billion in net income, or $3.60 in diluted earnings per share. Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment, but I'd like to touch on a few highlights. First, in a challenging operating environment, we generated 3 points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management. Our credit quality remained strong during the quarter, reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk, customer selection, and long-term relationship development, all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles. Next, we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter.An investor confidently discussing portfolio options with their asset manager. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9Story continuesWhile we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas, based on our current estimates, we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate. We continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, including our expansion market efforts in upgrading our digital capabilities. And we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the Signature Bank loans that we recently acquired. Finally, we are focused on expense management, particularly in the current environment, and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control. We increased our Continuous Improvement goal last quarter from $400 million to $450 million, and we are on track to achieve that goal in 2023.Looking ahead, we expect to have CIP savings within a similar range for 2024. And as a reminder, we used savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology. In addition, earlier this month, we began executing on staff reductions, which will reduce our 2024 expenses by $325 million and will fall to the bottom-line. All told, we are implementing more than $725 million of expense management actions that will have impact on 2024. While decisions involving personnel are never easy, we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders, and we'll continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.Rob Reilly: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on Slide 3 and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter. Loans were down 2% and averaged $320 billion. Investment securities declined $1 billion or 1%. Cash balances at the Federal Reserve increased $7 billion to $38 billion. Deposits of $423 billion declined $3 billion or 1%. Borrowed funds increased $2 billion, primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter. At quarter-end, AOCI was a negative $10.3 billion compared to a negative $9.5 billion at June 30, reflecting higher interest rates. However, tangible book value increased to $78.16 per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of AOCI.Common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately $600 million. And we remain well capitalized with an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30, 2023, which increased 30 basis points linked quarter. Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Third quarter loans averaged $320 billion and increased $6.5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Compared to the second quarter, average loan balances declined 2% as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial. Consumer loans grew approximately $500 million, reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances. Commercial loans averaged $218 billion, a decline of $5.5 billion, driven by lower utilization as well as paydowns outpacing new production.Loan yields increased 18 basis points to 5.75% in the third quarter, predominantly driven by the higher rate environment. Slide 5 covers our deposits in more detail. Average deposits decreased $3 billion, or 1%, due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits. In regard to mix, consolidated noninterest-bearing deposits were 26% in the third quarter, down slightly from 27% in the second quarter, and consistent with our expectations. And we still expect the noninterest-bearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid-20% range. Commercial noninterest-bearing deposits represented 42% of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to 45% in the second quarter. And our consumer deposit noninterest-bearing mix remains stable at 10%.Our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.26% during the third quarter, up from 1.96% in the prior quarter. And as of September 30, our cumulative deposit beta was 41%, which was slightly better than our July expectation. Slide 6 details our investment security and swap portfolios. Average investment securities of $140 billion decreased $1 billion, or 1%, as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. The securities portfolio yield increased 5 basis points to 2.57%, reflecting new purchase yields of 5.5% and the runoff of lower-yielding securities. As of September 30, the duration of investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years. Our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled $35 billion on September 30.The weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased 34 basis points to 2.07% and the duration of the portfolio was 2.4 years as of September 30. Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately $800 million in the third quarter as a negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter. Importantly, as lower rate securities and swaps roll off, we expect our securities yield to continue to increase, resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from AOCI accretion. Turning to the income statement on Slide 7. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue grew 5% compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates and business growth. Noninterest expense grew 2% and was well controlled despite a higher FDIC assessment rate and inflationary pressures.As a result, we generated 3% positive operating leverage, and PPNR grew 9%. For the third quarter, net income was $1.6 billion, or $3.60 per share. Total revenue of $5.2 billion decreased $60 million, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income declined $92 million, or 3%. And our net interest margin was 2.71%, a decline of 8 basis points. Noninterest income increased $32 million, or 2%, as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Third quarter expenses decreased $127 million, or 4% linked quarter. Provision was $129 million in the third quarter. And our effective tax rate was 15.5%, which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.Turning to Slide 8, we highlight our revenue trends. Third quarter revenue was down $60 million, or 1%, compared with the second quarter. Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million or 3%, as higher yields on interest earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Fee income was $1.7 billion and increased $67 million or 4% linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue, which was up $103 million, the majority of which, or $97 million, was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting this, capital markets and advisory revenue decreased $45 million, or 21%, driven by lower trading revenue. M&amp;A advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines.Going forward, we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter, which is included in our guidance that I will cover in a few minutes. Other noninterest income of $94 million declined $35 million linked quarter, driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative Visa fair value adjustments totaling $51 million. As a reminder, at September 30, PNC owned 3.5 million Visa Class B shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately $1.3 billion. Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter expenses were down $127 million or 4% linked quarter, which in part reflected our increased CIP program. And we generated 3% positive operating leverage on both the year-to-date and the linked-quarter basis. Importantly, every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of 2023.Our credit metrics are presented on Slide 10. While overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio, the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize. Non-performing loans increased $210 million, or 11%, linked quarter. The increase was driven by multi-tenant office, CRE, which increased $373 million, but was partially offset by a decline of $163 million in non-CRE NPLs. In regard to the CRE office portfolio, total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at 23%. The difference this quarter is the migration of certain multi-tenant office loans to NPL status, which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio.Ultimately, we expect future losses on this portfolio, and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly. As of September 30, our reserves on the office portfolio were 8.5% of total office loans and, inside of that, 12.5% on the multi-tenant portfolio. Naturally, we'll continue to monitor and review our assumptions, especially in the higher rate environment, to ensure they reflect the real-time market conditions. And a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides. Total delinquencies of $1.3 billion increased $75 million, or 6% linked quarter, driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies. Net loan charge-offs of $121 million declined $73 million, or 38% linked quarter. Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans ratio was 15 basis points in the third quarter.And our allowance for credit losses totaled $5.4 billion or 1.7% of total loans on September 30, essentially stable with June 30. Turning to Slide 11. From a capital perspective, we're well positioned with a CET1 ratio of 9.8% as of September 30. This slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels, assuming the Basel III Endgame proposed rules were effective as of September 30. The inclusion of AOCI reduces our ratio by approximately 190 basis points. And the impact of all other proposed Basel III Endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative 40 to 50 basis point impact to our CET1. Taken together, the current Basel III Endgame proposal would increase our risk-weighted assets by approximately 3% to 4%. And our estimated fully phased-in expanded risk-based CET1 ratio would be approximately 7.4%, which is above our current requirement of 7%.In light of the fluidity of the capital proposals, our share repurchase activity remains on pause. We'll continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors. In regard to the long-term debt proposal, if the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter, our binding constraint would be the long-term debt to risk-weighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level. We estimate our current shortfall at the holding company and the bank to be approximately $1 billion and $8 billion, respectively. And we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan, as well as the restructuring of existing inter-company debt.We acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change. That being said, we're well positioned to comply with the proposals as drafted. Slide 12 provides more detail on the $16 billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from Signature Bridge Bank earlier this month. PNC has been active in the capital commitment business for many years. We believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry. Signature's origination strategy was similar to PNC's, which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers. As such, we expect to retain 75% of the portfolio. This acquisition is financially attractive given the purchase price of 99% of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio.Importantly, the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share. Slide 13 details our focus on controlling expenses. As Bill mentioned, we remain diligent in our expense management efforts, particularly when considering the current revenue environment. Our Continuous Improvement Program has been in place for over a decade, and through this program we've utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments. Over the past 10 years, through CIP, we've identified and completed actions to reinvest $3.7 billion in our company. As you know, we have a 2023 CIP target of $450 million, and we're on track to meet that target. Looking to 2024, even though we've just begun our budgeting process, we do expect a 2024 annual CIP goal of similar magnitude to the 2023 program.Our CIP efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low single digit annual expense growth. However, the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual CIP program. As a result, we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reductions, which we began implementing earlier this month. This initiative will decrease the workforce by 4% and is expected to reduce 2024 expenses by approximately $325 million. One-time costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $150 million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe these actions will position PNC for stronger efficiency going forward.As a result, even though our budgeting cycle isn't complete, we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in 2024, which by definition would exclude the fourth quarter one-time charges. In summary, PNC reported a solid third quarter 2023. In regard to our view of the overall economy, we're expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024, with a contraction in real GDP of less than 1%. We expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between 5.25% and 5.5% through mid-2024 when we expect the Fed to begin cutting rates. Looking ahead, our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is as follows. We expect average loans to be up approximately 3%, including the acquisition of the Signature Bank capital commitment facilities.Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%. Fee income to be up approximately 1% as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated MSR hedge gains during the third quarter. Other noninterest income to be in the range of $150 million and $200 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect total core non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4%, which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction. Additionally, this guidance does not contemplate the pending FDIC special assessment, which could occur during the fourth quarter. And we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.See also 10 Best States to Start an LLC and 13 Stocks to Buy with Exponential Growth.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.John Pancari: Good morning.Bill Demchak: Hey, John. Good morning.John Pancari: On the -- just regarding the office increase in non-performers that you discussed a bit, can you just give us a little bit more detail? Is that more indicative of -- did you see an acceleration in the deterioration of these credits that were noteworthy in the quarter and that necessitated the move to non-accrual? Or was this more of a function of an ongoing scrub of your portfolio as you're re-evaluating collateral values or whatnot behind properties? And as you do that as well, can you maybe talk about some of the value depreciation you're beginning to see on some properties that have traded? Thanks.Bill Demchak: I guess what I would say is what you're seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit. So, our criticized list didn't really move. We moved inside of that loans to non-performing. By the way, I think they're actually all still accruing. We just kind of get there because we don't think they're re-financeable in the current market. The move to non-performing from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly. So, I don't -- I mean, none of this is a surprise. We have heavy reserves against it. We kind of saw it coming. It's the big bulk of these properties moving through the [indiscernible]...Rob Reilly: Just the migration of the past. We do expect losses, as I said in my comments, but we believe that we're appropriately reserved.Bill Demchak: There's no -- it's not like there's some new scrubbing, John. I mean, we've been -- we're live on every one of these properties every day. So, it's not like we opened a drawer and found something. We know exactly what each of these are...John Pancari: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then separately on the expense side, can you really help us think about how the $325 million you expect to fall out of the bottom-line from the headcount rationalization, how that would impact the growth rate that you expect overall for expenses in 2024 versus 2023? How should we think about that growth?Rob Reilly: Yeah. So, I mentioned in my opening comments when we walk down both the CIP that we anticipate implementing in '24, along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep '24 expenses stable year-over-year. We haven't completed our budget process. In fact, we're at the beginning of our budget process. So, we don't have a lot of '24 guidance for you other than that is our objective and that will be our expectation.Bill Demchak: John, the other thing, the reason we kind of put the Continuous Improvement in there is, it's a number that we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company. So, that's sort of what's been driving our investment game for the last bunch of years, that continues. What's new is basically dropping the run rate related to personnel and just tightening the ship and what is it a tougher revenue environment.John Pancari: Got it. I'm sorry, if I could ask just one more. On the Signature acquisition -- of the Signature loans that is, the $0.10 of accretion that you mentioned on that, can you maybe walk us through the components of that? How do you arrive at that amount?Rob Reilly: Oh, sure. That's basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased. They are short-term, about a year. So, we do expect that $0.10 a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into '24. But when we get to '24, of course, we'll include that in our full year guidance.John Pancari: Got it. Okay, thanks, Rob.Rob Reilly: Sure.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Nate Stein: Hey, guys. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one quick follow-up on the expense program. We talked about the $725 million total cost actions. So, outside of the workplace reduction, can you just talk about the -- just the other areas of efficiencies you're investing in? Thanks.Bill Demchak: I mean, the workforce reduction is a specific number we mentioned of the $325 million inside of Continuous Improvement, which we do every year. We're focused on contract renewals, on management [indiscernible], building occupancy efficiencies, all the things you'd expect us to be focused on in the ordinary course of running the business.Rob Reilly: And that's a program that we've had in place, as I mentioned, for several years, and allows us to -- and has allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low single-digit range, even with all those investments. And in point of fact, this year, we're pointing to 1% growth year-over-year '23 over '22, and a large part of that is because of our Continuous Improvement Program.Nate Stein: Great, thanks. And then if I could just ask you a follow-up question on the capital markets fees. So, they came in weaker than expected this quarter. You talked about, I think, stable versus the last quarter. One of your larger peers reported stronger capital markets this morning. Can you just talk about the driver of this? Was it mostly mixed related? And then maybe touch on the outlook near-term, given the macro outlook is better than a few months ago? Thanks.Bill Demchak: I didn't -- I'm not sure what anybody else reported. My guess was that the trading line item was better than peer fees. But in our case, the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from Harris Williams or Solebury or syndications and so forth. And while the pipelines remain robust, if not at record levels, the activity level, while there's been some green shoots, just hasn't been strong. Eventually it flows through. But we're getting a little tired of predicting when it will be.Rob Reilly: But I would add to that, our capital market is weighted towards our M&amp;A advisory Harris Williams. We had a soft second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our pipelines were higher than the first quarter. So, we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher, but it wasn't. So, we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter with even higher pipelines than we had at the beginning of the quarter. But inside of that, a subset of the pipeline are signed deals, which that part is higher than it was at this point last quarter. So, we do expect to see the lift, and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels.Nate Stein: Thank you.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Scott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call.Rob Reilly: Hey, Scott.Scott Siefers: I wanted to ask sort of a broad question -- hey, kind of a broad question on NII. Are we getting to a point where that will start to trough? So, maybe Rob, just sort of some of the puts and takes. It seems like your deposit betas are coming in as expected or better. I know there should be some asset repricing as we look into next year, but some of the larger banks have been sort of vocal about the degree to which they're still over earning on NII, which I think is kind of kept these fears of still bleeding out NII alive sort of industry-wide. Maybe just some thoughts on how you see things playing out for PNC in particular.Bill Demchak: I'll start.Rob Reilly: Okay.Bill Demchak: All of it ends up being dependent on what you think the Fed is going to do. Personally, I think the Fed is higher for longer, even higher for longer than the market expects. In our official forecast, I guess we have two cuts towards the back half of next year. As short rates stay higher, you will continue to see betas creep up, both because we're going to reprice the back book and secondly because you'll just not on betas but just on the shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. So, when that inflection point is -- has in some ways to do the most with what's going on with the yield curve in the Fed, as the curve continues to flatten by the long-end selling off, all else equal, that helps, notwithstanding the marks on our existing bonds, it helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment.There's too many variables in there, but the basic notion that we're -- at the inflection point, I think, is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year. And we haven't done our budget yet, so we're not going to call it.Rob Reilly: Yeah. I would just add to that, just observations. Deposits continue to decline. We expected that, but that decline is slowing. Betas have gone up, but the increase has slowed. In fact, in the third quarter, the actuals came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly. So things have slowed as far as that trajectory is, and then obviously the inflection point issues that Bill just covered are valid.Scott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe a question on credit as well. I guess just in the last few weeks, there's been a couple commercial hiccups in the industry in the shared national credit space. Just was hoping you might be able to remind us about PNC's exposure in this next space, and then just generalization sort of how that portfolio quality compares to the rest of the book, how much you lead, et cetera?Rob Reilly: Yeah, pretty good there, Scott, in terms of credit. So, all of the noise, so to speak, is in the commercial real estate office space that we spoke about. As far as the shared national credit results went, they're complete. They're represented in our numbers. And it was pretty benign in terms of total deals. Upgrades were more than downgrades, but they were a handful of each.Scott Siefers: All right. Thank you very much.Rob Reilly: Sure.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.Gerard Cassidy: You guys gave us good color on the burn-off of the securities portfolio. And the question I had is, it looked like this quarter you put more up at the Fed. So, what are you guys doing with the cash flows from the portfolio now in terms of where you're putting it in other securities? And then, second, once the Basel III Endgame is finalized, how do you think you guys will approach in carrying your securities? Will you carry less than available for sale or more? Can you share with us your thoughts there as well?Bill Demchak: I guess just with the existing book, it's running down. We've run down the DV01 in our securities and swaps through the course of the entire year. We've had some purchases, but not to the extent we've had maturities. And we've been buying, I don't know what average yield is, but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it in the Fed. Going forward, the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesn't really affect anything. It's an accounting entry. So, we'll keep some amount unavailable for sale to the extent we trade around that book, but we don't trade around that book all that much, and the rest will just buy into held to maturity, which is, by the way, what we've been doing thus far since rates have gone up.Rob Reilly: There's a couple things to add there. One of the uses of cash, Gerard, was the purchase of the Signature loans. So that was our biggest...Bill Demchak: Yeah, that was biggest...Rob Reilly: Yeah, that was our biggest outlay. And then on the [split] (ph). Bill has it right. Where we are now is probably about where we are plus or minus to your views in terms of what -- but where we got to holding it all to 100% of AFS was the tailoring, which has passed us. So, we're back to sort of the normal [split] (ph).Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, you just mentioned about the purchase of the Signature loans. You guys are in a good position that you're not being impacted by Basel III Endgame, RWA, inflation like some of the big money centers, of course. Do you think there's going to be opportunities for you guys to buy other portfolios, not from the FDIC per se, but from some of your peers or banks that do mitigation strategies to get to these RWA targets they need to get to?Bill Demchak: Yeah, I suppose there could be. I don't know that we've actually seen any. We get pitched by everybody to execute one, which we have no need for.Rob Reilly: Right.Bill Demchak: But the purchase side of that is actually pretty attractive. They're giving away a lot of economics. So, it's actually a good thought. I'll go look around.Rob Reilly: No, we have the capital flexibility to do it, and people know our telephone number.Gerard Cassidy: Yeah. And then specifically, it would be more in the C&amp;I space or consumer? Or do you guys have a preference should they call that phone number, Rob?Bill Demchak: It's -- look, we're intelligent -- hopefully, intelligent takers of risk at the right price.Gerard Cassidy: Got it.Bill Demchak: We can evaluate what's out there.Gerard Cassidy: Very good. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.Bryan Gill: Next question, please.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Bill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning. Bill and Rob, I wanted to follow up on your office CRE comments. How much of an impact to debt service coverage are P&amp;C customers experiencing from swaps that are rolling off, say in cases where they issued floating rate debt under SERP two to three years ago, and put on swaps to lock in low fixed rates at the time but are now facing a significant reset as those swaps mature? I'm just curious if how significant that maturing swap dynamic is inside of the portfolio and whether you feel like you have a good handle on that dynamic?Bill Demchak: I don't know the answer to that. I would tell you, though, the bulk of our stuff, and you see it in our maturity schedules, we're kind of stabilization loans-ish project loans. And so in that instance, the hedge dynamics of somebody would put on that loan, in my experience, would be less than what they would have done on a term, 10-year CNBS alternative. So, my guess is it's not -- I think they're just in trouble for floating rate loans from lease rates going down, from vacancies going up, and from the rehab costs of redoing floors for...Rob Reilly: Capital improvements.Bill Demchak: Yeah. Just dropping the value of the buildings.Bill Carcache: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could follow up on that, if refinancing loans at current market rates would cause debt service coverage ratios to fall below 1, can you discuss how much leeway there is inside of P&amp;C to refinance loans under potentially more favorable terms to allow debt service coverage ratios to remain satisfactory? And then maybe just more broadly across the industry, do you think so-called extend and pretend dynamics could become pervasive, particularly since banks have made it clear they don't want to own office buildings and we've seen some commentary from regulators sort of urging banks to work with their customers?Bill Demchak: I think the extend part is possible. I think the pretend part, that doesn't work.Rob Reilly: Not so good.Bill Demchak: Yeah. We work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because that's ultimately going to maximize the value of our loan. In some instances that means taking the building and selling it. In some instances that means getting more equity capital, extending a loan at a debt service coverage ratio we normally wouldn't under the theory that they can lease it up itself. But each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on what's the net present value of what we PNC can get against our loan. In any event, if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan, that shows up in our reserves or charge-offs or so on and so forth. There's no pretend involved.Bill Carcache: Understood. That's very helpful, Bill. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one last one on the point about whether we're at an inflection point on deposit betas sort of depending on the Fed. Does it [correlate that] (ph) suggest that we could see terminal beta expectations potentially drift higher relative to prior guidance, again, depending on how much higher for longer persists?Bill Demchak: Yeah, I think. And by the way, this isn't a forecast. I think it's just common sense, right? To the extent that we still have a back book of business as does everybody that hasn't necessarily repriced, and if rates are pinned at 5% forever in time, that beta will continue to go up. It's a function of how high does the Fed go and how long do they stay there. And everybody's been wrong so far. So, yeah, it's a possibility.Bill Carcache: Understood. I wanted to ask you another one about the CFPB sort of open banking proposal bill, but I'll queue back up for that one. Thank you.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Troisi with Barclays. Please go ahead.Peter Troisi: Hi. Thanks very much for the disclosure on the long-term debt shortfalls in the slides. You talked about $10 billion of debt issuance annually, but do you anticipate needing to issue more than $10 billion to close the shortfalls that you disclosed in the slides? Or can the $8 billion shortfall at the bank be met just by restructuring existing internal debt? And I guess the question really is, do you expect to issue debt at the holding company specifically to invest in the internal debt of the bank?Rob Reilly: Yeah. This is Rob. So, good question. So, in regard to the long-term debt, our message is, independent of the rules, as we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits that was pre-COVID, we would be compliant. So that's the takeaway. In regard to how we get there, it's a combination of everything that you outlined. There will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan that will then ultimately be papered down to the bank, but there's a lot of moving parts there. The message is we'll get there and we would have gotten there independent of these rules.Peter Troisi: Okay. Thank you.Rob Reilly: Sure.Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Bill Carcache: Yeah, thanks for taking my follow-up. So, Bill, I was hoping you could just share your thoughts on the CFPB's plans to propose an open banking rule. There's a view that open banking essentially forces the industry to hand over the keys to the customer relationship. You've talked in the past about sort of the dynamic of like passwords and all that kind of stuff, but I was just hoping you could speak broadly to that point or that topic.Bill Demchak: Yeah, I think, what I've seen thus far out of CFPB commentary is they're largely focused on some of the right things. Make it easier for customers, agree with that. Secure data, agree with that. Don't allow data to be sold and commercialized without customer permission, agree with that. Make customers agree to specific data items that they want to share in a secure environment. So, all of that stuff versus where we are today where it's a free for all and there's a lot of fraud, actually I'm in favor of. The notion of kind of open banking where somehow I can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another because now there's technology to do it, I'm not that afraid of that. It's more in the technology to allow it in a secure manner, dependent of what rule is written, doesn't exist today.And I kind of look at what they're doing and hope it's a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information, leading to a reduction in fraud across the industry. And the sound bites are, that's where they're going.Bill Carcache: Okay, that's helpful. I had heard something along the lines of some of the actions they're taking are intended to make it easier for customers to ""break up with their banks."" And so, I was wondering if there was anything in the language. You mentioned how you're not worried about the ability to shift the relationship...Bill Demchak: Look, at the end of the day -- by the way, if that happened, terrific. We compete every day and we have good customer service and great products, we'll be a net beneficiary. Practically, the technology to allow that to happen, so just think about the notion of, okay, now you have connected APIs that allow somebody to gather information and move information. Now you need to build a program that keeps track of the back book while you open a new book on a checking account, transfers, balances on cards and all. So, eventually somebody will come up with a cool business model that might be able to do that on the back of laws that allow it on the back of APIs that haven't been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks in question together. But that hasn't happened yet.Bill Carcache: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Bill Demchak: Hey, Mike.Mike Mayo: Sorry about that earlier. So, in terms of the decline in commercial loans, how much of that decline is due to softer demand and how much of that is deliberate as you look to shore up capital more than you previously would have intended?Bill Demchak: Well, none of it's deliberate per se. We've seen some drop in utilization. We've seen a drop in kind of refinance rate as people are -- think about a corporate loan revolver where it's a three-year and every two years you renew it for the next three years. Everybody's kind of extending out under the hope that things are going to get better on spreads. So, there's just been less activity. At the margin, we are extending less credit into credit-only new relationships on the hope that we're going to get fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get cross-sell. But that's kind of at the margin thing.Bill Demchak: Yeah, that's small. It's on the demand side.Mike Mayo: Okay. And you're very clear about the expense guidance and the tough actions you're taking with personnel. Did you give an outlook for operating leverage over next year? Do you think the pace of expense decline will be faster than any decline in revenues? And specifically to the fourth quarter, the SBNY loan acquisition, looks like it adds a couple percent to your fourth quarter NII, but you're guiding down 1% to 2%. So that decline might be a little bit more than some had expected. It's more than you had expected. The quarter decline looks like 2% to 4% in the fourth quarter. Is that math correct? Why is it down maybe more than you thought? And the big question, though, is revenues versus expenses over the next year?Rob Reilly: Bill, do you want me to? I can. Well, on the expense issue, we did say that we expect '24 expenses to be stable. And we haven't finished our budgeting cycle, so we can't really answer in terms of anything beyond that in '24. In regard to the NII and the fourth quarter guide, it does include the Signature acquisition, which we said was about $0.10 a share. Recall, in the third quarter, we had expected 3% to 5% decline. We ended up down 3%. So, when we look to the fourth quarter, roll all that together, that's how we get down 1% to 2%.Mike Mayo: Got it. Okay, thank you.Rob Reilly: Sure.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up on the Signature acquisition as well. So just wondering if you can provide a little more context on the portfolio, seeing the line that you're expecting to hold on to -- or expecting to hold on to 75% of the relationships over time, are you bringing on new team members? Is there expenses along with that? And just anything you can help us in terms of like the duration of the loans and is there just kind of a natural run-off that happens given I think that they're generally a pretty short duration type of loan? Thanks.Bill Demchak: Yeah. It's de minimis adds of people that we're bringing on. We're already in the business. We have the technology to be in the business. We know the clients. The rundown, we're kind of saying, 75% probably survives. Most of that is simply a function of where we have overlap with clients and the size hold that we want to have for a particular client, we'd syndicate more of it as we kind of right-size our hold. There may be inside of that book of business a handful of people that we would choose not to renew, but their credit quality is pristine. We know we underwrote every fund that is in that. And through time, you would expect that as they mature, we'll renew and some period of time out a couple of years, we'll end up with 75% of the notional that we started with, and you'll have no clue between now and then how much it was.Rob Reilly: But that's right. De minimis expense is involved with it, and we're excited about it.Ken Usdin: Yeah, that's a fair point on we won't know. That's what I was trying to ask. The second question is...Bill Demchak: But to be clear, I mean, it'll be lost inside of our book of business.Rob Reilly: It becomes part of our...Bill Demchak: It becomes part of our C&amp;I balances.Ken Usdin: Completely understood. The second question I had, Bill, is you mentioned in a higher longer for environment, we got to see what the Fed does in terms of where deposit betas and mix goes. On the asset side, however, though, can you help us understand what happens in terms of fixed rate loan repricing versus -- and how much you might still have left in that versus obviously when we get to a peak in Fed funds, we'll know that the variable rates have -- will have gotten there?Bill Demchak: Yeah. So we have, I mean, beyond our securities book and swaps, which obviously we will reprice over the next several years, we have, I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, percentage of our loan book, either fixed rate to begin with, think of an auto loan, or with swaps on top of it, floating rate loan, we swap to fix, and those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book and there's a lot of dry powder there that we'll reprice. We are back to this notion that, hey, we're out there competing and growing this company, we will be originating those loans as they reprice. We're not dumping assets and getting out of things. It's going to shrink the total volume that's on our book.Ken Usdin: Yeah. No, I totally understand. I would think it would be a net positive as an offset to whatever has happened.Bill Demchak: You have the competing parts, right? We're going to have repricings of fixed rate assets fighting reprices of our liabilities. At some point, that's going to cross, and banks are going to grow NII at high percentages. I just can't tell you when that is yet, and we haven't done our budget next year.Ken Usdin: Yeah, that's fair. Okay. Thank you.Operator: And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.Bryan Gill: Okay. Well, thank you...Bill Demchak: Thanks, everybody.Bryan Gill: Yeah. Thanks for participating. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thanks.Rob Reilly: Thank you.Operator: That does conclude the conference call for today, and we do thank you for your participation.]"

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-110035444.html,1697454035.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) has had a rough three months with its share price down 23%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.3% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's decent 8.1% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 8.1% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Intuitive Surgical fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Intuitive Surgical's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Analog Devices'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:10% = US$3.8b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, Analog Devices seems to have a decent ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 15% does temper our expectations. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 21% net income growth reported by Analog Devices over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Analog Devices Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Analog Devices' significant three-year median payout ratio of 67% (where it is retaining only 33% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.Additionally, Analog Devices has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 13%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Analog Devices has some positive aspects to its business. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely achieved by the company reinvesting its earnings at a decent rate of return. Still, its earnings retention is quite low, so we wonder if the company's growth could be higher, were it to pay out less dividends and retain more of its profits? With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa.Global military spending was estimated to be $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to figures released in April this year by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), of which $39.4 billion was spent by African countries – dropping 5.5% compared to the previous year. Nearly half of this military expenditure was incurred in North Africa, primarily in the Western Sahara region due to the conflict between Morocco and Algeria that has been ongoing since 1975.Ethiopia, in East Africa, has also witnessed an 88% increase in its defense related expenditure since 2020 after the launch of an armed offensive against Tigray rebels. On the other hand, Egypt continues to remain a heavy spender and a military might in the region, in line with President Sisi’s vision for Egypt to have a global posture as a powerful state. The Arab Spring in the early 2010s and terrorism in the Sinai peninsula have also ensured that the Egyptian state raises a strong military force.Russia is the largest arms exporter to Africa, particularly in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. According to a report, Russia’s military exports to Africa increased 23% between 2016-2020 compared to 2011-2015. Putin’s government has for a long period focused on the continent to foster strong ties with African governments, facilitate economic opportunity, and build presence on NATO’s southern flank.That being said, recent sanctions placed on Russia by the West have impeded several countries from trading with Moscow, and that has created a boon for Chinese armament manufacturers. A publication by the Atlantic Council citing SIPRI reported that between 2017 and 2020, China exported three times as many arms to Sub-Saharan Africa than the United States. Between 2010 and 2021, China’s arms exports to the region totaled $2.04 billion, which were only second to Russia’s export volume of $2.24 billion. In contrast, the United States only exported arms worth $473 million during that time period.Story continuesThings are different, however, when it comes to North Africa, with American armament manufacturers playing an active role in the arms race between Morocco and Algeria, as well as Egypt’s quest to be a major regional power. Earlier this year in April, the US government approved the potential sale of HIMARS artillery rocket systems and related equipment to Morocco for a deal worth $524 million. The primary contractors of HIMARS deal will include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) among others.In addition to this, the Pentagon also gave the green signal for the sale of Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco at a cost of $250 million, for which the primary contractor will be RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Morocco has also been scrambling to secure Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet to enhance its aerial capabilities vis-à-vis Algeria which recently upgraded its air force with the acquisition of Russian combat jets like the Su-30 and MiG-29 and signed an agreement in 2020 to buy 14 Russian SU57 stealth fighters. Rabat is hopeful that its strong relations with Israel, which has seen Tel Aviv recognising Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, will help secure a deal with the US for the F-35 fighter jets. The Moroccan air force already has an active fleet of 15 F-16 fighter jets. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Egypt has also been looking to strengthen its defense systems with American air radars. The US government in January 2022, approved the sale of three SPS-48 land-based radars to be produced by L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) at a cost of $355 million. The radars offer excellent jamming immunity and are capable of detecting even extremely small targets. A year earlier in February 2021, it was reported that the US sold Egypt Rolling Airframe Missiles made by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for a deal valued at $197 million.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 most powerful militaries in Africa using a variety of key metrics covering ground forces, air force, and naval capabilities. Moreover, we have also weighed in factors that are often overlooked, such as GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels of countries, all three of which are critical for military success. Only a strong economy is able to raise and sustain a potent military force. On the other hand technological advancement coupled with defense spending often give a key edge to certain militaries over others.Therefore, we have assigned 40% weightage to GDP, defense spending, and technological advancement levels in our analysis. while the remaining 60% is made up of militaries’ strengths in manpower, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, aircrafts including fighter jets, and naval fleet.We listed countries based on how well they rank on each individual metric and then applied these weights in our calculations to get an average ranking score for each country. The 15 most powerful militaries in Africa are ranked in descending order of these average ranking scores.Data to generate this list has been sourced from Yahoo’s recent articles, 50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023, 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023, and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa. We also consulted Insider Monkey’s recent piece, 15 Countries that have the Best Economy in Africa, Global Firepower Index 2023, Flight International 2023, and Global Innovation Index 2022.15 Most Powerful Militaries in AfricaLMspencer / Shutterstock.comLet’s now head over to the list of the most powerful militaries in Africa.15.

(NYSE:VZ) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/64-institutional-ownership-verizon-communications-130027504.html,1697374827,STORY,['VZ'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Verizon Communications' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Verizon Communications, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Verizon Communications. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Verizon Communications' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Verizon Communications. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.1% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Verizon Communications Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$36m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 36% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Verizon Communications , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The expectation now is that they’ll help pick up the slack from industries like energy and health care that are still mired in an earnings slump.The five biggest companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — account for about a quarter of the benchmark’s market capitalization. Their earnings are projected to jump 34% from a year earlier on average, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.The S&amp;P 500 as a whole isn’t looking nearly as strong. The index’s profits are expected to be roughly flat, but they’d face a drop of around 5% without those five behemoths.“It’s very important for the big tech stocks to deliver” and bolster confidence broadly, said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management. “The Street expects earnings to be good across the board. Megacap tech stocks have whatever it takes to lead the market in the final quarter of the year.”Leading the MarketSoaring interest rates have rattled markets this month with the 10-year Treasury yield hitting the highest in more than a decade. A hotter-than-expected inflation report has investors bracing for the Federal Reserve to keep policy tight, and potentially hike again. That backdrop has reignited fears about a potential recession that have only been heightened by conflict in the Mideast.Story continuesTech stocks have faltered in the face of those headwinds, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbling for two straight months. But they’ve still hugely outperformed the overall market. The five key big-tech companies account for the bulk of the S&amp;P 500’s 13% advance this year.Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. are scheduled to kick off tech-related earnings Wednesday. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. report the following week. Apple announces Nov. 2 and Nvidia on Nov. 21.After robust second-quarter earnings, “we need to see more of the same in the third-quarter results,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. Given their big weighting, “you can bet that the rest of the market will play follow the leader as big tech earnings unfold this quarter.”He said he sees “fairly low odds of a tech earnings wreck this quarter.”Investors have good reason to be optimistic. In the past century, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied during reporting season about two-thirds of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Roadblocks AheadOne potential roadblock to an earnings-fueled rally is that a lot of the anticipated good news may be priced in. Alphabet and Amazon have gained more than 50% this year, while Apple and Microsoft have advanced nearly 40%.On top of rising profit expectations, the stocks have benefited from bets that the tech giants are best positioned to capitalize on generative artificial intelligence. That’s despite Nvidia, whose shares have tripled this year, being the only one to show a substantial financial boost from the trend.A source of concern for investors is that even with recent declines, big tech’s stock-market valuations are still elevated. Apple and Microsoft are priced at about 27 and 29 times estimated earnings, respectively, well above averages over the past decade. That figure is around 18 for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.Expensive share prices put pressure on companies to deliver strong earnings, according to Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.“They have to constantly deliver or they will lose the attention of investors,” she said in an interview. “Somebody needs to keep buying, and these rich valuations need to be justified.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia has rallied more than 200% this year, boosted by the artificial intelligence frenzy that has gripped Wall Street. However, the stock is still far from the average analyst price target, suggesting that the brokers expect the stock to rise about 44% in the next 12 months. Shares of the semiconductor company were little changed in Monday trading.Top Tech StoriesThe US plans to tighten sweeping measures to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors and chipmaking gear, seeking to prevent its geopolitical rival from obtaining cutting-edge technologies that could give it a military edge.Japanese chip-equipment maker Kokusai Electric Corp.’s initial public offering was priced at the top of an offered range, with shareholder KKR &amp; Co. set to raise ¥108 billion ($723 million) in the nation’s largest listing in nearly five years.Atos SE announced that Chairman Bertrand Meunier is stepping down and pushed back the sale of its legacy business to billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.Big tech companies like X Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are making it harder to stamp out misinformation and child exploitation materials on their platforms, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.GoTo Group plummeted its most on record after one of its co-founders trimmed his stake in a share sale, spurring concerns about the business prospects of a Southeast Asian industry bellwether.Earnings Due MondayNo major earnings expected--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and David Watkins.(Updates to add stock move in Tech Chart of the Day section.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekLululemon’s Founder Is Racing to Cure the Rare Disease Destroying His MusclesInflation Raging at 130% Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical PathThe Ozempic Effect Is Coming for Everything From Kidney to Heart Disease TreatmentsThe Price of Money Is Going Up, and It’s Not Because of the FedUBS Looks Beyond Credit Suisse to Bank Even More Billionaires©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

TRV is set to report third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 18. The insurer delivered a negative surprise of 97.36% in the last reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderTravelers’ third-quarter results are likely to benefit from solid performance across its three segments.Strong retention rates, positive renewal premium changes, new business premiums and better pricing are likely to have favored premiums in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums is pegged at $9.6 billion, indicating an 11.3% increase from the year-ago reported number. We estimate premiums to increase 8.7% to $9.4 billion.Travelers expects after-tax net investment income from the non-fixed income portfolio in the third quarter, including earnings from short-term securities of about $570 million. A better interest rate environment, stronger long-term average yields, a higher average level of fixed maturity investments and improved invested assets are likely to aid investment results in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is pegged at $724 million, indicating an improvement of 22.1% from the year-ago reported number. We estimate the metric to increase 10.4% to $655 million.Higher pricing and renewal premium change at the profitable agency auto and homeowners and other business are likely to aid results of the Personal Insurance segment in the quarter to be reported. We estimate earned premiums at Personal Insurance to be $3.6 billion, indicating an improvement of 7.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Higher net written premiums coupled with an increase in net investment income and other revenues are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $10.5 billion, indicating an 11.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Higher-than-expected cat losses are likely to have weighed on underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, better pricing and increased exposure are likely to have aided the combined ratio in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the combined ratio is pegged at 98, which has remained unchanged from the year-ago reported figure. We estimate the combined ratio to be 99.5.The continued share buybacks are anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.However, expenses are expected to have risen on higher claims and claim adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred acquisition costs, general and administrative expenses as well as interest expense.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $2.93, suggesting a decline of 33.1% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Travelers this time around. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). That is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Travelers has an Earnings ESP of -2.39%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.86, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Genuine Parts. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Genuine Parts?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Genuine Parts does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock.

However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Genuine Parts' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Genuine Parts. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.2% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Genuine PartsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Genuine Parts Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$63m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Genuine Parts. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Now, it is on the brink, with just enough cash left to make it to Thanksgiving.The tale of Tractiv's dramatic reversal in fortunes is emblematic of the times. Marvel, a unit of Walt Disney, initially planned to use Tractiv's software in a post-production process, documents show. But layoffs at Disney and the Hollywood strikes threw a wrench in the works.At the same time, a pullback in venture capital due to higher interest rates meant funding dried up. Drew Orsinger, Tractiv's co-founder and CEO, said he needs $600,000 to $700,000 to keep going for a few more months, time he needs for Hollywood to return to work and for talks with other potential customers to get traction.He's not sure he will succeed. ""We are not throwing in the towel, but we are struggling,"" said Orsinger, 49.Disney and Marvel declined to comment.Tractiv's tribulations are detailed here based on interviews with nearly half a dozen executives and investors familiar with the startup and a review of company documents. They provide rare, sometimes blow-by-blow insight into the hardship facing startups, key drivers of American innovation.Many of Tractiv's challenges are typical of an early-stage company as well as a consequence of risks it took, such as trying to break into a clubby industry outside its area of expertise. Nevertheless, its experience also shows how a momentous shift over the past year to higher interest rates has left startups more vulnerable to external shocks.A shakeout in the industry may eventually prove to be cathartic. But for now, more pain is likely, as companies burn through cash, the economy slows and funding remains tight.Venture capital funding for early-stage companies, called a pre-seed round, has dropped dramatically this year after a post-pandemic boom, with the number of U.S. deals falling to their lowest level in 13 years, PitchBook data shows.Story continues""The bar has been raised for what opportunities they're prepared to put money into,"" said Mark Almeida, a former senior Moody's executive and director of Tractiv.BIG BREAKOrsinger, who has worked as the chief security officer at SpaceX, CME Group and Honeywell, started Tractiv at the height of the pandemic in April 2020 with $600,000 from friends, family and his savings. His idea was to build software that could help companies keep track of data as it moved from point to point -- a long-standing problem in financial services.In February 2021, Tractiv got a major break when it gave a demonstration of the software to venture capital firms.Orsinger said Hans Morris, managing partner of venture firm Nyca Partners, called him afterwards. ""I don't know exactly where or how your tech will be used, but I'm willing to pay to find out,"" Orsinger said Morris told him.Nyca, which manages about $1 billion, invested $2 million in Tractiv for an 18% stake, valuing the company at $11 million in November 2021.The next few months Tractiv had a series of conversations with major financial services companies, including banks such as JPMorgan Chase. Several showed interest in Tractiv's software but did not buy it.JPMorgan declined to comment.Around then, an unexpected avenue started to get traction. A Marvel contact from Orsinger's days at SpaceX had opened a conversation a few months before about possible use of Tractiv in the movie industry.'IT'S TOUGH' In a memo dated Jan. 30, Marvel's global security and content protection team called Tractiv's software, Traxion, ""a next generation content delivery system"" that would allow it to trace what happens to its data once it goes to a third party – a boon for an industry that deals with leaks of movie trailers and piracy. They recommended moving toward a contract with Tractiv.The prospect of the deal persuaded Nyca, which normally sticks to financial technology, to make an additional $500,000 investment in Tractiv at a $20 million valuation. Orsinger also raised $200,000 more from family and friends.Nyca's Morris said the idea was to give Tractiv time to close on the deal with Marvel and find another investor that understood the media and entertainment industry.Then it ran into headwinds. On Feb. 9, Disney announced a sweeping restructuring, cutting 7,000 jobs in waves over the ensuing months, making it – as one Marvel executive later explained – ""a really challenging time to introduce any new costs to the studio.""Tractiv pressed forward. It applied to become an official Disney vendor, an approval it got in early May, and built features to meet Marvel's needs.On May 2, the Hollywood writers went on strike, followed by actors in July – the first time both unions had gone on strike since 1960. Production ground to a halt.Disney continued to be interested through at least mid-August, a document shows. Then, abruptly after a couple of weeks of silence, Orsinger was told that Disney needed to ""pause our interaction on the product at this point.""In a bid to conserve cash, Orsinger has reduced staff from 10 to 8 and cut salaries. He and his brother, who also works at Tractiv, have not taken a salary since December. Tractiv is exploring all options -- new investors, sale of the technology and other use cases, such as artificial intelligence.Asked how he and his family were coping with the uncertainty, Orsinger said, ""It's tough. It's kind of like, 'How much longer do we keep doing this?'""(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Editing by Anna Driver)]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global sporting and athletic goods market, you can go directly to 5 Best US Cities for Athletes.The US ranks high among the countries that produce the best athletes in the world. Cities around the country offer a wide variety of athletic facilities, play places, and other strong attractions for athletes. However, some cities in the US are better equipped than others.Before we talk about the 20 best US cities for athletes, let’s take a look at the sporting and athletic goods market and what some of the key players are up to.The Sporting and Athletic Goods Market: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global sporting and athletic goods market size was valued at $179.1 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $238.89 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The growing popularity of national and international sporting tournaments and leagues is attracting a strong following worldwide. This has led to a surge in the number of people participating in sports at various levels, which is a key driving factor for the increase in demand for sports and athletic goods. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of people are now looking for ways to create customized workout routines in the comfort of their own homes. The growing trend of home fitness is fueling the demand for sporting and fitness products, which is further augmenting market growth. Additionally, health and wellness trends, celebrity endorsements, and the increasing influence of social media platforms are all driving growth in the global sports goods market.Key Market PlayersThe sporting and athletic goods market is highly competitive and consists of regional and international competitors. Some of the biggest companies in the market are NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA), and Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU).Story continuesLululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) is a multinational athletic apparel retailer and one of the best sporting goods stocks to buy. On September 27, the company announced a five-year strategic global partnership with Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON). Through this partnership deal, Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) will become the exclusive digital fitness content provider for Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) while also making Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON). This partnership will expand brand awareness and reach for both companies as the two brands collaborate on technical athletic apparel, real-world experiences, and original content to engage with their global community of members in the US, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom.Some of the companies in this space are also offering loyalty programs. By offering rewards and benefits to loyal customers, sporting goods companies encourage them to keep buying their products and engaging with their business. This helps increase sales and profitability while also allowing the sporting and athletic goods companies to build stronger relationships with their customers.On August 1, Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA) announced that US based consumers that are 16 years or older can now enroll and start earning points with Under Armour Inc.’s (NYSE:UA) “UA Rewards” loyalty program. Users can earn points through purchases, product reviews, and UA MapMyRun Challenges. This is the company’s first ever loyalty program, which will allow consumers to connect more deeply with the brand in new and rewarding ways. President and CEO of Under Armour Inc. (NYSE:UA) Stephanie Linnartz said:“UA Rewards is a diverse program offering value to consumers, including celebrity athlete experiences and exclusive wellness content.”Some of the companies are investing heavily in research and development to create new and innovative products. On July 26, Forbes reported that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has unveiled the new ReactX foam in their InfinityRN 4 running shoes. Developing a new foam that is both high-performing and sustainable was not an easy task according to senior product director Bret Schoolmeester, but NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has succeeded after five years of research and development. Made using an injection molding process instead of a compression molding process, the ReactX foam offers a 13% increase in energy return to the runner. Energy return is a key goal for any performance foam. Like everyone else, athletes lose energy with every step, which makes it harder to keep going. A foam that returns energy to the runner can help athletes achieve faster times or simply feel better during their workouts.NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is one of the top sports companies that are delivering strong financials in 2023. On September 28, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024.

The tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index gained over 29% since the start of the year, well above the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s performance of under 13% during the same period. Still, harsh realities cannot be ignored.For example, in the trailing one-month period, the Nasdaq slipped more than 2%. Relatively speaking, that’s a better performance than the S&amp;P 500’s print of down 3.2%. Nevertheless, neither index has demonstrated a decisively superior weathering of the storm. Therefore, the concept of tech stocks with dividends should appeal to concerned market participants.Effectively, investors will be getting the best of both worlds. With tech dividend stocks, they’re exposed to the long-term fortunes of established innovation juggernauts. At the same time, they can collect passive income while waiting for the upside to materialize.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, no investment is without risk.

Further, the IT consultancy sector suffered a fall in spending as enterprises looked to save money. Nevertheless, Accenture believes that it can overcome the challenges the industry faces. Of course, there may be some frustrating sideways consolidation while waiting for shares to regain positive momentum.Story continuesWith that, investors may want to consider ACN as one of the tech dividend stocks. Currently, it carries a forward yield of 1.65%, which isn’t generous. However, it has a history of 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy. Interestingly, the high-side target comes in at $390, implying 25% growth.NetApp (NTAP)7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and IncomeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Jose, California, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) is a data storage and data management services company. Fundamentally, the data storage market offers significant upside. Per Fortune Business Insights, this sector will achieve a valuation of $247.32 billion this year. By 2030, the space will clock in at $777.98 billion. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8%.Right there, that’s enough reason to consider NTAP one of the tech stocks with dividends. Also, it’s a solid performer in terms of capital gains. Since the beginning of this year, NTAP moved up more than 24%. Enticingly, there could still be some growth remaining. Right now, shares trade at only 13.65x trailing earnings. In contrast, the underlying sector comes in at 21.54x.Regarding passive income, NetApp carries a forward yield of 2.65%. Just as well, the payout ratio sits at 32.47%, making NTAP one of the top tech dividend stocks. Per TipRanks, analysts peg NTAP as a moderate buy with an $80.80 target, implying 7% upside.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockA multinational IT company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is a business-focused entity, working in servers, storage, networking, containerization software, and consulting and support. According to Future Market Insights, the global software containers market may hit a valuation of $9.64 billion by 2032. That’s up significantly from the $3.256 billion valuation it achieved last year.Based on this information, this segment alone may enjoy a CAGR of 11.5%. That would be great news for HPE, which operates under a competitive paradigm. Since the start of the year, shares gained just under 5%, which isn’t that inspiring. However, in the trailing one-year period, HPE skyrocketed just over 35%. Therefore, the potential is there.While you’re waiting, you can pick up a forward yield of 2.85%. Enticingly, the payout ratio sits at only 22.31%, providing strong confidence for yield sustainability. Thus, HPE is a top player among tech dividend stocks. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with an $18.40 target, implying over 9% growth potential.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comBased in San Diego, California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks among the top multinational innovators. Per its public profile, it creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. Because of its established presence, QCOM also happens to be one of the tech stocks with dividends. Unfortunately, its performance this year hasn’t been impressive to put it diplomatically.Since the January opener, QCOM gained just over 3%. Fundamentally, the broader semiconductor industry faced significant concerns and still does. With demand for smartphones and PCs waning, Qualcomm’s total addressable market took a hit. However, the underperformance also means that QCOM trades with a forward earnings multiple of 11.99x. That’s favorably lower than 79.33% of the chip industry.Looking at passive income, Qualcomm offers a forward yield of 2.89%. Also, the company features a history of 21 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s a great candidate for tech dividend stocks. Lastly, analysts rate QCOM a moderate buy with a $135.35 target, implying 22% upside.Juniper Networks (JNPR)An image of the Juniper Networks, Inc. logo displayed on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comBased in Sunnyvale, California, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) is a multinational corporation that develops and markets networking products. These include routers, switches network management software, network security products, and software-defined networking technology. Naturally, all these specialties command exceptional relevance. However, the security element distinguishes JNPR as a top candidate for tech dividend stocks.In August, household goods giant Clorox (NYSE:CLX) disclosed it suffered a serious cyberattack. Recently, the company revealed the extent of the financial harm through its preliminary fiscal first-quarter report. Unsurprisingly, the news took investors by shock, who subsequently exited out of CLX as fast as they could. By logical deduction, the incident only served to underscore the importance of holistic cybersecurity.The other element that bolsters JNPR is the passive income. Here, Juniper offers a forward yield of 3.31%. Just as encouragingly, the payout ratio sits at 37.36%, making JNPR one of the most attractive tech stocks with dividends.Analysts peg JNPR as a moderate buy with a $32.64 target, implying nearly 23% growth.RTX (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comUnderstandably a controversial company, RTX (NYSE:RTX) recently underwent a name change. Previously, it operated under the banner Raytheon Technologies. More than likely, the move won’t stop investors from viewing the firm as one of the top defense contractors. However, it also enjoys other avenues working in its favor, such as the space economy. As such, RTX ranks among the best tech dividend stocks.According to McKinsey &amp; Company, the space market – which recently grew to approximately $447 billion – could hit a valuation of $1 trillion by 2030. Just as importantly if not more so, many countries are competing for dominance in space. Naturally, not all of these nations are friendly to the U.S. and the West in general. So, like it or not, RTX is supremely important.Turning to passive income, RTX commands a forward yield of 3.38%. Also, it enjoys 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s one of the tech stocks with dividends to put on your shortlist.Lastly, analysts rate RTX as a moderate buy with an $88.29 target, implying almost 27% upside.International Business Machines (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVOne of the tech dividend stocks that arguably gets more attention for its passive income rather than its innovations, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has long symbolized a frustrating case for investors. On one hand, it’s difficult to ignore its rich history. Founded in 1911, “Big Blue” as it’s known has gone through multiple bullish and bearish cycles. Still, on the flip side, it hasn’t kept pace with modern competitors.Since the start of the year, IBM stock gained only slightly above parity. In the past 60 months, shares have returned less than 6%. I’m sorry but as an innovator, that’s difficult to swallow. Still, a case could be made that it’s unfairly overlooked. Given its decades of research with artificial intelligence protocols, Big Blue deserves at least some consideration. Plus, it only trades at a forward earnings multiple of 14.07X.What can be said is that IBM provides a big dividend. Its forward yield stands at 4.68%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, it commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Finally, analysts only rate it a hold with a $147.27 target, implying under 4% growth. Still, this could be deeply off based on its valuation.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the Top 10 Places Where the Rich People Own Real Estate.Real estate is a diverse industry that involves buying, selling, construction, renting, and management of properties such as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The global economic crises have negatively impacted the real estate industry over the past few years. According to IBISWorld, the global commercial real estate industry revenue is projected to drop to $4.3 trillion by the end of 2023, at a rate of 2.5% per year from 2018. This includes an expected increase of 1.6% in revenue in 2023 due to a slightly improved economy following the reopening of global markets after the COVID-19 pandemic. Knight Frank in its Wealth Report shared that there will be changes in investment strategies of the wealthiest people considering the ongoing challenges. As per the report, around 69% of wealthy investors expect growth in their portfolios in 2023. According to the respondents of the Wealth Report, 31% said investors will target capital growth, 26% pointed to capital preservation, and 23% said that income generation will be the main focus for investors. Around a third of investors will seek property investments to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. Hot Properties for Rich PeopleAccording to Knight Frank’s Prime International Residential Index (PIRI 100), average luxury house price growth declined to 5.2% in 2022. Despite the decline, almost 17% of the global ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) bought a home in 2022, the second strongest year on record. Out of 100 markets, around 85 reported positive price growth in 2022 with Dubai leading by 44.2%, Aspen by 27.6%, and Riyadh by 25%. The sales of prime residential properties, worth $10 million or more, plunged in 2022 compared to 2021 but were 49% higher than in 2019. New York, Los Angeles, and London remained the top places with the highest sales in real estate in 2022. While ultra-prime properties, worth $25 million or more, saw higher sales in New York and London. Story continuesIn 2024, the luxury real estate market is expected to improve. Almost 19% of UHNWIs plan to invest directly in income-producing properties, while 13% intend to take the indirect, or passive, approach. The most in-demand properties in 2024 are going to be healthcare, logistics, offices, and residential. Knight Frank’s report suggests that offices are expected to lead the real estate market in 2024, with London expected to be the top target. In 2023, US investors are expected to propel almost 50% of the cross-border volumes in real estate, with strong demand projected from the UK, UAE, Singapore, Canada, and Switzerland. Where Do the Super Rich Live?The US has the most number of billionaire citizens, with 735 individuals having an accumulated net worth of $4.5 trillion. China ranks second with 495 billionaires, who add $1.67 trillion to the Chinese economy. India has 169 billionaires and Germany is home to 126 billionaire citizens. The top countries with the most billionaires per capita are led by Hong Kong with 66 billionaires, Singapore with 35 billionaires, and Switzerland with 41 billionaires - to name a few. These countries are among the top places where the rich people own real estate. The wealthiest cities in the world that have the highest number of ultra-rich people include New York City, Tokyo, The Bay Area, London, Singapore, and Los Angeles, among others. Major Players in the IndustryReal estate is a massive industry and continues to grow each year, thanks to mega commercial and residential projects managed by top real estate companies. One of the most valuable real estate companies in the world, Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) continues its growth and its global presence in the logistics facilities. On June 26, Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) announced that they have signed a definitive agreement with Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) to acquire industrial properties for $3.1 billion. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) will purchase 14 million square feet of industrial properties from real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX). Acquisition of this property will add to the company's presence in key markets in logistics real estate. Dubai’s leading real estate firm Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR) is a major player in the region. On September 28, Bloomberg reported that Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR) is looking for opportunities to obtain housing community contracts in Saudi Arabia. Contracts worth $250 billion have been awarded by the Saudi government since 2016. As per the founder of Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR), Mohamed Alabbar, the company could begin construction of a 4,000-unit housing project if they reach an agreement with the Saudi government. “We’re in serious discussions with the Ministry of Housing on working together,” said Alabbar. Another big player in the real estate industry is Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). On July 24, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) reported that it signed a deal with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) to acquire Simply Self Storage for $2.2 billion. Simply Self Storage owns 127 wholly-owned properties in highly populated markets. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is looking to expand its market presence in the storage space.Now that we have discussed what some of the top real estate companies in the world are up to, let's take a look at the places where rich people own real estate.Top 100 Places Where the Rich People Own Real EstateTop 100 Places Where the Rich People Own Real EstateOur MethodologyFor our methodology, we sourced the top 100 places where rich people own real estate from Knight Frank’s Wealth Report of 2023.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the Top 10 Places Where the Rich People Own Real Estate.Real estate is a diverse industry that involves buying, selling, construction, renting, and management of properties such as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The global economic crises have negatively impacted the real estate industry over the past few years. According to IBISWorld, the global commercial real estate industry revenue is projected to drop to $4.3 trillion by the end of 2023, at a rate of 2.5% per year from 2018. This includes an expected increase of 1.6% in revenue in 2023 due to a slightly improved economy following the reopening of global markets after the COVID-19 pandemic. Knight Frank in its Wealth Report shared that there will be changes in investment strategies of the wealthiest people considering the ongoing challenges. As per the report, around 69% of wealthy investors expect growth in their portfolios in 2023. According to the respondents of the Wealth Report, 31% said investors will target capital growth, 26% pointed to capital preservation, and 23% said that income generation will be the main focus for investors. Around a third of investors will seek property investments to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. Hot Properties for Rich PeopleAccording to Knight Frank’s Prime International Residential Index (PIRI 100), average luxury house price growth declined to 5.2% in 2022. Despite the decline, almost 17% of the global ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) bought a home in 2022, the second strongest year on record. Out of 100 markets, around 85 reported positive price growth in 2022 with Dubai leading by 44.2%, Aspen by 27.6%, and Riyadh by 25%. The sales of prime residential properties, worth $10 million or more, plunged in 2022 compared to 2021 but were 49% higher than in 2019. New York, Los Angeles, and London remained the top places with the highest sales in real estate in 2022. While ultra-prime properties, worth $25 million or more, saw higher sales in New York and London. Story continuesIn 2024, the luxury real estate market is expected to improve. Almost 19% of UHNWIs plan to invest directly in income-producing properties, while 13% intend to take the indirect, or passive, approach. The most in-demand properties in 2024 are going to be healthcare, logistics, offices, and residential. Knight Frank’s report suggests that offices are expected to lead the real estate market in 2024, with London expected to be the top target. In 2023, US investors are expected to propel almost 50% of the cross-border volumes in real estate, with strong demand projected from the UK, UAE, Singapore, Canada, and Switzerland. Where Do the Super Rich Live?The US has the most number of billionaire citizens, with 735 individuals having an accumulated net worth of $4.5 trillion. China ranks second with 495 billionaires, who add $1.67 trillion to the Chinese economy. India has 169 billionaires and Germany is home to 126 billionaire citizens. The top countries with the most billionaires per capita are led by Hong Kong with 66 billionaires, Singapore with 35 billionaires, and Switzerland with 41 billionaires - to name a few. These countries are among the top places where the rich people own real estate. The wealthiest cities in the world that have the highest number of ultra-rich people include New York City, Tokyo, The Bay Area, London, Singapore, and Los Angeles, among others. Major Players in the IndustryReal estate is a massive industry and continues to grow each year, thanks to mega commercial and residential projects managed by top real estate companies.

Acquisition of this property will add to the company's presence in key markets in logistics real estate. Dubai’s leading real estate firm Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR) is a major player in the region. On September 28, Bloomberg reported that Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR) is looking for opportunities to obtain housing community contracts in Saudi Arabia. Contracts worth $250 billion have been awarded by the Saudi government since 2016. As per the founder of Emaar Properties PJSC (DFM:EMAAR), Mohamed Alabbar, the company could begin construction of a 4,000-unit housing project if they reach an agreement with the Saudi government. “We’re in serious discussions with the Ministry of Housing on working together,” said Alabbar. Another big player in the real estate industry is Public Storage (NYSE:PSA).

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:50% = US$10b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.50 in profit.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Parcel Service has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 50% ROEUnited Parcel Service clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.02. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

143,9e724786-6dc1-33ab-828d-6a7e703da134,NTAP,2023-10-16,7 Tech Stocks That Also Pay You to Own Them,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-tech-stocks-pay-own-005730569.html,1696899450,STORY,"['ACN', 'NTAP', 'QCOM', 'JNPR', 'RTX', 'HPE']","[Undeniably, the innovation space has been the darling of Wall Street, although shifting sands may prompt a discussion about tech dividend stocks. The tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index gained over 29% since the start of the year, well above the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s performance of under 13% during the same period. Still, harsh realities cannot be ignored.For example, in the trailing one-month period, the Nasdaq slipped more than 2%. Relatively speaking, that’s a better performance than the S&amp;P 500’s print of down 3.2%. Nevertheless, neither index has demonstrated a decisively superior weathering of the storm. Therefore, the concept of tech stocks with dividends should appeal to concerned market participants.Effectively, investors will be getting the best of both worlds. With tech dividend stocks, they’re exposed to the long-term fortunes of established innovation juggernauts. At the same time, they can collect passive income while waiting for the upside to materialize.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, no investment is without risk. However, buying established innovators that pay may provide a nice balance. On that note, below are tech stocks with dividends to consider.Accenture (ACN)A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.Source: Tada Images/ShutterStock.comA professional services firm, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) specializes in information technology services and consulting. Part of the esteemed Global Fortune 500, Accenture offers vast relevancies. As a result, shares gained almost 16% of equity value since the start of the year. That’s the case even with a contested ecosystem in the innovation space.Still, it can’t be ignored that ACN went flat at the end of May this year. Further, the IT consultancy sector suffered a fall in spending as enterprises looked to save money. Nevertheless, Accenture believes that it can overcome the challenges the industry faces. Of course, there may be some frustrating sideways consolidation while waiting for shares to regain positive momentum.Story continuesWith that, investors may want to consider ACN as one of the tech dividend stocks. Currently, it carries a forward yield of 1.65%, which isn’t generous. However, it has a history of 19 years of consecutive dividend increases.Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy. Interestingly, the high-side target comes in at $390, implying 25% growth.NetApp (NTAP)7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and IncomeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Jose, California, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) is a data storage and data management services company. Fundamentally, the data storage market offers significant upside. Per Fortune Business Insights, this sector will achieve a valuation of $247.32 billion this year. By 2030, the space will clock in at $777.98 billion. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8%.Right there, that’s enough reason to consider NTAP one of the tech stocks with dividends. Also, it’s a solid performer in terms of capital gains. Since the beginning of this year, NTAP moved up more than 24%. Enticingly, there could still be some growth remaining. Right now, shares trade at only 13.65x trailing earnings. In contrast, the underlying sector comes in at 21.54x.Regarding passive income, NetApp carries a forward yield of 2.65%. Just as well, the payout ratio sits at 32.47%, making NTAP one of the top tech dividend stocks. Per TipRanks, analysts peg NTAP as a moderate buy with an $80.80 target, implying 7% upside.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockA multinational IT company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is a business-focused entity, working in servers, storage, networking, containerization software, and consulting and support. According to Future Market Insights, the global software containers market may hit a valuation of $9.64 billion by 2032. That’s up significantly from the $3.256 billion valuation it achieved last year.Based on this information, this segment alone may enjoy a CAGR of 11.5%. That would be great news for HPE, which operates under a competitive paradigm. Since the start of the year, shares gained just under 5%, which isn’t that inspiring. However, in the trailing one-year period, HPE skyrocketed just over 35%. Therefore, the potential is there.While you’re waiting, you can pick up a forward yield of 2.85%. Enticingly, the payout ratio sits at only 22.31%, providing strong confidence for yield sustainability. Thus, HPE is a top player among tech dividend stocks. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with an $18.40 target, implying over 9% growth potential.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comBased in San Diego, California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks among the top multinational innovators. Per its public profile, it creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. Because of its established presence, QCOM also happens to be one of the tech stocks with dividends. Unfortunately, its performance this year hasn’t been impressive to put it diplomatically.Since the January opener, QCOM gained just over 3%. Fundamentally, the broader semiconductor industry faced significant concerns and still does. With demand for smartphones and PCs waning, Qualcomm’s total addressable market took a hit. However, the underperformance also means that QCOM trades with a forward earnings multiple of 11.99x. That’s favorably lower than 79.33% of the chip industry.Looking at passive income, Qualcomm offers a forward yield of 2.89%. Also, the company features a history of 21 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s a great candidate for tech dividend stocks. Lastly, analysts rate QCOM a moderate buy with a $135.35 target, implying 22% upside.Juniper Networks (JNPR)An image of the Juniper Networks, Inc. logo displayed on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comBased in Sunnyvale, California, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) is a multinational corporation that develops and markets networking products. These include routers, switches network management software, network security products, and software-defined networking technology. Naturally, all these specialties command exceptional relevance. However, the security element distinguishes JNPR as a top candidate for tech dividend stocks.In August, household goods giant Clorox (NYSE:CLX) disclosed it suffered a serious cyberattack. Recently, the company revealed the extent of the financial harm through its preliminary fiscal first-quarter report. Unsurprisingly, the news took investors by shock, who subsequently exited out of CLX as fast as they could. By logical deduction, the incident only served to underscore the importance of holistic cybersecurity.The other element that bolsters JNPR is the passive income. Here, Juniper offers a forward yield of 3.31%. Just as encouragingly, the payout ratio sits at 37.36%, making JNPR one of the most attractive tech stocks with dividends.Analysts peg JNPR as a moderate buy with a $32.64 target, implying nearly 23% growth.RTX (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comUnderstandably a controversial company, RTX (NYSE:RTX) recently underwent a name change. Previously, it operated under the banner Raytheon Technologies. More than likely, the move won’t stop investors from viewing the firm as one of the top defense contractors. However, it also enjoys other avenues working in its favor, such as the space economy. As such, RTX ranks among the best tech dividend stocks.According to McKinsey &amp; Company, the space market – which recently grew to approximately $447 billion – could hit a valuation of $1 trillion by 2030. Just as importantly if not more so, many countries are competing for dominance in space. Naturally, not all of these nations are friendly to the U.S. and the West in general. So, like it or not, RTX is supremely important.Turning to passive income, RTX commands a forward yield of 3.38%. Also, it enjoys 30 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s one of the tech stocks with dividends to put on your shortlist.Lastly, analysts rate RTX as a moderate buy with an $88.29 target, implying almost 27% upside.International Business Machines (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVOne of the tech dividend stocks that arguably gets more attention for its passive income rather than its innovations, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has long symbolized a frustrating case for investors. On one hand, it’s difficult to ignore its rich history. Founded in 1911, “Big Blue” as it’s known has gone through multiple bullish and bearish cycles. Still, on the flip side, it hasn’t kept pace with modern competitors.Since the start of the year, IBM stock gained only slightly above parity. In the past 60 months, shares have returned less than 6%. I’m sorry but as an innovator, that’s difficult to swallow. Still, a case could be made that it’s unfairly overlooked. Given its decades of research with artificial intelligence protocols, Big Blue deserves at least some consideration. Plus, it only trades at a forward earnings multiple of 14.07X.What can be said is that IBM provides a big dividend. Its forward yield stands at 4.68%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, it commands 30 years of consecutive dividend increases.Finally, analysts only rate it a hold with a $147.27 target, implying under 4% growth.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 131% in five years. In the last week shares have slid back 1.8%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Tractor Supply To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Tractor Supply managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 18% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Tractor Supply has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Tractor Supply's TSR for the last 5 years was 149%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveTractor Supply provided a TSR of 2.9% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 20% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Tractor Supply better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Tractor Supply   you should know about.We will like Tractor Supply better if we see some big insider buys.

However, just because an analyst has changed his or her rating on a stock from “buy” to “hold,” from “buy” to “sell” or from “hold” to “sell,” doesn’t mean you need to follow suit.Much like everyday investors get it wrong, and the so-called “smart money” institutional investors get it wrong, the sell-side analyst community can get it wrong sometimes as well.Here’s a good example. It’s not uncommon for analysts to place too much emphasis on a negative macro, industry, or company-specific factor. Either macro positives counter this or it winds up having a minimal effect.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat appears to be the situation here, with the following seven stocks. All of them have received analyst downgrades in the past week, but here’s why each one remains a buy.Adecoagro (AGRO)Cargo ship transporting goods. Maritime logistics. Logistics.Source: Travel mania / ShutterstockAdecoagro (NYSE:AGRO) is a large agro-industrial company in South America. A producer of grains, oilseeds, ethanol and dairy products, shares are up sharply (42.6%) year-to-date. Largely, due to strong results in recent quarters.However, after this strong run, analyst Daniel Sasson from Itau BBA has become a little cautious about AGRO stock. At least, that’s the takeaway, based on Sasson’s Oct. 2 downgrade of shares from “outperform” to “market perform.” Yet while another 42.6% run may not be in the cards over the coming year, I wouldn’t immediately dismiss the potential for Adecoagro to deliver outsized gains from here.Already trading at a discounted 6.5 times forward earnings, if the contrarian view on grain prices proves correct, and elevated prices for food commodities are here to stay, AGRO could re-rate to a higher valuation, as it becomes clear high profitability is here to stay as well.Emerson Electric (EMR)An office building with an Emerson Electric sign on it.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comOn Oct. 3, UBS’s Chris Snyder downgraded Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) from “buy” to “neutral.”Story continuesIn the analyst’s view, additional upside for the stock is limited because of the industrial technology company’s high exposure to the energy sector. Also, there’s uncertainty surrounding the impact on results of two recent large acquisitions.However, while one analyst has become less bullish on EMR stock, analysts at KeyBanc and Deutsche Bank have issued bullish ratings on shares recently. The Keybanc analyst (Ken Newman) cited favorable demand trends in his bullish initial rating on Emerson Electric.The Deutsche Bank analysts believe the market undervalued shares compared to peers and the company should beat expectations in its quarterly results this month.Taking both arguments into account, if you currently hold EMR, you may want to let it ride. These reasons to buy may outweigh Snyder’s “on the fence” view on shares.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, it has not been analyst downgrades that have hammered NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) shares lately.Yes, one sell-side firm (Keybanc) recently downgraded shares in this Florida-based utilities company from “overweight” to “sector weight.”However, this NEE stock downgrade has been in response to two negative developments.First, is the prospect of interest rates staying “higher for longer.” Second, is NextEra’s walking back of expectations for its NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) renewable energy subsidiary.Nevertheless, if you’ve been waiting to make this former “green wave” darling a buy, now may be your chance to do so.Why? After falling 23.8% in the past month, NEE has dropped to a far more reasonable valuation (16 times forward earnings), with a solid dividend yield (3.72%) to boot.If interest rates come down next year, and today’s growth worries prove to be an overreaction, NextEra Energy could make a strong comeback.Norfolk Southern (NSC)Source: ShutterstockOn Oct. 2, BofA’s Ken Hoexter downgraded Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). The analyst cited recent data center outages (including one incident on Sep. 29) as a key reason behind his downgrade of the railroad stock from “buy” to “neutral.”This downgrade, plus the latest data center outage incident itself, have placed pressure on NSC stock. However, you may not want to see these developments as reasons to sell/avoid shares.While for certain, it’s possible that concerns about the data outages wouldn’t be so high, if not for the Norfolk Southern’s headline-making train derailment earlier this year.In short, Hoexter and the market right now may be overestimating the operational and reputational risks with the data center issue.As NSC trades at a discount to peers, and has already written off the likely derailment damages ($803 million), shares could be a buy after this latest round of weakness.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)The front of an O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) store.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is another one of the stocks that has received analyst downgrades over the past week, but shares in the auto parts retailer have also been one of the stocks receiving an analyst upgrade over the past week as well.Oppenheimer’s Brian Nagel downgraded ORLY stock on Oct. 6 (from “outperform” to “perform”) because of less favorable industry dynamics. The previous day Citi’s Steve Zaccone upgraded O’Reilly from “neutral” to “buy,” citing the stock’s appeal as a defensive retail stock.So, who is most likely on the money here? I’d opt to follow Zaccone’s take on ORLY shares. Zaccone makes a strong point that other factors (like market share gains/improved margins) may counter recessionary pressures.I’ve called out ORLY as being pricey in past coverage, yet I’ll admit these positives may enable the stock to maintain its premium valuation.Sandy Spring Bancorp (SASR)a person holding an iphone in one hand and a credit card in the othrSource: apichon_tee/ShutterStock.comGiven the challenges the regional banking industry is facing right now, it’s no surprise that Sandy Spring Bancorp (NASDAQ:SASR) has just received an analyst downgrade.On Oct. 2, DA Davidson’s Manuel Navas downgraded SASR stock from “buy” to “neutral,” due to the current interest rate outlook.In Nava’s view, “higher for longer” is bad news for Sandy Spring’s commercial real estate lending operations. Yet while interest rate headwinds are clearly in play here, as I argued last month, this may already be accounted-for in SASR’s valuation.How so? After plunging in price over the past year, this bank now trades at a 40% discount to book value.Following the current storms, and once interest rates head back lower, SASR could make a very strong recovery. While this smaller name may be riskier than many other downgrade stocks, upside potential may exceed this risk.Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) was downgraded on Oct. 5, making it another one of last week’s analyst downgrades.Interestingly enough, this downgrade was another new rating from Citi’s Steven Zaccone. Zaccone included the downgrade of this retailer alongside the above-mentioned upgrade of ORLY stock.Zaccone now rates TSCO stock at “neutral” rather than “buy,” following the latest store traffic channel checks.Yet while Zaccone may be right about O’Reilly, it’s possible his view on Tractor Supply is too pessimistic. With shares already sliding in recent months, the prospect of a consumer slowdown could already be priced-in.Shares today trade for around 20 times earnings. This valuation may be more-than-fair, given the potential for an earnings growth resurgence in 2024 and 2025.Tractor Supply is also appealing as a dividend growth stock. TSCO’s dividend payouts have increased by around 28.2% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, for US$9.6m worth of shares, at about US$64.33 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$52.89. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Coca-Cola insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$1.5b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Coca-Cola, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Coca-Cola has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

154,47ad71a4-d6be-37a2-bd92-4ae1e75827c4,IR,2023-10-16,7 Undervalued Stocks to Combat Climate Change Head-On,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-stocks-combat-climate-120703803.html,1696939623,STORY,"['BP', 'ARRY', 'TT', 'LPX', 'ALB', 'NEE', 'SEDG']","[Climate change stocks are an important and controversial thematic area for investors. Runaway carbon emissions fears were overstated but net emissions continued to rise overall in 2022. Thus, carbon reduction will continue to matter to the markets and demand will persist. The market downturn last year prompted fear that gains over the last few years would wane. Yet investment into the sector continued to grow as measured by deal activity, capital deployments, and investment into dedicated funds. The picture appears murky but plenty of signs suggest that the future remains very bright for stocks in the sector. In particular, those that are undervalued at the moment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBP (BP)The BP (BP) logo on a sign against a blue sky with cloudsSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comBP (NYSE:BP) is an oil stock at its heart. Selling more oil at higher prices is the name of the game. In that regard, it’s not different from most of its American counterparts. As a European energy giant, it is more climate-change-forward. That means it is ahead of the curve relative to its American competitors in relation to most things green. The combination of current strong oil prices and climate change initiatives makes BP shares compelling at the moment. The company expects to have reduced its carbon emissions 2019 baseline by 10-15% by 2025. It plans to reduce emissions by as much as 30% by 2030 and to become net zero by 2050. Oil prices are high currently which gives BP a chance at higher revenues and profits in the short term. It’s that combination of future direction and current economic tailwinds that makes BP stock attractive. BP shares also happen to have momentum on their side right now. Array Technologies (ARRY) Graphic of skull on computer hardware with red glow beneath hardware. Tech stocks to sellSource: shutterstock.com/solarsevenThere are at least two strong reasons to invest in Array Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock that I can think of. First of all, Array Technologies is fundamentally strong while offering the benefits of a growth firm. The company, which sells solar ground mounting systems, reported profitability in the first half and in the second quarter. Array Technologies reported steep losses during both of those periods a year prior. Revenues grew by 21% in Q2 and are expected to grow by 30% through 2024. Story continuesTwo, Array Technologies is appealing to a broader base of investors with its recent moves to strengthen its domestic supply chain. Fort Wayne, Indiana’s Steel Dynamics is set to provide Array Technologies with coil for its U.S. projects. That steel coil will be produced at Steel Dynamics’ mills in Indiana, Texas, and Mississippi. The efforts de-politicize ARRY shares to a degree and that promises to increase overall demand for its stock. SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) Solar panels on rooftops in California, an increasingly common sight, solar stocksSource: Simone Hogan / Shutterstock.comIt’s very difficult to ignore SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) and its stocks right now. The company sells inverters that transform photovoltaic energy into electricity for use in homes. SEDG shares are very undervalued at their current price of just below $120. Those shares have ranged from $200 to $365 over the past 3 years. They’re so cheap currently because of Q3 guidance. The company basically stated that its revenues would be about 10% lower than the $1.05 billion Wall Street had anticipated. Rates are the issue. A lot of consumers take out loans to finance solar home projects. As long as rates remain stubbornly high, SEDG shares will continue to have trouble. I can’t predict when rates will ease. However, we can all assume that rates will come down sooner or later. That means an investor with a reasonable time horizon, let’s say 18 months, can buy and hold SEDG shares with a strong expectation of high returns. SEDG shares may get a bit lower since the Fed is going to raise rates by another 25 basis points but timing the market is a fool’s errand. A bit of confidence now is all that’s necessary. NextEra Energy (NEE) Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) should really be on any investors’ buy list of stocks for climate change who have patience and foresight. The firm is an interesting company because of the business mix it represents. It’s part utilities firm and part renewables firm. The utilities firm, Florida Power &amp; Light, is the biggest utilities firm in the U.S. The renewables business, NextEra Energy Resources, generates more wind and solar energy than any other firm globally. Normally, that would make NEE stock particularly appealing because it offers growth from the renewables side and income and stability from its utility business. It still does offer that mix currently but utilities firms are getting crushed due to high bond yields. Investors are piling into bonds yielding close to 5% risk-free returns. Utilities dividends tend to pale in comparison and investors have fled the sector. Thus, NEE shares are down. Bond yields are going to remain high into 2024 so NEE shares, like SEDG shares, will require patience. A resolute investor can make out very handsomely by simply placing capital into NEE shares now and waiting for a year. Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. Undervalued Lithium StocksSource: tunasalmon / ShutterstockAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is among the leading lithium stocks available to investors. The North Carolina firm is the largest producer of EV battery metal and burst into public consciousness over the past few years. It’s cheap for many reasons but it holds a strong place in the U.S. EV supply chain and is simply put, going to last. The firm announced a $90 million grant from the Department of Defense a few weeks ago. Arguing against the long-term strategic importance of Albemarle is pointless. The DoD understands the strategic importance of lithium sourcing and is tacitly approving EVs with this and other moves. The grant will fund Albemarle’s reopening of Kings Mountain in North Carolina further strengthening U.S. lithium production. Albemarle’s performance remains strong but lithium price volatility and overarching macroeconomic headwinds are souring the EV outlook. That makes it easy to ignore ALB at the moment which is exactly what the market has done. Those who get in now will receive modest dividend income, financial performance, and a strategically placed firm entrenched in the U.S. geopolitical fight for EV dominance.   Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) photo of walking space between two very tall stacks of processed timberSource: shutterstock.com/Free BelarusLouisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) makes engineered wood products for the construction sector. The stock is inexpensive at the moment. 100% of the wood fiber used in its products was sourced from certified standard forests and 80% of the thermal energy used in making its products was from renewable sources. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. is evolving with the times and has developed sustainability standards that matter. It is also dependent on home construction as a primary catalyst for its business. Sales have slumped recently. It is undervalued at the moment because of the slump and higher rates. However, Wall Street favors LPX shares as does Warren Buffett through Berkshire Hathaway which holds a significant portion of the firm’s equity. Revenues grew quickly over the past 3 years but have slowed of late. Warren Buffett bets on American resilience and his vote of confidence in LPX shares is worth considering as the economy lists in late 2023. All in all, it’s one of those climate change stocks to consider.Trane Technologies (TT)Offshore hydrocarbon plant.Source: Oil and Gas Photographer / ShutterstockTrane Technologies (NYSE:TT) is a relatively unheralded ESG stock because its business doesn’t receive much attention in relation to carbon emissions. Most investors think about oil when considering top carbon emitters. Buildings are also very important in that conversation. Heating buildings and cooling them down contributes to roughly 15% of all carbon emissions. That makes HVAC firms like Trane incredibly important even if they don’t get much attention.TT stock is solid, dependable, and headed in the right direction. Trane Technologies is expected to grow because commercial spaces are increasingly looking to lower their costs and emissions. Trane Technologies is a leader in the space. Internet of Things (IoT) opportunities are also on the rise and that suggests that many factors are conspiring in the firm’s favor. Trane Technologies may be boring in the eyes of most but all the signs point to long-term opportunities as it plods along at or above earnings expectations quarter after quarter. This makes it one of those stocks battling climate change.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

155,0089d3a1-7b0c-3630-b4b0-40502fff28fa,SRE,2023-10-16,7 Options Trades to Make You Money in a Flat Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-options-trades-money-flat-004530725.html,1696898730,STORY,"['NVDA', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'SRE', 'FIVE']","[Despite the surprisingly robust September jobs report that just came out, Wall Street hasn’t been that impressive overall, thus necessitating a discussion about options trades for a flat market. Listen, as much as I love talking about safe dividend stocks to buy for a tumultuous market, if the waste matter truly hits the proverbial fan, even the most trusted idea could temporarily falter.Another factor that bolsters the case for options trades for a flat market is the added avenues for profitable efficiencies. For example, how many times have you thought to yourself: I’d buy XYZ Corp but only if it got down to X price. If it did drop there, you buy. But what if XYZ never got to that magic price point? My goodness – you would have wasted your time.However, with cash-secured put selling, you can collect maximum premiums if your target security never falls to the underlying contract strike price. Conversely, you can conduct covered call writing to collect premiums on a security that you own but don’t believe will rise materially.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith options trades for a flat market, you can profit from practically any circumstance, just like the smart money.Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockBased on the latest trends, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) appears a tempting prospect for options trades for a flat market. Specifically, if I already own AAPL stock, I’d be interested in collecting a premium by writing (selling) call options. Remember, you want to own the underlying security in case the trade works against you; otherwise, you’d suffer (theoretically) unlimited losses.Here’s the rationale. As one of the most popular companies in the world, Apple commands incredible pricing power. Just look at how its gross margins rise despite challenges to the consumer economy. People will pay for the latest Apple gadgets and gizmos. However, because it’s such a predictable business, investors don’t anticipate robust growth for AAPL stock.Story continuesYes, shares gained 42% since the January opener. However, they’re flat on a trailing-month basis. If you don’t believe much upside for AAPL remains, writing covered calls will allow you to pick up a premium and make your holdings more “productive.”Of course, the risk is that if AAPL pops, you may be obligated to sell your holdings. For that, analysts project AAPL hitting $207.69 over the next 12 months.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWhile options trades for a flat market (or any market cycle) carry distinct risks, you must educate yourself on how they can be shrewd tools to profit from whatever the market throws at you. A case in point is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Another company that needs no introduction, Amazon continues to dominate the broader e-commerce ecosystem. It’s predictable and trustworthy but that also comes with problems.Basically, because it’s such a great investment, Wall Street doesn’t really anticipate much upside from here. Yeah, sure, it’s up 49% since the January opener. But in the past one-month period, AMZN slipped more than 7%. Further, its valuation makes seem unlikely that much upside beckons for the industry stalwart. Right now, AMZN trades at a trailing earnings multiple of nearly 101X.So, if you already own AMZN – keeping in mind that each options contract represents 100 shares – why not collect some income? Again, it just seems unlikely that AMZN will move higher. Here, you can check Fintel’s implied volatility (IV) curve, which seems to indicate that options traders generally anticipate a higher probability of downside than upside.If you want to do this trade, analysts project AMZN hitting $176.02 in the next 12 months.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.Source: Evolf / Shutterstock.comOne of the big winners in the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – while presenting risks – may also be a strong candidate for options trades for a flat market. Yes, that almost sounds sacrilegious. After all, Nvidia’s processors help empower artificial intelligence and machine learning protocols. Currently, it appears that everyone is getting on the AI/ML bandwagon. With NVDA behind the wheel, it’s up, up, and away, right?Eh, maybe not. Certainly, I don’t want to get into any heated NVDA debates with ardent fans. However, just look at the performance. True, NVDA gained nearly 220% since the beginning of this year. However, in the trailing six-month period, this performance slips to 66%. And in the past 30 (calendar) days, it’s actually down – yeah, a shocker – 1%.So, if you want your NVDA holdings to be productive and simultaneously believe that shares have peaked, writing covered calls may make sense. Of course, one of the key risks is that if NVDA swings decisively higher, you may absorb an opportunity cost (because you’d be forced to fulfill the call option holder’s exercising of the contract).Overall, analysts project that NVDA will hit $647.04 over the next one-year period.Sempra (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSwitching strategies, utility giant Sempra (NYSE:SRE) may be an ideal candidate for options trades for a flat market. Here, cash-secured put selling may be appropriate, depending of course on your risk profile. With covered call writing, the core risk centers on the obligation to sell the underlying security. Again, that’s why you want to own the stock. If you engage in naked (i.e. uncovered) call writing, you may risk devastating financial pain.Now, let’s flip it around. If you really believe in a particular company – and most importantly have the cash if forced to buy it – then cash-secured calls give you a possible best-of-both-worlds scenario. If the target security never goes in the money, you collect the maximum premium. But if it does, you will simply buy your desired security at a price with which you’re comfortable.For Sempra, the beauty here is its natural monopoly. Frankly, no one’s going to oust it from its lofty position. And because Sempra serves much of the lucrative Southern California market, SRE should eventually recover even if it hits a downcycle.If you’re interested in income collection, the low-side analyst target for SRE is $78.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comFor all the political controversies that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk generates, it’s undeniable that TSLA represents a powerhouse. Of course, no one can guarantee which electric vehicle brand may survive 10 or 20 years from now. However, given the mass popularity and social integration of Tesla and other Musk ventures – much of which has been supported by government subsidies – TSLA may stand supreme.However, it’s not moving that much right now. Yes, shares gained 141% since the beginning of this year, an incredible performance. But in the past six months, this stat slips to a bit over 41%. In the trailing one-month period, TSLA gained a very pedestrian 3.6%. So, it’s possible – especially with rising consumer challenges – that Tesla could lose equity value.Still, as history demonstrates, TSLA tends to bounce back from such negativity. If you believe in the long-term potential of the EV maker, a cash-secured put could be enticing. Just be aware that you should truly pick a strike price with which you’re absolutely comfortable.To better gauge this comfort point, analysts project the low-side target to be $85.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs a discount retailer, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) could be an extremely intriguing idea for options trades for a flat market. Offering products with price targets mostly up to $5 – and few that rise to $25 – Five Below offers a little something for everyone. Let’s face it, even if you’re reasonably well off, inflation touches everything. So, we could all use a discount.With that core fundamental catalyst in mind, it’s possible that retail investors believe FIVE could swing higher. Unlike other discount retailers, Five Below hasn’t conspicuously sacrificed profitability for higher-volume sales. Its gross margin remains relatively robust, meaning that it’s well-positioned to handle an economic storm. Because of this framework, investors may want to buy FIVE.You on the other hand may believe in FIVE stock but not in its valuation. For instance, it trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23.95X, worse than 81.64% of its peers. Yikes! So, while you’re waiting for a more de-risked profile, why not collect some premiums? If you believe in this company, it could be a win-win no matter what happens.For those interested in a cash-secured put sale, the analyst low-side target sits at $175.Airbnb (ABNB)Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / ShutterstockFor temporary homestays and experiences marketplace provider Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), we’ll dive into a riskier options strategy called the iron condor. This advanced strategy involves selling an out-of-money (OTM) put and an OTM call. Simultaneously, you’re also buying a further OTM put and a further OTM call. These “outer” options represent risk hedging. Should the underlying security remain between the two “inner” strikes, you’ll realize a profit.To be clear, my discussion of the iron condor assumes that you’re symmetrically buying the same number of contracts for the inner and outer options. Otherwise, if your outer contracts are fewer than the inner, if the security moves against the trade to the upside, you may incur unlimited losses.What might make ABNB a candidate for advanced options trades for a flat market is that it hasn’t gone anywhere (on a net basis) since late June of this year. Initially, the enthusiasm for ongoing revenge travel sentiments lifted shares.

156,48c88c94-f40a-33a1-b8e4-b2597e1236e3,GE,2023-10-16,General Electric (NYSE:GE) shareholders have earned a 34% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-nyse-ge-shareholders-120022163.html,1697457622,STORY,['GE'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), which is up 88%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 15% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 108% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for General Electric While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, General Electric moved from a loss to profitability. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that General Electric has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on General Electric's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 3 years was 143%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that General Electric shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 108% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 8% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - General Electric has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Most stocks are flat or down, grumble analysts, noting that the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average recently turned negative on the year. If it weren’t for a catalyst in artificial intelligence (AI), the entire market might be in the red right now.While much of this is true, look a little closer and one can see several stocks that have racked up big gains so far in 2023.The broader market might be treading water, but several individual stocks have been soaring and outperforming. These are not the usual suspects. There are many lesser known, unheralded securities that are up 50%, 100%, or more this year. The gains in these names are being fueled by strong earnings, improving sentiment, and some surprising catalysts. Here are silent winners: seven overlooked stocks posting impressive gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMarathon Digital (MARA)Macro view of miner working for bitcoins mine pool. Devices and technology for mining cryptocurrency. Mining cryptocurrency concept. MARA stock. Crypto mining.Source: Yev_1234 / ShutterstockThe price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen nearly 70% this year. That has meant boom times for cryptocurrency miners such as Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA).The crypto miner just reported that it produced 1,242 Bitcoin in September, a 16% increase from August of this year and a 245% increase from September 2022 when the sector was in  the grips of a “crypto winter” and prices for digital coins and tokens were in freefall. The increased production comes as the price of BTC has remained buoyant despite a decline in stocks since August.Marathon Digital said it has now produced 8,610 Bitcoin this year and is searching for new mining locations that offer low-cost renewable energy that’s needed to mine for crypto. Owing to the increased activity and growth in cryptocurrency prices, MARA stock has gained 145% this year, nearly matching the increase in shares of Meta (NASDAQ:META).Over the last five years, Marathon Digital’s stock has increased 233%. While grossly under reported, crypto mining stocks are soaring this year.Story continuesDell Technologies (DELL)A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThere’s been a lot of talk this year about tech stocks, but almost no mention of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL). That seems strange given that the maker of laptops, monitors, and other computer hardware has been on a bull run.DELL stock is up 64% this year, has gained 95% over the last 12 months, and is up 150% since the company returned to the public markets five years ago after a hiatus. The rise in Dell Technologies’ share price is all the more impressive given that sales of personal computers globally have been in a funk for the past two years.DELL stock is currently trading near an all-time high. The company is benefitting from diversification and its moves into new areas beyond computer hardware such as cloud computing and data protection. Management is also focusing on the red hot area AI, mentioning the term “AI” nearly 20 times during its last earnings call with analysts and media. Dell has also posted better-than-expected financial results and raised guidance this year. DELL stock also pays a dividend of 37 cents a share per quarter, for a yield of 2.23%.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF)The front of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) location.Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.comAbercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is a retailer known for selling casual wear. However, ANF stock has been trading more like a tech start-up this year than a clothing retailer.Year-to-date, Abercrombie’s share price has risen 141%. The stock is up 268% over the last 12 months. Through five years, the shares have increased 200%. It’s a remarkable result that has trounced the performance of just about every other clothing retailer. The Gap’s (NYSE:GPS) stock is down 10% this year, for example.ANF stock began to skyrocket after a surprise profit was reported at the end of May this year. Abercrombie subsequently issued an earnings print at the end of August that obliterated Wall Street forecasts, announcing a profit of $1.10 a share when analysts had been looking for earnings of just 17 cents. Revenue also crushed consensus forecasts.The company also raised its outlook for the remainder of this year, saying it now expects sales to grow 10%, up from previous guidance of 2% growth. ANF stock is like a runaway train at this point.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAfter years in the wilderness, shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) have come roaring back. GE stock is up 66% in 2023, and has increased 117% in the past 12 months. The revival comes after the industrial giant successfully spun-off its healthcare unit in January. More changes are coming, with GE planning to spin-off its power generation business in early 2024. These change enable General Electric to focus more on its core businesses (which are also its most profitable) of aerospace and renewable energy.The breakup of its business is already having a positive impact on General Electric’s earnings. GE stock rose 6% after the company’s most recent financial results beat Wall Street forecasts across the board, and the company raised its full-year profit outlook. The company said it is benefitting from strong demand for its jet engine parts and airline maintenance work amid the current boom in air travel.Despite this year’s big run, GE stock looks attractively valued trading at 13 times future earnings.Fair Isaac (FICO)a pile of credit cardsSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.comFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is the credit scoring company that’s behind everybody’s FICO score, which measures consumer credit worthiness. Fair Isaac is the kind of company that provides an essential service in a niche market, giving it a near-monopoly position in the marketplace and a wide moat around its business. Some 95% of financial institutions in the U.S. are clients of Fair Isaac.With the economy in flux and interest rates at their highest level in 22-years, credit checks and FICO scores are being scrutinized now more than ever before, leading to boom times at Fair Isaac. This is reflected in FICO stock, which is up 50% this year, up 124% over the last 12 months, and up 330% over the past five years. The share price is currently near a 52-week high. The stock isn’t cheap, but its long-term outperformance and competitive position make it worth the expense.Carnival (CCL)Cruise ship Carnival Conquest docked at port Willemstad on sunset. Cruise stocks.Source: NAN728 / Shutterstock.comAfter being crushed during the pandemic, cruise line operator Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) is gaining ground again. CCL stock has risen 59% year to date, and is up 99% in the last 12 months. Other cruise operators such as Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) have seen similarly strong gains in their share prices this year. With the heights of the pandemic firmly in our rearview mirror and cruise bookings up sharply, Carnival’s earnings and its stock are once again moving higher. It’s welcome news after two very difficult years for the global cruise line industry.The company announced that it is seeing the highest demand for bookings in more than 50 years as people take to the high seas once again. CCL stock is also gaining traction from the fact that the company is making progress in terms of paying down its $30 billion debt load, the majority of which it incurred while its ships were idled during the Covid-19 crisis.The company just reported that its fiscal third quarter net income, or profit, topped $1 billion and its revenue hit an all-time high of $6.85 billion, both topping Wall Street forecasts.Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comHow about a microchip and semiconductor stock not named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? For that we turn to Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), a chip stock that has been performing well this year with little fanfare. Since January, MRVL stock has gained 50%, bringing its five year advance to 200%. The company, whose technology is used in areas such as computer, networking, security and storage, is seeing strong demand and earnings growth.Like most chip and semiconductor companies, Marvell also has a big opportunity in AI. So much so, that MRVL stock rose more than 30% at the end of May when management highlighted the company’s potential AI catalyst during an earnings call.More recently, the company beat Wall Street expectations with its quarterly print delivered at the end of August, reporting a profit of 33 cents a share on sales of $1.34 billion compared to 32 cents a share and sales of $1.33 billion that analysts had penciled in for the company.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in FICO and NVDA.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Valero Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.33 = US$15b ÷ (US$61b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 33%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 20% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Valero Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Valero Energy has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 200% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Valero Energy's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that Valero Energy has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the stock has returned a solid 71% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Valero Energy can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Valero Energy that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

However, just because an analyst has changed his or her rating on a stock from “buy” to “hold,” from “buy” to “sell” or from “hold” to “sell,” doesn’t mean you need to follow suit.Much like everyday investors get it wrong, and the so-called “smart money” institutional investors get it wrong, the sell-side analyst community can get it wrong sometimes as well.Here’s a good example. It’s not uncommon for analysts to place too much emphasis on a negative macro, industry, or company-specific factor. Either macro positives counter this or it winds up having a minimal effect.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat appears to be the situation here, with the following seven stocks. All of them have received analyst downgrades in the past week, but here’s why each one remains a buy.Adecoagro (AGRO)Cargo ship transporting goods. Maritime logistics. Logistics.Source: Travel mania / ShutterstockAdecoagro (NYSE:AGRO) is a large agro-industrial company in South America. A producer of grains, oilseeds, ethanol and dairy products, shares are up sharply (42.6%) year-to-date. Largely, due to strong results in recent quarters.However, after this strong run, analyst Daniel Sasson from Itau BBA has become a little cautious about AGRO stock. At least, that’s the takeaway, based on Sasson’s Oct. 2 downgrade of shares from “outperform” to “market perform.” Yet while another 42.6% run may not be in the cards over the coming year, I wouldn’t immediately dismiss the potential for Adecoagro to deliver outsized gains from here.Already trading at a discounted 6.5 times forward earnings, if the contrarian view on grain prices proves correct, and elevated prices for food commodities are here to stay, AGRO could re-rate to a higher valuation, as it becomes clear high profitability is here to stay as well.Emerson Electric (EMR)An office building with an Emerson Electric sign on it.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comOn Oct. 3, UBS’s Chris Snyder downgraded Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) from “buy” to “neutral.”Story continuesIn the analyst’s view, additional upside for the stock is limited because of the industrial technology company’s high exposure to the energy sector. Also, there’s uncertainty surrounding the impact on results of two recent large acquisitions.However, while one analyst has become less bullish on EMR stock, analysts at KeyBanc and Deutsche Bank have issued bullish ratings on shares recently. The Keybanc analyst (Ken Newman) cited favorable demand trends in his bullish initial rating on Emerson Electric.The Deutsche Bank analysts believe the market undervalued shares compared to peers and the company should beat expectations in its quarterly results this month.Taking both arguments into account, if you currently hold EMR, you may want to let it ride. These reasons to buy may outweigh Snyder’s “on the fence” view on shares.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, it has not been analyst downgrades that have hammered NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) shares lately.Yes, one sell-side firm (Keybanc) recently downgraded shares in this Florida-based utilities company from “overweight” to “sector weight.”However, this NEE stock downgrade has been in response to two negative developments.First, is the prospect of interest rates staying “higher for longer.” Second, is NextEra’s walking back of expectations for its NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP) renewable energy subsidiary.Nevertheless, if you’ve been waiting to make this former “green wave” darling a buy, now may be your chance to do so.Why? After falling 23.8% in the past month, NEE has dropped to a far more reasonable valuation (16 times forward earnings), with a solid dividend yield (3.72%) to boot.If interest rates come down next year, and today’s growth worries prove to be an overreaction, NextEra Energy could make a strong comeback.Norfolk Southern (NSC)Source: ShutterstockOn Oct. 2, BofA’s Ken Hoexter downgraded Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). The analyst cited recent data center outages (including one incident on Sep. 29) as a key reason behind his downgrade of the railroad stock from “buy” to “neutral.”This downgrade, plus the latest data center outage incident itself, have placed pressure on NSC stock. However, you may not want to see these developments as reasons to sell/avoid shares.While for certain, it’s possible that concerns about the data outages wouldn’t be so high, if not for the Norfolk Southern’s headline-making train derailment earlier this year.In short, Hoexter and the market right now may be overestimating the operational and reputational risks with the data center issue.As NSC trades at a discount to peers, and has already written off the likely derailment damages ($803 million), shares could be a buy after this latest round of weakness.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)The front of an O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) store.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is another one of the stocks that has received analyst downgrades over the past week, but shares in the auto parts retailer have also been one of the stocks receiving an analyst upgrade over the past week as well.Oppenheimer’s Brian Nagel downgraded ORLY stock on Oct. 6 (from “outperform” to “perform”) because of less favorable industry dynamics. The previous day Citi’s Steve Zaccone upgraded O’Reilly from “neutral” to “buy,” citing the stock’s appeal as a defensive retail stock.So, who is most likely on the money here? I’d opt to follow Zaccone’s take on ORLY shares. Zaccone makes a strong point that other factors (like market share gains/improved margins) may counter recessionary pressures.I’ve called out ORLY as being pricey in past coverage, yet I’ll admit these positives may enable the stock to maintain its premium valuation.Sandy Spring Bancorp (SASR)a person holding an iphone in one hand and a credit card in the othrSource: apichon_tee/ShutterStock.comGiven the challenges the regional banking industry is facing right now, it’s no surprise that Sandy Spring Bancorp (NASDAQ:SASR) has just received an analyst downgrade.On Oct. 2, DA Davidson’s Manuel Navas downgraded SASR stock from “buy” to “neutral,” due to the current interest rate outlook.In Nava’s view, “higher for longer” is bad news for Sandy Spring’s commercial real estate lending operations. Yet while interest rate headwinds are clearly in play here, as I argued last month, this may already be accounted-for in SASR’s valuation.How so? After plunging in price over the past year, this bank now trades at a 40% discount to book value.Following the current storms, and once interest rates head back lower, SASR could make a very strong recovery. While this smaller name may be riskier than many other downgrade stocks, upside potential may exceed this risk.Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) was downgraded on Oct. 5, making it another one of last week’s analyst downgrades.Interestingly enough, this downgrade was another new rating from Citi’s Steven Zaccone. Zaccone included the downgrade of this retailer alongside the above-mentioned upgrade of ORLY stock.Zaccone now rates TSCO stock at “neutral” rather than “buy,” following the latest store traffic channel checks.Yet while Zaccone may be right about O’Reilly, it’s possible his view on Tractor Supply is too pessimistic. With shares already sliding in recent months, the prospect of a consumer slowdown could already be priced-in.Shares today trade for around 20 times earnings. This valuation may be more-than-fair, given the potential for an earnings growth resurgence in 2024 and 2025.Tractor Supply is also appealing as a dividend growth stock. TSCO’s dividend payouts have increased by around 28.2% annually over the past five years.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

History suggests that cyclical factors can provide a catalyst for those stocks to outperform the market the following year. That laggards-to-leaders strategy establishes the premise for finding materials stocks to buy as 2023 ends.As of October 5, 2023, the materials sector was up about 0.6% for the year. That’s far below the S&amp;P 500, which is up about 11% for the year. And that’s even with the recent sell-off.One reason for the sector’s relatively lackluster performance is the breadth of this sector. It includes construction materials and steel, which are performing well this year. But it also includes metals and mining stocks that are affected by commodity prices and chemical stocks. All of these sectors have headwinds related to a slowing economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith many economists forecasting a recession in early 2024, the recovery may still be several quarters away. However, materials stocks will be among the first to recover. That’s why now may be a good time to consider starting a position in these materials stocks.Freeport-McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comMining stocks make up part of the materials sector, and Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) is one of the top mining stocks to consider for the coming quarters. The Phoenix, Arizona-based company is the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.That’s been a mixed blessing for FCX shareholders. Copper demand has not been as robust as expected, and the price of copper is down more than 6%. Not surprisingly, FCX stock is down by virtually the same percentage.However, in the company’s second-quarter earnings report in July 2023, Freeport McMoran’s chief executive officer (CEO) Richard Adkerson noted that global copper inventories remain low while demand remains strong.The takeaway is the same as it was earlier this year. Unless global governments retreat from their focus on renewable energy, copper demand will likely surge, and with it, the price of copper. That will allow investors to focus on the company’s strong balance sheet and outlook for earnings, which are expected to climb by 34% from $1.61 to $2.16 per share.Story continuesSouthern Copper (SCCO)Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockSouthern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) is another way to invest in the expected surge in copper demand. The company has over $89 million in copper reserves. This is largely due to its massive footprint in Peru, which holds about 13% of the world’s copper. In September, the company forecasted an increase in Peruvian copper production to 400,000 metric tons – a 17% year-over-year (YOY) increase.However, unlike Freeport-McMoran, SCCO stock is up 19% in 2023. But the stock is down 9% in the last month. This may explain why the stock has a consensus Sell rating despite projecting earnings growth of 22% in the next year. It didn’t help that the company missed on both the top and bottom lines in its most recent earnings report.Analysts may feel that all that growth is priced in. On the other hand, the miner does come with an attractive dividend that currently yields 5.58% and pays out $4 per share on an annual basis.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comThe last metal and mining stock on this list of materials stocks to buy is Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). The bullish case for Albemarle has to do with the expected growth in demand for lithium. Along with copper, lithium will be needed as a base metal for many of the most in-demand technologies, such as EV batteries and renewable energy storage.There are many ways for investors to invest in lithium. Albemarle is one of the safest if you want growth over time. Unlike copper, there are concerns that the world is facing an oversupply of lithium. That may be reflected in the ALB stock price, which is down 28% this year.On the other hand, Albemarle is forecasting a 17% drop in earnings from $25.90 to $21.48. That’s in contrast to analysts who have a consensus price of $257.86 for ALB stock, a 66.3% increase from its closing price on October 5, 2023.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comA company whose primary business is industrial gases is a logical choice to make a list of materials stocks to buy. However, that’s only part of the story behind Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD). The company generates over 3 billion cubic feet of hydrogen every day. That makes it one of the world’s leading producers of hydrogen.Of course, investors have been talking about the hydrogen revolution for several years. It would be easy to dismiss this moment as yet another example of when “this time is different” wasn’t different. However, the company continues building partnerships that suggest hydrogen demand will match the hype.Besides, that’s only one source of revenue for the company, which continues to beat earnings estimates year-over-year. And in the coming year, the company expects earnings to grow by 12%. That corresponds to the 14% increase in the APD stock price being forecast by analysts.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) presents investors with what may be a no-lose scenario. The company’s revenue and earnings increased sharply as demand for steel increased in 2020 and 2021. However, as demand normalizes, Nucor is finding it harder to meet revenue estimates. And the company is now forecasting that it may also start missing earnings projections.That suggests that investors may want to place more importance on the 7% decline in NUE stock in the last 30 days as opposed to the 18% increase in the stock so far in 2023. On the other hand, at the end of 2022, Nucor joined the exclusive ranks of Dividend Kings. This is marked by companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.That dividend currently pays $2.04 per share on an annual basis. That means that investors who bought the stock for growth may now want to hold the stock for the income it provides. And the company is also rewarding its shareholders with a $4 billion share repurchase plan.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comSherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) is North America’s largest paints and coatings manufacturer. The company blew away forecasts on the top and bottom line in its second-quarter earnings report in July 2023. However, that’s not reflected in the price of SHW stock, which is down nearly 2% in the last three months.But that highlights an attractive feature of the company’s stock. It’s a low-beta stock, which means it will generally drop less when stocks are under pressure. The company also offers investors with an attractive dividend.Of course, the stock may not have an impressive yield (it’s only 0.95%), but it’s grown the dividend an average of 19% over the last three years.Sherwin-Williams is also a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years. That combination of a low beta value and an attractive dividend makes Sherwin-Williams an easy pick as one of the more compelling materials stocks to buy.Bunge Limited (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comFor the last stock on this list of materials stocks to buy, I’m looking at the agriculture sector, and one of the leading names is Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG). The company is vertically integrated, with operations stretching from farmers to consumers.The company is one of the leading providers of agricultural commodities such as wheat and sugar. And in June, the company merged with Viterra, the agriculture division of Glencore. This will allow the company to capture more of the global agricultural demand and increase the company’s earnings outlook.That would be welcome news to shareholders. The company is projecting earnings to drop 4% in the next year. BG stock is down 8% in the last month after being up 18% in the last year.

It’s a pivotal discourse as Wall Street recently took a significant tumble, shedding light on the downside of a seemingly robust job market.As the S&amp;P 500 cascaded to a sobering four-month low, the focus is towards low-volatility strategies. The shifting focus embodies a pragmatic approach that seeks to navigate through the windstorms. Even while stocks have waned under the mighty pressure from climbing Treasury yields in the bond market, these low-volatility maneuvers were crafted to minimize losses during these market troughs while enabling opportunities for upside. With that said, let’s look at seven stable stocks that should help you ride out the market volatility with aplomb.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is effectively defying the gloom of the recession, sparkling as a stronghold in the retail sphere and emerging as a stable pick during economic downturns. The latest data gleams with optimism, revealing a promising landscape where factors including employment stability and disinflation are elegantly dancing with wage increases, sculpting a favorable environment for consumer behavior.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPeering into Walmart’s eCommerce and marketplace segments, a blossoming picture shows a robust 35% surge in advertising within the marketplace, a growing digital bazaar showing a staggering selection of approximately 400 million items. Moreover, the diligent stride of Walmart+, coupled with other membership initiatives, weaves a tapestry of personalized marketing and data, pivoting toward organic repeat customers.Investors might take comfort in knowing that the company’s earnings have comfortably beaten market expectations in the past four consecutive quarters. Thus, its metamorphosis into a beacon of reliability enables the firm to effectively stand as a historical and present reality, offering a semblance of stability.Story continuesPepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comNavigating the fickle terrains of the stock market, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stands tall, etching its mark as one of the most resilient stocks to consider in anticipation of a recession. Its robust financial positioning, diverse product spread, and insatiable appetite for innovation highlight its prowess to navigate and shine amidst recessionary clouds. The allure of PEP stock is undeniable, with it trading at a sensible 21.4 times Non-GAAP future earnings, boasting a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, translating to a generous yield above 3%.The crescendo of confidence reaches its peak with its second-quarter Non-GAAP EPS of $2.09 effortlessly overshadowing expectations by 13 cents. Revenues sizzle at $22.32 billion, surpassing forecasts by a whopping $590 million. Raising the performance bar, PepsiCo now projects an even brighter 2023, foreseeing a 10% organic revenue growth, a hike from its initial 8% outlook, and a 12% core constant currency EPS growth, marking a considerable leap from its prior 9% estimate.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comIn the vast digital cosmos, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to radiate brilliance with its unwavering growth and a vision set on the horizons of artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and other tech verticals.Furthermore, the company figures tell a compelling tale. With a stellar year-to-date return of 36.5%, the Redmond-based juggernaut unveils a sparkling fourth quarter report card which showed a net income vaulting up by 20% to touch $20.08 billion, and revenues clocking in at a robust $56.2 billion, marking an 8% year-over-year ascent. This performance not only trumps earnings expectations with a 5.6% surprise, but it paints the portrait of a company flourishing and evolving.The grand narrative is further enriched by Microsoft’s aggressive foray into AI, underscored by its hefty $10 billion plunge into OpenAI, the ingenious minds behind ChatGPT. This strategic alignment, mirrored in integrations from Bing to expansive applications, showcases a harmonious blend of technology, bridging domains from the vast cloud to the vibrant gaming arena. Additionally, Microsoft looks forward, setting its sights on a towering goal of amassing annual revenues of $500 billion by 2030’s end.American Water Works (AWK)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockAmidst the ebb and flow of economic tides, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) has established its position as a true bastion of reliability in the expansive public utilities space. This goliath provides critical water and wastewater services, catering to approximately 1,700 communities across 14 different states, reaching a vast user base of about 14 million.Furthermore, with rising earnings witnessed this year, evidenced by growth in both second quarter and first-half metrics, the price amplifications are effortlessly eclipsing escalating costs. Additionally, impressive net income and EBITDA margins glisten at 22% and 53% year-over-year, respectively, crafting a compelling financial narrative.Moreover, investing in it comes with a powerful dividend yield above 2.30% while boasting a 14-year history of dividend growth. Hence, AWK promises a voyage that is not only stable but remarkably prosperous for those who choose to embark upon it.U.S. Bancorp (USB)usbank (USB) logo on a bank during nighttimeSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.comU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has proven to be resilient and adept amidst the banking sector’s tumult. Despite having been embroiled in this year’s vortex of sectorial turbulence, regional banking stalwarts have navigated through incredibly well, witnessing a resilient rebound in customer deposits.Moreover, its savvy acquisition of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group‘s (NYSE:MUFG) Union Bank last December fortified its customer base with an additional 1.2 million customers along with a loan portfolio augmented by $58 billion and a substantial $90 billion in deposits. A major uplift in the CET1 capital ratio post-acquisition further accentuates the bank’s robust financial positioning, demonstrating a measured improvement in its capital adequacy and reinforcing its financial stability amidst the chaos. Additionally, USB stock does not merely whisper promises of stability but bellows a potent declaration with a compelling dividend yield of 6% and a venerable 12-year history of payout growth.Kimberly Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB) is a seasoned player in the consumer staples arena and has been resilient despite the economic headwinds. Recent quarters have unfolded a new chapter of recovery with a second-quarter gross margin bump of 34% while delivering another earnings beat. Additionally, its management envisages organic growth sprawling between 3% to 5% for 2023, with adjusted EPS growth growing by 10% to 14%.With an ‘A’ graded profitability profile, a sturdy year-over-year return on capital, and a net income margin of 20% and 8%, respectively, along with a vibrant $3.19 billion generated in cash operations, the company is crafting an enduring narrative. Hence, amidst the forest of investment options, Kimberly-Clark emerges as a venerable oak offering excellent stability.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comNavigating through the mining territories, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is a significant player in the copper industry, effectively bridging the gap between traditional mining and future-focused technological advancements. Extracting an impressive 4.2 billion pounds of copper last year, reflecting a nearly 10% uptick from 2021, FCX emphasizes the critical role of copper, highlighting its critical application in conductive materials. This positions the company to strategically capitalize on burgeoning U.S. infrastructure investments and a surging onshoring trend.Moreover, the anticipatory rise in electricity demand, propelled by the widespread infusion of AI, paints a favorable backdrop. While copper prices stand to gain from China’s economic stimulus endeavors, FCX’s future financial performances are likely to be heartening, with an EPS ascension to $2.12 in 2024 from $1.69 in 2023.Noteworthy is FCX’s pioneering integration of AI in mining; utilizing a machine-learning model to optimize production could usher in a new era of mining efficiency and profitability.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the latest clinical data in early- and late-stage cancers from its oncology pipeline will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023 from October 20 to 24 in Madrid, Spain. The presentations demonstrate the role of Libtayo® (cemiplimab) as both a monotherapy and a backbone of novel investigational combinations for various solid tumors.“Our data presentations at ESMO underscore Regeneron’s ability to apply a deep understanding of cancer biology, genetics and the immune system to advance the development of meaningful combinations for cancer types that have high unmet need,” said Israel Lowy, Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Oncology at Regeneron. “Notably, we are presenting the first survival data for neoadjuvant Libtayo therapy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and the first results for Libtayo in combination with ubamatamab, our investigational MUC16xCD3 bispecific antibody, in recurrent ovarian cancer. Beyond ESMO, we are excited by recent progress across our oncology portfolio, including FDA Fast Track Designation for fianlimab (LAG-3) plus Libtayo in melanoma. We look forward to sharing more with the global oncology community as we deliver on our promise to improve the lives of those impacted by cancer.”Among Regeneron’s ESMO presentations is an oral highlighting one-year survival outcomes, including event-free survival, from a Phase 2 trial of Libtayo in neoadjuvant CSCC. The primary analysis was shared at last year’s ESMO meeting.Story continuesRegeneron will also debut Phase 1 dose-escalation results for its investigational combination of Libtayo and ubamatamab in patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer in a poster session. A Phase 2 expansion portion of the study is underway. Ubamatamab is a CD3-targeting bispecific designed to bridge MUC16 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation.Additional presentations at ESMO include subgroup analyses of Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), focusing on such populations as squamous cell carcinoma and patients with varying levels of PD-L1 expression.Regeneron presentations at ESMO:Medicine Abstract title Abstract Lead AuthorPresentation date/time (all CEST)Skin cancer LibtayoA Phase 2 Study of Neoadjuvant Cemiplimab for Stage II to IV Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC): One-year Follow-up#1088MONeil D.

By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries, Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced CSCC and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer in the European Union (EU), Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Regeneron is responsible for the development and marketing of Libtayo globally. In the EU, Libtayo is currently marketed by Sanofi on Regeneron’s behalf over the course of a defined transition period.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Outside of the U.S., the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC) when your BCC cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) or when it has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with a HHI.Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:Libtayo may be used in combination with chemotherapy that contains a platinum medicine as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor does not have an abnormal “EGFR”, “ALK” or “ROS1” gene.Libtayo may be used alone as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"", AND your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

One time-tested strategy is to invest in high-quality dividend-paying stocks. Companies that consistently raise their dividends can provide much-needed income and downside protection when markets get choppy. Even better, reinvesting those dividends over the long-run can compound returns, and help investors achieve their financial goals.With valuations looking more reasonable after the market’s recent pullback, now could be an opportune time to rotate into these dividend payers. With the market potentially bottoming, investors can lock in higher yields before these stocks bounce back. Though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, these seven dividend stocks have been stalwarts through prior downturns, given their solid fundamentals.Energy Transfer (ET)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Energy Transfer (ET) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWith the disruption in energy markets due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, U.S. energy companies like Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) stand to benefit. Natural gas prices have surged globally, with disproportionate pressure on U.S. and Middle Eastern supply. Additionally, despite economic headwinds, oil prices have proven resilient thanks to production cuts from OPEC. Even if the war ended today, sanctions would likely remain, so I believe energy prices aren’t likely to decline anytime soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn particular, Energy Transfer’s natural gas pipelines and export facilities connect fast-growing supply basins like the Permian and Haynesville to demand centers along the Gulf Coast. With global competition for U.S. natural gas exports heating up, Energy Transfer’s infrastructure offers reliable takeaway capacity. For example, the recently-completed Gulf Run pipeline provides Haynesville gas an outlet to LNG export terminals. Meanwhile, Energy Transfer’s NGL pipelines and fractionators allow it to handle record volumes. Notably, the company’s Nederland export terminal exported over 30 million barrels of ethane in the first half of 2023 alone.Story continuesOn the crude oil front, the company’s acquisition of Lotus Midstream continues to pay dividends via commercial synergies. The partnership exported record amounts of crude in July 2023, utilizing Energy Transfer’s footprint. Looking ahead, Energy Transfer anticipates its capital run rate to average $2-3 billion annually over the long-term. Currently, the company’s cash flows support a targeted 3-5% annual distribution growth. The distribution was recently increased to $1.24 per unit annualized. ET stock now yields 9.2% annually.AT&amp;T (T)a picture of cell towers during daytimeSource: ShutterstockAfter some missteps in content and media investments, telecom giant AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) appears to be back on track with its core connectivity offerings. Following its spinoff of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T has refocused on its wireless and fiber broadband businesses. Impressively, the company has added 8.3 million valuable postpaid phone subscribers over the past three years, closing the gap on industry leaders. AT&amp;T has also doubled its fiber broadband revenues since mid-2020, reflecting strong demand for its premium fiber service.At the same time the company is reducing its debt load and cost profile, AT&amp;T continues investing at record levels in both its 5G and fiber offerings. Its wireless network now provides 5G service to more than 290 million customers, including 175 million with speedy mid-band spectrum. These network upgrades support new services like fixed wireless internet access for rural areas. With consumers and businesses increasingly dependent on connectivity, AT&amp;T’s investments position it for sustainable growth.Meanwhile, T stock offers an attractive 7.7% dividend yield. With a simplified operating focus and progress on deleveraging, AT&amp;T appears poised to maintain its dividend streak. While past investors endured missteps in content, today’s investors can buy a focused telecom leader at an opportune valuation. AT&amp;T still has work ahead to improve its margins, but its essential communications services and renewed discipline make it a compelling turnaround story.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAs a major U.S. midstream company, Enterprise Products Partners stands to benefit from tight energy supply and demand. Events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underscore the essential nature of North American oil and gas. Enterprise Products‘ (NYSE:EPD) diversified footprint handles over 11.9 million barrels of liquids, and processes nearly billions of cubic feet of natural gas per day. Critically, its infrastructure connects fast-growing basins like the Permian to Gulf Coast refineries, petrochemical plants, and export facilities.With energy exports surging, Enterprise is rapidly expanding its footprint. For example, natural gas pipelines like Acadian now transport Haynesville gas to LNG terminals, while NGL exports out of Enterprise’s Marcus Hook terminal keep setting records. Meanwhile, new fractionators and pipeline capacity will support growing Permian production. These expansions utilize existing infrastructure to capture new opportunities.Underpinned by strong volumes and stable fees, Enterprise generates steady cash flow to support its distribution. The company has now delivered 26 consecutive years of distribution growth. The latest hike takes EPD stock’s yield to 7.4%. Accordingly, with a strong balance sheet and $4 billion liquidity, Enterprise appears poised to continue growing its distribution in a volatile energy market. Its integrated infrastructure remains critical for providing the link between supply and demand across North America.Hess Midstream (HESM)Pipelines in the desertSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.comMany energy stocks sport eye-popping dividends, but midstream operator Hess Midstream (NYSE:HESM) pursues a unique strategy – aggressive share buybacks. Since 2021, Hess Midstream has repurchased 18% of its stock, reducing its unit count and increasing its dividend per share by 33%. This combination of buybacks and growing payouts has delivered a standout total return. Hess Midstream’s leverage of 3.1-times the company’s EBITDA also remains comfortably below peers, enabling ongoing buybacks.Hess believes another 10-15% of shares can be repurchased through 2025, financed through forecasted cash flow growth. The company anticipates 10%+ annual EBITDA and cash flow growth based on accelerating Bakken shale output. Hess Midstream provides essential gathering, processing, terminal, and water services across the Bakken, underpinning its projected growth.With its parent expanding Bakken drilling, Hess Midstream’s gas processing volumes already rose 6% year-over-year in Q2 2023. Looking ahead, Hess forecasts its Bakken output will grow 10% annually through 2025. This outlook provides clear visibility into Hess Midstream’s projected double-digit cash flow growth. While Hess Midstream lacks a jaw-dropping dividend, its balanced approach of buybacks and payout hikes continues generating outsized total returns. The company’s dividend currently yields 8.45%.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comDuring the pandemic, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) saw its top- and bottom-lines surge as e-commerce and logistics demand exploded. And in my opinion, while the pandemic boom has faded, this global logistics leader still has plenty of runway for growth. The company put up solid Q2 results despite economic turbulence. Revenue declined 11% year-over-year, but 5.5% top-line growth and double-digit EPS growth is expected next year.Meanwhile, the company’s operating profit edged down too, but I expect it to recover as UPS adjusts its cost profile. Agility is key in uncertain times. Personally, I believe UPS boasts an unmatched integrated network, spanning domestic small packages, freight, logistics, and international. Who doesn’t love UPS?Though near-term consumer spending may fluctuate, UPS targets growing areas like healthcare logistics. The company is on track to generate $10 billion in healthcare revenue this year. UPS ia also expanding its Digital Access Program, which simplifies shipping for e-commerce platforms. In my view, UPS has the scale, infrastructure, and innovation to deliver growth for years to come.Additionally, UPS continues directing lots of cash to shareholders. The company returned $4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2023 through dividends and buybacks. The company now targets revenue at about $14 billion in 2023, supported by robust cash generation. The stock also pays a well-covered 4.2% dividend yield.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is the largest public North American railroad pure-play, providing integral infrastructure connecting farms, factories, ports, and more. I believe railroads like UNP receive too little fanfare, despite their indispensable role in our economy.In Q2, Union Pacific’s volumes fell 2% year-over-year amidst consumer spending shifts. Ongoing service improvements allowed Union Pacific to meet available demand, though margins faced pressure. Still, Union Pacific has returned more than $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of 2023. Notably, this cash cow has also hiked its dividend annually for 16 straight years, with UNP stock currently yielding 2.5%. While pandemic-era margins may moderate, I have high hopes for the stock over the long-run.In my view, Union Pacific offers investors a premier rail pure-play backed by strong dividend growth. Infrastructure investments and service improvements aim to drive efficiency, fluidity, and volume growth over time. Union Pacific’s wide moat business model should continue rewarding shareholders for decades to come.Tyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has faced turbulence recently, with profits squeezed by inflation, higher costs, and moderating demand. The stock now trades more than 45% below its 2021 highs. However, I believe much of the macro negativity is priced in at current levels. Plus, TSN stock still offers income investors an impressive 4% dividend yield.In Q3, Tyson’s chicken segment remained pressured by low commodity pricing and higher feed costs. However, Tyson is optimizing its footprint by closing six chicken plants this year, plus transitioning its antibiotic-free chicken brand to “no antibiotics ever.” In beef and pork, tight cattle and hog supply have weighed on spreads. However, Tyson’s prepared foods segment continues gaining shelf space and market share through beloved brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park.I’m putting this stock at the bottom of this list due to mixed feelings displayed by Wall Street analysts. However, I am very bullish on TSN stock over the long-run.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-130014459.html,1697374814,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock up by 5.8% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Cisco Systems'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:28% = US$13b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 28% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 9.5% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Cisco Systems' moderate 10% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 39% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CSCO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CSCO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Cisco Systems Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 55% (or a retention ratio of 45%) for Cisco Systems suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Cisco Systems is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Cisco Systems certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.
