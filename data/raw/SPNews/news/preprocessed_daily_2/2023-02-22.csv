This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance data provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.4%.Revenues are expected to be $615.68 million, down 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verisk?For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.40%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verisk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verisk would post earnings of $1.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verisk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more high growth dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy.High growth can have different definitions for different people.In this article, we define high growth stocks as stocks that analysts expect to increase their EPS by an average annual rate of 10% or more over the next 5 years.Because they are expected to grow faster than the average, more of a company's value is based on future results. If a company's growth rate slows more than expected, its value might decline, sometimes substantially depending on various factors. As a result, many growth stocks are riskier than blue chip stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Dividends and share buybacks are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders. In economic expansionary times, many profitable companies increase their dividends if their profits increase considerably. In recessionary times or more economic uncertain times, many company profits could decrease and many companies might decrease their dividends or suspend them all together.Generally, it is harder to find high growth dividend stocks than it is to find normal growth dividend stocks as many stocks that pay dividends are in more mature sectors. Many growth companies also use their profits to reinvest into their operations rather than pay a dividend.Nevertheless, some stocks that fit both criteria do exist although their dividend yields might not be as high as some other dividend stocks in many instances.In terms of their fundamentals, many high growth dividend stocks depend on how well the U.S. and economy does. If the U.S. economy doesn't do very well, the growth of high growth companies might not be as fast as expected.In terms of 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates further to ensure inflation has really peaked. Depending on how far the U.S. central bank raises interest rates, U.S. economic growth could slow or even contract.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty in the economy, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 stocks with competitive advantages that paid a dividend and that also had EPS Next 5 year ratios of over 10%.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.For those of you interested, also check out 10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy10.

If you want to see more high growth low dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy.Low dividend stocks are stocks that don't pay that much of a dividend.Many companies that are profitable and have excess capital pay a dividend as a way to return capital to shareholders. Although not always, those companies tend to pay their dividends every quarter. When times are good and profits rise, many dividend stocks increase their dividends. When times are uncertain or profits decline, many dividend stocks cut their dividends or suspend them all together.By having a low dividend, companies would have more capital to invest in growth operations or for M&amp;A than similar companies with higher dividends per share.High Growth CompaniesHigh growth companies have different definitions for different people. For this article, we define high growth as a company where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 10% over the next 5 years.What is considered high growth can vary depending on where the economy is in terms of the economic cycle.If the economy is in the expansionary phase, more companies might have higher expected average annual EPS growth rates of 10% or more over the next 5 years than if the economy is beginning to contract or if the economic growth is expected to slow considerably.If the economy is in its absolute trough, however, there is a chance that more companies can grow their earnings per share faster as the base EPS would be an easier comparable to expand upon.Where the economy is in the current economic cycle is uncertain.The U.S. economy currently is fairly strong as unemployment is low and the economy is still expanding. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates considerably and the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates even further this year. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too much, many economists think there could be an economic slowdown or even a recession.Story continuesAs such, there is arguably more uncertainty over the future than there is normally as what the Federal Reserve does depends on decision makers and economic data. Given the market is uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diverisified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Taina Sohlman / Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 stocks with competitive advantages that had an EPS Next 5 year ratios of over 10% and dividend yields of less than 1.5%.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Since it is an estimate, the EPS Next 5 Year Ratio can change from time to time depending on economic developments, company specific developments, and analyst views.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy10.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.8%.Revenues are expected to be $350 million, down 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 33.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Talos Energy?For Talos Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Talos Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Talos Energy would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +134.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Talos Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Range Resources (RRC) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share for the quarter ended December 2022.

Volumes fell mainly due to lower demand, especially in European and American markets.Performance Products: Revenues fell 25% to $307 million courtesy of lower sales volumes resulting from weak demand for certain products, which were partially offset by higher average selling prices resulting from a rise in raw material costs.Advanced Materials: Revenues from the unit went down 12% to $278 million primarily due to lower sales volume resulting from weak demand prevailing in the industrial market and the deselection of lower margin businesses. These headwinds were offset by higher demand in the aerospace market, rise in average selling prices and improvement in the sales mix.FY22 ResultsEarnings for full-year 2022 were $2.27 per share compared with $4.72 a year ago.

They are successfully battling headwinds from worldwide logistics, geo-political issues and heightened raw material costs. These select Companies are instituting new operating efficiencies, cost-cutting strategies and planning expansion into higher growth markets.These stocks are diamonds in the rough attracting investors with higher dividends, improved multi-year fiscal performance and some are offering attractive share buyback programs.The pressure is on to grow crops more efficiently to feed everyone globally. The world’s population number is approaching eight billion this year. Farmers need to apply agricultural chemicals to fertilizers to improve crop yield and prevent phosphorus and nitrogen runoff and evaporation.The lingering war in Ukraine has disrupted the global food chain. But management of several agricultural chemical stocks predict the market will reassert itself within the next two harvest cycles. The result for investors is a jump in the global agricultural chemicals market to an estimated $292 billion by 2030, researchers Statista and Next Move Strategy Consulting say.As an undervalued stock industry, this sector is soaring with growth opportunities.Zacks: Agricultural Chemical Stocks Bank On Strategic MeasuresAmong the sector's most promising stocks for investors are Flexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF), Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE: NTR) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS). Analyst Zacks tells investors that some of the stocks in the Agricultural Chemicals sector are worth considering ‘for your portfolio’.Here are some notables:Zacks Sees FSI As Aggressive In Exploring For New Opportunities Flexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI) offers investors who are willing to take a little more risk within the agricultural chemicals sector a special opportunity. FSI is a developer and manufacturer of biodegradable polymers for oil extraction, detergent ingredients, and water treatment, as well as crop nutrient availability chemistry. Analyst Zacks sees it as a Company, particularly its NanoChem Division, as aggressive in exploring for new opportunities in applications such as detergent, water treatment, oil field extraction and agriculture to grow sales and net income.Story continuesFSI’s net profit was $3.4 million in 2021,16% higher than its $2.9 million in 2020. FSI stock is trading at a PE ratio (TTM) of 9.84.FSI’s volume expanded to $45.7 million in 2022 from $34.4 million in 2021, a 33% jump. In 2020, FSI’s volume was $31.4 million, 10% higher than the prior year.""Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, FSI feels like a great value stock right now,” concludes analyst firm Zacks. Investor Place lists FSI as one of its ‘hyper-growth stocks with 10x potential in 2023.” A Seeking Alpha analyst considers FSI stock a ‘buy,’ based on an analysis of multiples and growth over the past five years.Complete financial results for 2022 will be available on March 31, 2023 concurrent with SEC filings. A conference call will be held on the next business day, Monday, April 3, 2023.One of FSI’s goals is to feed the world’s growing population more efficiently. It is doing so profitably and reporting annual sales growth. It is a environmental technology company.The NanoChem Solutions, Inc. Division of FSI, with proprietary agricultural products EX-10, Sun Savr 30 and Sun 27, are specialty chemicals that successfully commercialize technology. They mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and evaporation. This means farmers can deliver more efficient production and improved crop yields.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Eyes ‘Strong Cash Generation’ In FutureCF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF) reported full year 2022 performance net earnings at $3.35 billion on net sales for the full year of $11.19 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.880 billion. In Q4, CF repurchased some 2.2 million of its shares for $223 million. Tony Will, president and CEO of the Company, said, at CF “We believe that the global nitrogen supply-demand balance and global energy cost structure will continue to present attractive margin opportunities for our cost-advantaged network.”As a result, Will predicted ‘strong cash generation’ in the years ahead and anticipates seeing strong demand for its low-carbon ammonia. He said ‘substantial capital’ would be returned to shareholders. Global nitrogen demand will remain high, he asserted, as the need to replenish stocks will mean continued high prices for corn, wheat and canola. Management estimates it will take two full years of harvests to fully replenish harvest grain stocks. In North America, Will forecasts positive farm economics in 2023. This includes strong crop futures prices and improving yields. In the spring of 2023, 91-93 million acres of corn will be planted, CF forecasts.At a PE ratio (TTM) of 5.03, CF is trading at what appears to be an undervalued level. According to an analysis by Zacks Equity Research, CF’s Q4 per share earnings rise of 33% beat its own Consensus Estimate even as CF’s reported sales lagged estimates, it said. However, share prices of CF rose 11.5% in the past year — compared to a 2.6% rise for the industry in this period.CF’s Board has approved a new $3 billion share repurchase program after the current buyback program is completed through 2025, the Company said. CF repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1.35 billion in 2022 and had at the end of 2022 some $150 million remaining for more buybacks through the end of this authorization period through 2024.NTR Sees 2023 Agricultural Fundamentals Remaining StrongNutrien Ltd. (NYSE: NTR) cited geopolitical supply disruption and market volatility across the agriculture, energy and fertilizer markets in reporting its full year 2022 performance results. It particularly noted the impact of the war in Ukraine constricting crop production. It reported net earnings of $7.7 billion on sales of $37.9 billion. Q4 2022 reached $1.1 billion net income on volume of $7.5 billion.Guidance for 2023 is in an EBITDA range of $8.4 billion-$10 billion with adjusted net earnings per share of $8.45-$10.65. The company said it is basing these guidance totals on its views that agricultural fundamentals remain strong in 2023 and will see the lowest grain stocks-to-use ratio in over 25 years. Further, NTR believes the Ukrainian crop production will continue to be constrained by the Ukraine war with Russia and will take more than one growing season to alleviate the supply risk from the market.Analyst Zacks Equity Research found that the Company’s Q4 2022 sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate as NTR “faced headwinds from lower sales volumes and higher cost inventory.” It noted that the Company successfully repurchased some 53 million shares in 2022 and has already bought back an additional eight million shares in 2023.With a market valuation of $38.9 billion, NTR is an opportunity trading at a PE ratio of (TTM) 5.31 today. Trading at $77 per share now, its 52-week high is $117.25.MOS Seen As a Great Dividend Stock The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) a producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop fertilizers for the global agriculture industry, has voted to increase it shareholder dividend yield to 1.6% in 2023. Dividends are seen as easily covered by Company earnings — making this a potentially bright dividend stock, according to SimplyWallStreet. “All of these things considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock,” Simply Wall Street concludes.MOS has set February 22 for its Q4 and full year 2022 announcement of fiscal results. Its earnings conference call is scheduled for February 23.Analyst Zacks sees MOS’ 8.4% gains over the past month as indicative of a possible 12.1% sales gain YOY fiscal performance. Zack awards MOS an ‘A’ for its stock trading at a discount to its peers.Simply Wall Street is encouraged that MOS has been growing its earnings per share at 63% a year over the past five years. This suggests to SWS that MOS is effectively and positively reinvesting in its business.MOS predicts 2023 will be a ‘strong year’ for nutrient application supported by healthy crop prices and grower economics. With a PE ratio stuck stubbornly under five at a (TTM) of only 4.86, MOS enjoys a market cap of $17.0 billion.In its 10Q SEC filing on November 2, 2022, MOS reported sales for its three months ended September 30 of $5.35 billion, a 56.5% increase from its $3.4 billion the comparable period the previous year. Net income attributable to Mosaic jumped to $841.7 million in the 2022 quarter from $371.9 million the previous year.The Company cited the war in Ukraine for a disruption of fertilizer and agricultural commodities that resulted in a rise in prices for its products. MOS said Chinese reductions in phosphate exports were impacting the global fertilizer market.CONCLUSION Agricultural Specialty Chemicals stocks are attracting investors, especially its undervalued stocks. They should be on every investor’s Watch List. Future predictions of a strengthening global market as well as share buyback programs and comparatively low PE ratios (TTM) are attractive. FSI in particular offers investors an early upside to participate in this sector by taking a little more risk. Investors should take a closer look at FSI’s outstanding performance. It is trading at a PE (TTM) ratio of less than ten. The company reported a 33% increase in sales for 2022. For full year 2021, it reported a 16% rise in profits on a 10% volume gain. For multiple years, FSI has generated continued increases in both volume and net profit. This is a Company that commercializes its specialty chemicals and offers proprietary and innovative polymer biodegradable additives for peak performance.Razorpitch Inc. is a marketing communications and investor relations firm serving private, pre-IPO, and public companies.

14,df6790f5-9e1d-36f7-9809-3f0a2d31ca0c,CF,2023-02-22,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-cf-140002472.html,1676988002,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $3.30 per share, indicating a change of -21.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.51 points to a change of -28% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.09 indicates a change of -43.3% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -12.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.1%. The $8.76 billion and $6.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.7% and -23.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.61 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.7%. EPS of $4.35 for the same period compares with $3.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.33%. The EPS surprise was +5.33%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.Stephanie Schiller WissinkThank you, and welcome to our Q4 Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today from Walmart's home office in Bentonville are CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. We'll follow a similar format to prior calls, where Doug and John David will share their thoughts on the quarter, year and year ahead. Following, we'll open the call to your questions. For the Q&amp;A portion, we've asked our segment CEOs to join, including John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International and Kath McLay from Sam's Club.Story continuesC. Douglas McMillonGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong finish to the year. And as our results in the last 2 quarters show, we acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year. We built momentum in the third quarter, and that continues. We're well positioned to start this fiscal year.John David RaineyThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to wrap up the year. We're pleased with how we finished the year. Our team demonstrated our agility and responsiveness to overcome the operational challenges, from supply chain disruptions, excess inventory and the shift in our merchandise mix.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.Oliver ChenGreat quarter. Would love your thoughts on consumer health and what you're seeing with respect to unit growth in terms of your guidance and your thoughts about how that may manifest.C. Douglas McMillonOliver, you did a great job working in like 6 questions, 5 questions? No. This is Doug. We'll try to make sure we cover all of those. You may have to remind us of 1 or 2.Kathryn J. McLayYes. I'll just say, as we went kind of through Q4, we were watching with interest to see how they behaved in home and apparel, GM, discretionary. We're happy to see high single-digit comp growth there. And we're watching, as we went through Super Bowl and Valentine, and we're still seeing kind of that hold. So yes, positive with where we're at, at the moment.John R. FurnerOliver, thanks for the question. First, I just want to say thanks to all of our associates for delivering a great quarter and everything they did last year. There are so many things that they went through collectively, and they just did a great job building momentum as the year went on.Judith McKennaYes. Maybe, Oliver, for International, it actually was a strong quarter, which ended a strong year for us with that top line and bottom line growth of around about 9%. That strength came out of a number of our markets. And you touched on Mexico and China, but India as well had a good year.John David RaineyOliver, this is John, David. I'll take the question on the initiatives. And one of the exciting things about this is actually how they all work together and importantly, not just working together, but how the investments that we're making in our supply chain helped to make this a profitable operation for us.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanOne theme of a question is the flywheel and the balance between investments and bottom line growth. The near-term question of the theme is the '24 outlook looks like it's burdened by some maybe fleeting items, LIFO in particular, some of the bottom line. So what's the right way to think about it? Are these good guys into '25 and/or the house money that you invest?C. Douglas McMillonSimeon, this is Doug. I'll kick it off and then John David can add.John David RaineySure. And I'll add, Simeon, that we do expect to see our return on investment improve marginally this year. That's what's in our plan. But that's really before we expect a sharper acceleration in the years to follow. And we'll give you more insight into that at our Investor Day, but we're very mindful that we need to show a return for these investments, but the good news is the early reads on some of the things that we're doing are really exciting and support that continued level of investment.C. Douglas McMillonI'd just quickly add. Our sales have been stronger these last few years. I mean, the 6% CAGR over the last 5 is a much higher number than you look -- than you would have experienced with the company previously. But then we had these unusual things happen with COVID costs and last year inflation and supply chain costs. And we're hoping for something that looks a little more normal going forward that would enable us to push through the strategy in a way that you see it in operating income growth.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Chris Horvers for JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversSo can you talk about how you're thinking about the Walmart U.S. comp guide of 2% to 2.5%? Inflation has barely ticked down in recent periods, it's still up double digits. Are you expecting grocery unit trends to deteriorate? Is gen merch still down this year? And ultimately, do you expect the U.S. business to go negative in the back half on a potential recession?John David RaineyChris, this is John David. I'll start and then turn it over to Kath and John for a little more color on their segments.John R. FurnerYes. And Chris, this is John. I'll just build on that. Certainly pleased to see some of the momentum in food and other categories, including unit growth in the last quarter. There was both traffic and basket expansion, which are both positive indicators.Kathryn J. McLayAnd if I just pick up on the Sam's growth. I think we've talked quite a bit about the 12 quarters of double-digit comp growth. But if you look underneath that strength and growth across traffic every single one of those quarters, across ticket, our membership income has grown solidly across those 12 quarters. We've grown in e-com. We're growing with Scan And&amp; Go. If I look at the actual membership composition, we're growing with mid- to high household income groups with share of wallet. We're growing with millennials and Gen Z as the largest growth area in our membership base. And then if I look at market share, we're growing market share in our club channel despite no opening clubs while our competitors were opening clubs.OperatorNext question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserOn this call, there's been a few different references to an algorithm to 6% top line growth compounded over the last few years to growing operating income faster than sales. Previously, we were under the expectation that Walmart was managing its business over the long term to a 4% top line growth and greater than 4% operating income growth. It's going to fall short of that this year. Is it still a realistic expectation that Walmart is managing the enterprise to that 4% top line, 4.5% -- better than 4.5% operating income growth number? And is it reasonable for that to kick in as early as next year?John David RaineyMichael, this is John David. Yes is the short answer. It's absolutely realistic to assume that. But when we put out multiyear targets, they're not designed or not intended to suggest that we can hit that in any economic environment, in any year. And so we're certainly -- our guidance this year reflects some of the pressures that we see broadly in economies around the world.C. Douglas McMillonOliver, this is Doug. I'll just second what John David said and then call out this last 5 years' performance again and say, 6% and 3%, 6% top line, 3% bottom line, is obviously not 4% and 4%. But we don't feel too bad about the 6%, and we just wish that, that 3 was a 6.1%, and we'd be in really good shape.John David RaineyIf I can just say one more thing, Michael, what we're fundamentally focused on is growing the absolute dollars of free cash flow each year. It's -- when we look at the composition of our business and how it's changing and the returns related to some of these initiative areas, it's just such that the financial architecture suggests that the operating income should outperform sales growth over the next several years. But fundamentally, we understand what creates value for shareholders, and we're focused on growing the absolute dollars of free cash flow.Michael LasserAnd just to clarify that, John David. To the extent that you do better, especially in the U.S. business this year, should your incremental margin on that upside be consistent or better than it's been historically, given you'll be lapping COVID costs, a lot of inventory disposition and other factors that shouldn't repeat this year?John David RaineyYes, it's a good call out. I appreciate the opportunity to address that. You're right. If you look, particularly for the U.S. business, the incremental margins will be higher year than what you typically see, and in large part for the reason that you mentioned. We're lapping -- like even in the last quarter, we lapped $500 million of COVID costs alone in that quarter. But when you look at it on a full year basis, that creates a tailwind in terms of incremental margins.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWe were just wondering, with regards to the promotional environment within grocery, are you still finding the promotional environment rational? Are there any areas that maybe aren't as solid as others? And I think you've alluded to this on the call today, but your view on the need for price investments in food going forward and the possibility of that being incorporated in your guidance for this year.John R. FurnerKate, it's John. Thanks for the question. First, I'd just anchor what we're doing in the purpose of the company is to help people save money and live better. So we're constantly thinking about making sure that our values are appropriate given what's going on in the relative marketplace.OperatorNext question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious if you could talk about what the net impact of Flipkart and PhonePe was on consolidated results this past year, and what your expectations are built in to guidance for the upcoming year. I'm also just curious what the plans are for that business and your ownership of those businesses?C. Douglas McMillonWe had a difficult time hearing you. The question was about Flipkart and PhonePe and is it reflected in our guidance for the year forward. That's all we got. Can you clarify a little bit more for us?Paul Lawrence LejuezSure. It was really about how much Flipkart and PhonePe contributed to results this (inaudible) upcoming year. Also the ownership of them, I guess, what are the plans there?John David RaineyPaul, this is John David. There is a little bit of a bad connection, so I'm going to attempt to answer this. And if we don't completely address your question, then we can follow up after the call.Judith McKennaMaybe just comment on the separation of the 2 businesses. So you have to remember, we've -- when we first invested into Flipkart, PhonePe had only just launched. It was 4 months old, and it had an annualized TPV as kind of like in the tens of millions of dollars. As that business has grown and as the Flipkart business has grown, whilst there are partnerships between the 2 commercially, actually, we recognize that each has been successful, and we're setting them up on a path for long-term success.John David RaineyAnd I believe the last part of your question related to share count assumptions for this year. Let me take the opportunity to just talk about capital allocation broadly in answering that question.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse.Karen Fiona ShortJust 2. First of all, I wanted to talk about the Walmart U.S. EBIT margin structure specifically within your guidance. Obviously, '22 or your fiscal '23 had its own separate challenges, and we know there is a LIFO headwind in fiscal '24. But I guess I want to talk a little bit about what the U.S. EBIT margin structure could be like going forward in fiscal '24 relative to pre-pandemic.John David RaineyI'll start, Karen. And it's good to speak with you. John may want to jump in. But I'll start with the first part of your question. So the EBIT structure related to the U.S. business, there's a couple of factors there. One is, if you look over the last 12 months, we had a mix shift in our business from GM to food and consumables of over 300 basis points. And we actually don't expect that to improve this year. In fact, we expect it to get a little bit worse, not by the same magnitude, but slightly worse. So that affects the margin structure.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.Robert Frederick OhmesMy question was just if we could get maybe a little more color maybe from Doug on Walmart+ and sort of how it's doing versus your -- more on how it's doing versus expectations. And what the customer is responding to for the new signups in Walmart+.C. Douglas McMillonRobbie, I'll go first. This is Doug. John is going to jump in here, too. I just say that the way that the business model is evolving, that includes 1P plus 3P, plus the services that go along with that, including advertising income, to us, make a ton of sense. They're mutually reinforcing. We're excited about the progress that we're making there. And Walmart+ is one ingredient of that.John R. FurnerYes, I think that's a great way, Doug, to describe it as an important part of what we're building. And it's a way that customers can access an interesting combination of all of our assets from our digital front end, which has become one experience over the last couple of years. The fact that we have inventory within 10 miles in 90% of the population is another way that this all comes together.OperatorNext question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhI was hoping to ask more on food inflation. As your team looks forward, what's your expectation for food inflation? And then I'm also curious on what you're seeing right now on the inflation front for non-foods.John R. FurnerAnd generally speaking, food inflation has been the most stubborn of all the categories. We were in mid-double digits in Q3 and Q4. Hasn't come down all that much. A little bit, I guess we could say, has come down the last couple of months, but it still would be a high level of disinflation at this point. So this looks to be a little bit higher than what we were expecting going into the year, but this all leads back to the comments earlier on uncertainty. We would have hoped and expected it have -- to have come back more than it has going into this year.C. Douglas McMillonThe way to think about it is dry grocery and consumables are stubborn mid-double digit, and those are going to just be with us for a while. And it will get a little confusing because you'll probably hear inflation numbers that start to sound lower, but you'll have to remember that's on a 2-year stack. So if inflation in dry grocery and consumables is only 3% or 5%, that's on top of 15%. And that's still a problem for the customer and still a pressure to their wallet.OperatorNext question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.Kelly Ann BaniaJust wanted to understand a little bit more some of the factors that were pressure or that were cycling from fiscal '23, including the pressures from markdowns, mix and supply chain. Wondering if you can just help us understand the magnitude of those pressures this year and what is baked into your guidance for fiscal '24.C. Douglas McMillonBefore these guys comment, I just want to quickly call out that we're profitable in food, and I don't want this to grow to the point where people think, ""Well, they make money in general merchandise. They don't in food."" There's a delta between all things, food, consumables, but there are some really profitable businesses in fresh and other areas. So we want to manage that mix, but I just don't want this to get too far out of balance.John R. FurnerAnd on the -- great point, Doug. And on the 300 basis point, that comment was related to last year, the shift -- the difference in mix between food and GM in the year that we just experienced. So we do think we'll have some mix impact going into this year, which we stated. But we don't -- we didn't say it was 300 for the year we're going into.John David RaineyYes. Kelly, this is John David. I'll add just a little bit more color. And maybe looking at the fourth quarter is a good way to frame this. Our gross profit declined a little over 100 basis points. I think it's 112 basis points in the fourth quarter. That was predominantly if you had to bucket that. The largest contributor to that was markdowns followed by mix.John R. FurnerYes. This is the time last year. Just to remind you, back in February, March last year, we were really getting caught up from ocean backlogs and receiving product that should have been onshore as much as 6 months prior to it being unloaded. And the cost, the markdowns, the impact and everything, from store labor to creating overtime, we expect some of those to be better.OperatorOur final question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.Gregory Scott MelichReally, I had a follow-up on the U.S. traffic trends and then on Sam's Club.John R. FurnerGreg, it's John. Yes, certainly, I would expect that there will be growth in traffic. That's what we've been seeing over the last several quarters, led by food and consumables. The growth of pickup and delivery and then e-commerce to home are also helping. So stronger results in e-commerce at its core and also stronger from the delivery business.Kathryn J. McLayYes. I'll just pick up from the Sam's perspective. I think last year, we had a couple of big acquisitions around Super Bowl and then around July 4. And I think the marketing of those as well as offering, with curbside and Scan And Go and convenience, meant that we're attracting a lot younger member base than what we've previously had. So I think we're really happy with the way the membership kind of composition is trending.Gregory Scott MelichIf I could, I'd love to follow up on the e-commerce part of the U.S. You talked about margin drivers with advertising, gave us some numbers there. Do we -- can you tell us what 3P is now as a percentage of that e-commerce business, or shipments, or any insight there?John R. FurnerThat is something we haven't disclosed. What we did say earlier, which is important, is the absolute number of items is now over 400 million. We have a really strong leader in the business who's building capabilities. And we know that their seller demand, sellers all across the market are looking for more ways to diversify their own business. So this is a great time for us to make the improvements we're making with things like sign up and the ability to list catalogs more easily, and that's led to the item and SKU count growth.OperatorAt this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.C. Douglas McMillonThank you all for your interest in the company. I think the 3 headlines are strong results, great team, bright future.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

Impressively, Sam’s Club comparable sales climbed by 8.3%, with the company exiting the quarter with memberships at an all-time high.And to top it off, the titan retailer’s global advertising business grew more than 21%, primarily driven by solid growth within Walmart Connect in the U.S.Doug McMillion, CEO, on the solid quarter, “We’re excited about our momentum.

Wal-Mart WMT and Home Depot HD have released their earnings today, while other big-box retailers like Lowe’s LOW and Target TGT, as well as store channels like Nordstrom JWN and Kohls KSS are expected to report in the next couple of weeks.Wal-Mart topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues but disappointed investors with dismal guidance. Wal-Mart offered a weak outlook for fiscal 2024. On the other hand, Home Depot topped the earnings estimate but missed on revenues. The retailer forecast a drop in profit this year and flat sales with last year as consumer spending declines amid persistent inflation pressures.Overall, the retail sector is expected to report an earnings decline of 32% on 5.1% revenue growth. The earnings season is coming to an end, with about 50% of the companies only from this sector yet to report. The traditional retail ETFs are thus in focus. SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF XRT and VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH gained 17.8% and 5.2%, respectively, so far this year.Most of the gains were driven by the rise in retail sales. This is especially true as retail sales increased the most in nearly two years in January after two straight monthly declines. Americans lifted purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, pointing to the economy's continued resilience despite higher borrowing costs (read: ETF Areas to Win on Upbeat January Retail Sales).What Our Model Unveils for Retailer EarningsAccording to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

And hey, in today’s volatile market, the relative safety and security that comes from owning utilities is not a bad idea.  But if you’re an investor looking for growth, you’ll be looking for more options. Right now, there are several interesting water stocks to consider. That’s because as you probably learned in school, only about 1% of the total water supply is drinkable. And some analysts predict that by 2025 as much as two-thirds of the world will face a shortage of freshwater.  Many of us don’t think much about water. But several geographies of the world, including areas right here in the United States, are dealing with multi-year droughts. In parts of Arizona, California, and Nevada, water levels are at historic lows. Accordingly, the federal government is threatening to cut water use by 25%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I’ll highlight seven clean water stocks that are using clean water technology to address this ongoing crisis. AWKAmerican Water Works$149.61WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15DHRDanaher$256.29PNRPentair$56.83CWCOConsolidated Water$15.30PRMWPrimo Water Corporation$16.33XYLXylem$107.29American Water Works (AWK) A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of clean water stocks is one of the largest water utilities in the country. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated monopoly. That means it doesn’t have competition in the areas it serves. However, in return, its prices are regulated. The company does business in 14 states and serves a total of more than 3 million customers. That’s a good predictor of future revenue and earnings, because its customers have to pay their utility bills.  And American Water Works isn’t standing still. The company plans to spend between $22 billion and $25 billion making strategic capital investments to continue to grow its business through acquisitions.  Story continuesInvestors certainly pay a premium to own AWK stock. Although the company’s current price-earnings ratio of around 20-times may seem attractive to some, it’s expensive relative to the broader market. That said, this higher multiple is somewhat offset by an attractive dividend which American Water Works has been increasing for the last 13 years, which is also supported by a sustainable payout ratio of around 36%.  Essential Utilities (WTRG) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is not a pure-play water stock. However, the company still supplies water and wastewater services to over 3 million customers across 14 states.  Essential Utilities is a diversified operation, and is also the parent company of Peoples Natural Gas. This has added volatility to the stock in recent years, with significant price volatility in 2021 turning into tailwinds in 2022 as the price of natural gas spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With natural gas prices expected to stay elevated for the next few years, this will be a bonus to shareholders considering WTRG stock for its diversified commodities exposure. Additionally, the company continues to showcase a strong balance sheet. Essential Utilities is trading at around 25-times earnings,which is a value compared to the sector average which is about 35-times earnings. Essential Utilities is also a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 31 years. Finally, the company’s current 2.5% dividend yield is supported by projected earnings growth of about 7% over the next five years. Danaher (DHR) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comDanaher (NYSE:DHR) makes this list of clean water stocks because one of the company’s revenue drivers comes from providing water testing equipment. And if Danaher is correct in citing that nearly 33% of the global population lacks access to clean drinking water, then its potential growth prospects may be even greater than current investors envision.  This water exposure also provides an even larger addressable market for the company. Currently, water testing equipment accounts for nearly 10% of the company’s revenue today. However, this percentage continues to climb both quarterly and year-over-year. For the next five years, the company’s revenue and earnings are both expected to climb somewhere in the high single digits. But if water testing becomes the revenue driver that the company expects, Danaher’s revenue may approach its historical 12% annual revenue growth level. DHR stock is down approximately 4.4% over the last 12 months which puts it in line with the S&amp;P 500. Danaher has a moderate buy rating and a price target of just over $300. That represents a gain of approximately 20% from the current stock price.  Pentair (PNR) In this photo illustration the Pentair (PNR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is next on this list of clean water stocks. The company provides exposure to many of the same business lines as other companies on this list, such as water treatment, energy-efficient water treatment, water systems, and pumps. However, the reason it makes this list is due to the way the company can help address the current issues with our global water supply. The company features a countertop water filtration system, the Pentair Countertop Drinking System, that can help reduce the need for plastic water bottles. In addition to providing filtered water from the tap, it’s expected this product will contribute to the growth of the growing circular economy.  PNR stock is up about 24% in 2023, and if the company continues its recent pattern of delivering higher year-over-year revenue and earnings, there may be more upside than the 6.5% consensus price target of analysts. Plus, Pentair is another dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 48 years.   Consolidated Water (CWCO) Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comI need to give credit to my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto who recently wrote about Consolidated Water (NYSE:CWCO). Much of what the company does is not distinguishable from other water utilities. However, the company is heavily involved in the process of desalination.  If 97% of the world’s water is salt water, then it stands to reason that companies involved in desalination will have a distinct advantage. And Consolidated already appears to have a first move advantage with the work its doing, and/or financing, in the Caribbean.  CWCO stock is a small-cap option in this space, which means it could be more volatile. That said, this stock has been around since 1995. Accordingly, investors have a decent track record to follow. In addition to being up 17% over the last year, analysts suggest the stock may have 30% more upside. And with projections of average earnings per share gains of 177% for the next five years, that may be a low estimate.  Primo Water Corporation (PRMW) Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to pure-play water stocks, it doesn’t get much purer than Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW). One of the company’s signature products is its exchangeable water tanks that are available at many big-box states.  PRMW stock is up just 9% over the last five years. But that’s to be expected, because the company has been going through a transformation. It sold off its coffee and tea business in 2020. And in 2021, Primo announced it was exiting the single-use bottled water business at retail locations in the United States. That will not only endear the company to the ESG crowd, but it will also boost the company’s bottom line.  Analysts expect Primo Water to grow earnings at an average of around 24% annually per year. The company is also expected to be one of the beneficiaries of the recently-passed Infrastructure Act.  Xylem (XYL)  A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comLast but not least on this list of clean water stocks is Xylem (NYSE:XYL). Xylem is a water technology company that manufactures a wide range of products “designed to ensure that water and wastewater treatment equipment keeps running at its best.”  For example, a common problem that Xylem can help address is leaky pipes. The average water main in the United States is likely to be over 50 years old. That means the company may well benefit from the Infrastructure Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2022.   XYL stock is up 17% in the last 12 months and is up 39.9% in the last five years. That’s pushing XYL stock up against analysts’ forecasts. The company’s consensus price target suggests the stock has about an 11% upside. However, Xylem also has a dividend that has been increasing for the last 12 years. Accordingly, considering the fact that Xylem is projected to post double digit earnings growth over the next five years, I think XYL stock is a solid long-term choice for patient investors. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares How Fast Is Huntington Bancshares Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Huntington Bancshares managed to grow EPS by 4.6% per year, over three years. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Huntington Bancshares' revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Huntington Bancshares maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 17% to US$7.0b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Huntington Bancshares' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Huntington Bancshares Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Huntington Bancshares has a market capitalisation of US$22b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$152m. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Huntington Bancshares but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Huntington Bancshares, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Huntington Bancshares offered total compensation worth US$9.6m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Should You Add Huntington Bancshares To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Huntington Bancshares is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Huntington Bancshares, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Even so, be aware that  Huntington Bancshares is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

28,7739e349-a7e5-3a09-b71f-caa73fcbfdbe,MGM,2023-02-22,‘Big Short’ Michael Burry Pours Money Into These 2 Stocks — Here’s Why They May Be Worth Buying,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-short-michael-burry-pours-150143646.html,1676991703,STORY,"['COHR', 'MGM']","[Michael Burry’s fame spread far and wide after his exploits were documented in the Big Short – the book - and later the movie - that told the story of Burry’s success in betting against the housing market during the financial crisis of 2008. That was a move that turned out to be a hugely profitable one.Burry went short then and hasn’t been shy in issuing repeated warnings on the current state of the market, either. In addition to some recent enigmatic tweets that hint at looming disaster, Burry has continually made bearish comments; stocks are in overvalued territory, high inflation is going nowhere and a ‘multi-year recession’ is coming, are just some of Burry’s arguments against growing optimism.Yet, all the doom and gloom talk hasn’t stopped him from leaning into the stocks he thinks can take on whatever bearish scenarios lie ahead.Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the details on two of his recent picks. Do the Street’s cadre of stock experts think these are also worth picking up right now? It looks like it; both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s check the details.Coherent Corp (COHR)The first Burry-backed stock we’ll look at is laser systems specialist Coherent. The company is a well-known name in the world of engineered materials and optoelectronic component systems, as a designer and maker of precision equipment. Although the company has fulfilled this niche since being founded back in 1971, what is relatively new here is the name and ticker. Previously known as II-VI, last July, the company acquired Coherent, and adopted its name. The new addition brought its own laser technology to the table, thereby increasing the company’s value proposition.The integration of the new addition appears to be going well, as was evident in the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (December quarter). Revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to a record $1.37 billion, meeting Street expectations, while organic revenue growth increased by 23%. The also company showed a backlog of $2.9 billion, amounting to a 68% year-over-year increase. On the bottom-line, adj. EPS of $0.95 beat the analysts’ call for $0.93.Story continuesAs for Burry’s involvement, he opened a new position during the quarter by purchasing 150,000 COHR shares. These are now worth about $6.7 million.Although the company warned of the potential adverse impact of macroeconomic conditions on some parts of the business during the second half of its fiscal year, Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein is undaunted and thinks investors are underestimating the potential here.“We exited the quarter with unchanged conviction as to significant upside potential for COHR’s long-term revenue growth and margin structure and thereby EPS and cash flow— significantly beyond investor expectations… Our long-term view remains unchanged based on our unchanged view as to strong secular demand trends across end markets and strong company-specific execution and as to investors’ underappreciation of COHR’s strategic vision and operational excellence,” the 5-star analyst wrote.These comments underpin Silverstein’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating and $87 price target. What’s in it for investors? Potential upside of a hefty 94% from current levels. (To watch Silverstein’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Silverstein’s stance; the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 11 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. The average price target stands at $56.25, suggesting the shares will move ~26% higher over the coming months. (See Coherent stock forecast)MGM Resorts (MGM)The next stock Burry is betting on offers something completely different. MGM Resorts is a global hospitality and entertainment company offering a wide array of services; these range from top-notch casinos and hotels to live and theatrical entertainment events to a host of nightlife and retail options. Its lineup includes some of the most known resort brands in the business, including Bellagio, MGM Grand, ARIA, and Park MGM, and in total, the company boasts 29 distinct hotels and destination gaming options in the United States and Macau.Of course, this is an industry that was hit hard during the pandemic but MGM’s bounce back has been impressive. In the recent Q4 report, the company generated $3.6 billion in revenues, representing an 18% year-over-year increase and bettering Street expectations of $3.35 billion. Making up the bulk of the sales, Las Vegas strip revenues reached $2.3 billion, amounting to a $500 million increase compared to the same period a year ago. The company showed a loss per share of $1.53, also trumping the Street’s forecast for EPS of -$1.57.The company said the outlook for 2023 looks bright and highlighted the ongoing recovery in Macau. During the quarter, MGM also repurchased shares worth $352 million, bringing the year’s total repurchases to $2.7 billion.Burry must have felt satisfied; during the fourth-quarter he opened a new position in MGM. He bought 100,000 shares, now worth north of $4.30 million.Singing MGM’s praises, Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon says the stock is a 'top pick in the space.'“With Vegas firing on all cylinders and Macau pent-up demand finally coming through, MGM delivered a strong 4Q beat with EBITDAR coming in 11% above consensus paired with positive forward commentary,” the analyst explained. “Given the strong Macau rebound, Vegas momentum and event calendar, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the space, we believe MGM is well-positioned to execute on capital returns as well as longer-term opportunities in Digital, New York and Japan.”As such, Beynon rates MGM shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $55 price target implies one-year share appreciation of ~27%. (To watch Benyon’s track record, click here)What does the rest of the Street have to say? As it turns out, other analysts are generally on the same page. 9 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $54.71, the average target is almost identical to Benyon’s objective.

You can skip our overview of Bill Miller and his investment philosophy and go directly to the 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Legendary Bill Miller.Bill Miller is the founder, current chairman, and chief investment officer of Miller Value Partners LLC. Miller has been in the investment industry for more than three decades and has earned a reputation as one of the most successful investors of all time.Bill Miller was born in 1950 in Laurinburg, North Carolina. He earned a degree in economics from Washington and Lee University in 1972 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1974. Miller received his CFA designation in 1986 and worked in the investment industry for more than a decade before starting his own investment management firm, Miller Value Partners LLC. The firm is based in Baltimore, Maryland, and as of Q4 2022, had a portfolio worth of over $1.5 billion.Miller Value Partners is known for its value-based investment philosophy, which is based on the principles of value investing popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. The firm believes that the stock market is inefficient and frequently misprices stocks, creating opportunities for astute investors to earn high returns.15 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Legendary Bill MillerIn an interview with CNBC in January 2023, Miller expressed indifference towards the ongoing volatility in the S&amp;P 500 and reiterated his theory about investment in undervalued stocks. He believes it is up to the individual where they see value in the stock market.He compared his investment approach with that of John Hamilton, who, back in 1939, created the Hamilton Drug Funds when Hitler invaded Poland. John borrowed $300 and made his broker purchase every stock on the New York stock exchange for a dollar or less. This went on to form the crux of the wealth he generated in the future from this trade. Many of the companies he invested in while standing on the mountain of bankruptcy fared well as an investment. This is largely similar to Bill Miller’s investment strategy, where he chooses to look for potential and the value a company can generate in the future rather than where it stands today.Story continuesRecently Miller remarked on his short trade on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). He pointed out that the company’s market cap of $380 billion (at the time of Miller's remarks), 7-fold higher than General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is not justified, given that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a car manufacturer instead of a technology firm. On the other hand, the legendary investor is bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and has holdings in both these companies.Our MethodologyFor this list, we have picked the top 15 holdings of Miller Value Partners as of Q4 2022.

Over the past several years, GM has taken the steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into a position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world.

What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-report-150003618.html,1676991603,STORY,['NCLH'],"[Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cruise operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.5 billion, up 207.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.41% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norwegian Cruise Line?For Norwegian Cruise Line, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Norwegian Cruise Line will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Norwegian Cruise Line would post a loss of $0.71 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.64, delivering a surprise of +9.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Norwegian Cruise Line doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, Planet Fitness (PLNT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +80.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $269.08 million, up 46.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Planet Fitness has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.39%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Planet Fitness will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Flows from Venezuela, Nigeria and the UK are also down.The common denominator among the losers is that they sell more of their crude via one-off sales in the spot market, making it easy for buyers to switch to other grades to take advantage of fluctuating prices. Shipments from Saudi Arabia, by contrast, which relies mainly on long-term contracts, have held up, the Kpler figures show.See also: Russian Oil Flows to China at Highest Since Ukraine Invasion“It’s the spot purchases that feel the damage first,” said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler.

This compares to earnings of $0.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.09, delivering a surprise of -62.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Flowserve , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, posted revenues of $1.04 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $919.46 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Flowserve shares have added about 17% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Flowserve?While Flowserve has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Flowserve: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

""Have an emergency plan in case you lose power and update your contact information on PG&amp;E's website so we can provide you with real-time updates on outages in your neighborhood.""Poised to respond to outages are PG&amp;E electric crews, troublemen, distribution line technicians and system inspectors who serve as the utility's first responders, along with personnel who will monitor electric incidents for public safety.In addition, PG&amp;E has opened its Emergency Operations Center and local operations emergency centers in impacted regions to more efficiently allocate crews, materials and other resources to restoration efforts. The company is using its storm outage prediction models that help determine the potential timing, location, and number of power outages. The models allow the company to have extra crews on standby to deploy to areas hard hit by the storm. PG&amp;E is also prestaging power poles, powerlines, transformers, and other electric equipment at yards throughout its service area to restore power to affected areas safely and as quickly as possible.Predictions for Incoming WeatherThis cold front is expected bring wind gusts of 40-55 mph along the coast and in portions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys with other areas seeing winds around 30-40 mph. Winds are forecasted to dissipate across the interior late tonight and Wednesday morning.Story continuesPrecipitation is forecasted for today as showers will accompany the winds in Humboldt and the Sierra Nevada crest. Snow levels will rapidly drop into Wednesday morning and may be as low as 500 feet, perhaps even reaching the ocean in localized spots in the north. In the Sierra, snow levels could be as low as 1,000-2,000 feet through Thursday before lifting slightly in the south on Friday.Snow accumulations late tonight into tomorrow morning in Humboldt will be significant. Snowfall will range from a coating in spots at sea level, increasing to 4-6 inches at 1,000 feet and up to a foot in the higher terrain of Humboldt north. This storm could bring snow loading on tree species not accustomed to snowfall, resulting in trees falling and branches breaking and impacting power lines.More significant moisture wraps around the storm system Thursday into Friday, focused on the north coast on Thursday and shifting to the interior and the south on Friday. Snow will continue in the southern Sierra on Saturday during the morning hours before exiting in the afternoon.A weak system may bring some rain and snow showers to the north on Sunday with another system pushing through the territory next Monday and Tuesday.Based on the current forecast, this storm won't have the same impact as the historic series of atmospheric river storms that hit Northern and Central California in late December and early January. In that storm, more than 7,200 PG&amp;E, contract and mutual-aid personnel were on duty, working to restore power to more than 2.8 million customers. More than 95% of those customers had their power restored in 24 hours or less.Keeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.Additionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.Storm Safety TipsNever touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action Center.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Microsoft said most of those users responded positively, but others found Bing was insulting them, professing its love or voicing other disturbing or bizarre language.Powered by some of the same technology behind the popular writing tool ChatGPT, built by Microsoft partner OpenAI, the new Bing is part of an emerging class of AI systems that have mastered human language and grammar after ingesting a huge trove of books and online writings. They can compose songs, recipes and emails on command, or concisely summarize concepts with information found across the internet. But they are also error-prone and unwieldy.Reports of Bing's odd behavior led Microsoft to look for a way to curtail Bing’s propensity to respond with strong emotional language to certain questions. It’s mostly done that by limiting the length and time of conversations with the chatbot, forcing users to start a fresh chat after several turns. But the upgraded Bing also now politely declines questions that it would have responded to just a week ago.“I’m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation,” it says when asked technical questions about how it works or the rules that guide it. “I’m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.”Microsoft said its new technology will also be integrated into its Skype messaging service.]"

The wildly popular chatbot from OpenAI, which can draft prose and answer search queries, has ""eye-watering"" computing costs of a couple or more cents per conversation, the startup's Chief Executive Sam Altman has said on Twitter.In an interview, Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy told Reuters that having an exchange with AI known as a large language model likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search, though fine-tuning will help reduce the expense quickly.Even withrevenue from potential chat-based search ads, the technology could chip into the bottom line of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet with several billion dollars of extra costs, analysts said. Its net income was nearly $60 billion in 2022.Morgan Stanley estimated that Google's 3.3 trillion search queries last year cost roughly a fifth of a cent each, a number that would increase depending on how much text AI must generate. Google, for instance, could face a $6-billion hike in expenses by 2024 if ChatGPT-like AI were to handle half the queries it receives with 50-word answers, analysts projected. Google is unlikely to need a chatbot to handle navigational searches for sites like Wikipedia.Others arrived at a similar bill in different ways. For instance, SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm focused on chip technology, said adding ChatGPT-style AI to search could cost Alphabet $3 billion, an amount limited by Google's in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, along with other optimizations.Story continuesWhat makes this form of AI pricier than conventional search is the computing power involved. Such AI depends on billions of dollars of chips, a cost that has to be spread out over their useful life of several years, analysts said. Electricity likewise adds costs and pressure to companies with carbon-footprint goals.The process of handling AI-powered search queries is known as ""inference,"" in which a ""neural network"" loosely modeled on the human brain's biology infers the answer to a question from prior training.In a traditional search, by contrast, Google's web crawlers have scanned the internet to compile an index of information. When a user types a query, Google serves up the most relevant answers stored in the index.Alphabet's Hennessy told Reuters, ""It's inference costs you have to drive down,"" calling that ""a couple year problem at worst.""Alphabet is facing pressure to take on the challenge despite the expense. Earlier this month, its rival Microsoft Corp held a high-profile event at its Redmond, Washington headquarters to show off plans to embed AI chat technology into its Bing search engine, with top executives taking aim at Google's search market share of 91%, by Similarweb's estimate.A day later, Alphabet talked about plans to improve its search engine, but a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard showed the system answering a question inaccurately, fomenting a stock slide that shaved $100 billion off its market value.Microsoft later drew scrutiny of its own when its AI reportedly made threats or professed love to test users, prompting the company to limit long chat sessions it said ""provoked"" unintended answers.Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has told analysts that the upside from gaining users and advertising revenue outweighed expenses as the new Bing rolls out to millions of consumers. ""That's incremental gross margin dollars for us, even at the cost to serve that we're discussing,"" she said.And another Google competitor, CEO of search engine You.com Richard Socher, said adding an AI chat experience as well as applications for charts, videos and other generative tech raised expenses between 30% and 50%. ""Technology gets cheaper at scale and over time,"" he said.A source close to Google cautioned it's early to pin down exactly how much chatbots might cost because efficiency and usage vary widely depending on the technology involved, and AI already powers products like search.Still, footing the bill is one of two main reasons why search and social media giants with billions of users have not rolled out an AI chatbot overnight, said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer.""One is accuracy, and the second is you have to scale this in the right way,"" he said.MAKING THE MATH WORKFor years, researchers at Alphabet and elsewhere have studied how to train and run large language models more cheaply.Bigger models require more chips for inference and therefore cost more. AI that dazzles consumers for its human-like authority has ballooned in size, reaching 175 billion so-called parameters, or different values that the algorithm takes into account, for the model OpenAI updated into ChatGPT. Cost also varies by the length of a user's query, as measured in ""tokens"" or pieces of words.One senior technology executive told Reuters that such AI remained cost-prohibitive to put in millions of consumers' hands.""These models are very expensive, and so the next level of invention is going to be reducing the cost of both training these models and inference so that we can use it in every application,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity.For now, computer scientists inside OpenAI have figured out how to optimize inference costs through complex code that makes chips run more efficiently, a person familiar with the effort said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately comment.A longer-term issue is how to shrink the number of parameters in an AI model 10 or even 100 times, without losing accuracy.""How you cull (parameters away) most effectively, that's still an open question,"" said Naveen Rao, who formerly ran Intel Corp's AI chip efforts and now works to lower AI computing costs through his startup MosaicML.In the meantime, some have considered charging for access, like OpenAI's $20 per month subscription for better ChatGPT service. Technology experts also said a workaround is applying smaller AI models to simpler tasks, which Alphabet is exploring.The company said this month a ""smaller model"" version of its massive LaMDA AI technology will power its chatbot Bard, requiring ""significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users.""Asked about chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Hennessy said at a conference called TechSurge last week that more focused models, rather than one system doing everything, would help ""tame the cost.""

Sydney, according to a user’s post, responded with comments like “You are either desperate or delusional.” In response to a query asking how to give feedback about its performance, the bot is said to have answered, “I do not learn or change from your feedback. I am perfect and superior.” Similar behavior was encountered by journalists interacting with the preview release this month.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is implementing OpenAI Inc.’s artificial intelligence tech — made famous by the ChatGPT bot launched late last year — in its web search engine and browser. The explosion in popularity of ChatGPT provided support for Microsoft’s plans to release the software to a wider testing group.“Sydney is an old code name for a chat feature based on earlier models that we began testing more than a year ago,” a Microsoft spokesperson said via email. “The insights we gathered as part of that have helped to inform our work with the new Bing preview. We continue to tune our techniques and are working on more advanced models to incorporate the learnings and feedback so that we can deliver the best user experience possible.”Read more: Microsoft’s AI Chatbot Finds Early Success in Bing SearchesThe company last week offered cautious optimism in its first self-assessment after a week of running the AI-enhanced Bing with testers from more than 169 countries.

SIG, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. TPH and Cumulus Media Inc. CMLS.4 Low P/CV Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio for Optimum ReturnsMarket pundits do not expect any drastic change in the economic scenario, at least in the first half of 2023. While the Fed's recent action to lower the magnitude of the rate hike came as a breather, worries about a slowing economy prevail. So, while you modify your portfolio to cope with the changing market scenario and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks, but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company's business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Signet Jewelers Ltd., Sterling Infrastructure, Inc., Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. and Cumulus Media Inc. boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.Story continuesA positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company's liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here’s the formula of P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Cumulus Media CMLS, Signet Jewelers SIG, Phillips 66 PSX, Tri Pointe Homes TPH and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Atlanta, Cumulus Media, is a radio broadcasting company.

64,69634249-b6aa-3a5f-959e-7664ae9406ae,WBA,2023-02-22,Here's Why Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Has A Meaningful Debt Burden,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-walgreens-boots-alliance-110031656.html,1677063631.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance How Much Debt Does Walgreens Boots Alliance Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Walgreens Boots Alliance had debt of US$11.7b at the end of November 2022, a reduction from US$13.9b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$4.23b in cash leading to net debt of about US$7.50b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Walgreens Boots Alliance's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Walgreens Boots Alliance had liabilities of US$28.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$40.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.23b as well as receivables valued at US$4.85b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$59.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit casts a shadow over the US$31.2b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. At the end of the day, Walgreens Boots Alliance would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Walgreens Boots Alliance's net debt is sitting at a very reasonable 2.0 times its EBITDA, while its EBIT covered its interest expense just 4.9 times last year. While these numbers do not alarm us, it's worth noting that the cost of the company's debt is having a real impact. Shareholders should be aware that Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT was down 53% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Walgreens Boots Alliance's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Walgreens Boots Alliance actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Our ViewOn the face of it, Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But on the bright side, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. Overall, it seems to us that Walgreens Boots Alliance's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. For this reason we're pretty cautious about the stock, and we think shareholders should keep a close eye on its liquidity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2%. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.06%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.32%.Coming into today, shares of the largest U.S. drugstore chain had gained 0.25% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 0.91%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.88%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Walgreens Boots Alliance as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Walgreens Boots Alliance to post earnings of $1.10 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 30.82%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $33.45 billion, down 0.92% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.50 per share and revenue of $134.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of -10.71% and +1.36%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Walgreens Boots Alliance.

66,e557327e-858d-3153-bed0-74accba68d27,WBA,2023-02-22,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-wba-140002461.html,1676988002.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share, indicating a change of -30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.83 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $134.51 billion and $139.9 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paychex ranked number five on the prestigious list for the second year in a row.

In 2022, Paychex seized the opportunity to invest in our employees with new learning and development programs that focused on the five dimensions of well-being as well as knowledge and skills-based learning designed to meet the needs of our workforce,"" said Karen McClendon, chief human resource officer at Paychex. ""This recognition by Training validates the culture of learning that we work so hard to cultivate at Paychex and the success of our extensive and innovative programs.""The Training APEX Awards ranking is determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, including demonstrated innovation and financial investment in employee development, the scope of development programs, and how closely such development efforts are linked to business goals and objectives. Winners demonstrate peak performance in employee training and development and organizational success.The training programs recognized as part of the company's overall successful learning and development program included the following:The Paychex Well-being Program: To support employee health and well-being, the Paychex training team developed a program that addressed environmental and cultural factors that influence the five dimensions of well-being: physical, emotional, financial, career, and community. The program included more than 80 company-wide Well-being Champions to support and coach, interactive activities, self-led resources, external seminars, internal events, and community service opportunities. As a result, an increase in the number of Paychex employees surveyed shared that the organization cared about their health and well-being from the previous year. Paychex also experienced a year-over-year decrease in the absence timeframe for the duration of short-term disability leave.The Strategic Consultant Academy: This six-week hybrid program was developed for new Client Advocates and Relationship Managers for the Paychex Professional Employer Organization (PEO) as an experiential learning program that combined a multitude of self-study learning resources, virtual instructor-led touchpoints, and shadowing with an assigned mentor. The goal was to drive consultative and strategic relationships with PEO clients to help grow their businesses-something measured by worksite employee growth. This program, in addition to other strategies, resulted in an increase in year-over-year growth of worksite employees with PEO clients.Refreshed New Hire Learning Program Content: This strategic initiative focused on the curation of the modules of the company's 20+ new hire training programs. 69 individual modules were reviewed and vetted for accuracy and relevancy and repurposed into four new eLearning modules called PAYX101: Paychex Foundations. The series was designed for any Paychex employee, regardless of role and averaged a review rating of 4.5 out of 5 from new employees that completed the program.Story continuesThe company is also committed to helping business owners succeed with employee training and development, offering a cloud-based learning management system (LMS) called Paychex Learning Essential and Paychex Learning Enhanced.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230221005753/en/Introducing Starbucks Oleato™ – a Revolutionary New Coffee Ritual (Photo: Business Wire)""During my first trip to Milan in 1983, I was captivated by the sense of community, connection, and passion for coffee I found in the city’s espresso bars. It was that trip that inspired me to bring the ritual of handcrafted espresso to Starbucks and to America. Oleato represents the next revolution in coffee that brings together an alchemy of nature’s finest ingredients – Starbucks arabica coffee beans and Partanna cold pressed extra virgin olive oil,"" said Howard Schultz, Starbucks interim chief executive officer. ""Today I feel just as inspired as I did 40 years ago, Oleato has opened our eyes to fresh new possibilities and a transformational way to enjoy our daily coffee,"" said Schultz.Story continuesStarbucks continuous search for inspiration revealed a family tradition that has existed in regions of Italy for generations - enjoying a spoonful of extra virgin olive oil each day as an uplifting ritual. This led Starbucks to Partanna, an Italian extra virgin olive oil brand with more than 100 years of tradition and dedication to farming and crafting premium extra virgin olive oil.Oleato, The New Coffee RitualPartanna created a highly curated blend of extra virgin olive oil from the finest Mediterranean olives, including the high-quality Nocellara del Belice (also called Castelvetrano) olives from Partanna, Sicily. The blend was thoughtfully selected to pair perfectly with Starbucks coffee, which is then skillfully infused in the beverage to unlock a smooth and delicious experience like no other.Starbucks Oleato beverages that will be served in Starbucks stores around the world:Oleato™ Caffè Latte: Starbucks Blonde Espresso Roast, a light roast that is smooth and subtly sweet, is infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil and steamed with creamy oatmilk to create a velvety smooth, deliciously lush latte.Oleato™ Golden Foam™ Cold Brew: The inviting aroma of lush Partanna extra virgin olive oil infused cold foam cascades slowly through the dark, smooth cold brew, creating a subtle sweetness in the beverage.Oleato™ Iced Shaken Espresso: This coffee-forward beverage offers layers of flavor sweetened with notes of hazelnuts, rich espresso and creamy oatmilk infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil.In select markets, customers will also be able to add a press – the equivalent to a spoonful – of Partanna extra virgin olive oil as a customization to select beverages. The press will then be infused (steamed, shaken, or blended) as a customization into select drinks such as espresso beverages and tea lattes. Golden Foam will also be available as a customization, which can be added as a delicious topping on both hot and cold beverages.Designed to pair perfectly with the exquisite Starbucks Reserve coffee, the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Milan today debuted five Starbucks Reserve Oleato beverages:Oleato™ Caffè Latte: Starbucks Reserve Espresso and creamy oatmilk infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil create a velvety, luscious latte.Oleato™ Iced Cortado: Starbucks Reserve Espresso, demerara syrup, and a dash of orange bitters and oatmilk is infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil. It is then served over ice and finished with an orange peel.Oleato™ Golden Foam™ Cold Brew: Starbucks Reserve Cold Brew is lightly sweetened with demerara syrup and finished with Partanna extra virgin olive oil infused cold foam, creating an inviting aroma and subtle sweetness.Oleato™ Deconstructed: An ode to the Italian tradition of combining olive oil with a squeeze of lemon. This beverage pairs Starbucks Reserve Espresso and Partanna extra virgin olive oil infused with a luxurious passionfruit cold foam.Oleato™ Golden Foam™ Espresso Martini: Starbucks Reserve Espresso, vodka and vanilla bean syrup topped with golden foam – a fusion of fior di latte (sweet cream) and Partanna extra virgin olive oil.""When creating the beverages, we were inspired by the rich history and origin stories of coffee and olive oil – two of nature’s most transcendent ingredients,"" said Amy Dilger, principal beverage developer for Starbucks. ""Infusing Starbucks coffee with olive oil yielded a velvety smooth, rich texture, with the buttery, round flavors imparted by the olive oil perfectly pairing with the soft, chocolatey notes of the coffee.""""One thing that’s special about Partanna’s olives is their uniquely nutty, slightly sweet flavors – think of that rich smoothness of a buttery caramel, it’s a natural complement to our coffee,"" said Dilger. ""Whether you enjoy Oleato hot or cold, you get this really luxurious, textural experience.""Read more about the inspiration and creation of these beverages here.Raising the Bar on Coffee InnovationItaly’s romance with coffee, food and connection has served as an inspiration for the Starbucks Experience since the company’s earliest days, influencing its coffee, food, and store designs, as well as its reverence for artistry.""The art of coffee craft, curation and creation remains core to Starbucks. Our aspiration to continue to be the world's leader in premium coffee – in both the art and the science – is as strong today as it was more than 50 years ago when Starbucks first opened its doors,"" said Schultz.

Price and EPS Surprise ADT Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseADT Inc. price-eps-surprise | ADT Inc. Quote Factors to NoteADT’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from strength in the Consumer and Small Business (CSB) segment due to higher average pricing, subscriber growth initiatives and improved customer retention. Reduced service cost from the Virtual Assistance program is expected to have driven the CSB segment’s margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter.An increase in the prices of products and services is expected to have aided the Commercial segment’s performance. However, high raw material, labor and fuel costs and supply chain delays might have hampered the unit’s performance.The Solar segment’s performance might have been affected by higher costs from lower install throughput.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ADT this time around.

CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise.The Fed, which raised interest rates by 25 basis points a few days ago, has vowed to continue with its interest rate hiking strategy to curb high inflationary pressure.  The latest report indicates that further rate hikes are necessary in this respect. Higher interest rates shoot up the cost of borrowing, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.Inflationary woes have primarily resulted in extreme market volatility. Despite the current turmoil and economic uncertainty, shunning equities is an absolute no-no for investors. So what's the way forward to reap handsome returns from one's portfolio even during the current uncertainty?One way to proceed in this scenario is by adhering to broker advice. By following this method, broker-friendly stocks like, Archer Daniels, Delek US Holdings,Beazer Homes USA,AmerisourceBergen and Avnet should be included in an investor's watchlist for healthy returns.Why is Broker Advice the Need of the Hour?As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to much-detailed information on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. Naturally, their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.Story continuesGiven this extensive know-how, brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing, equipped with thorough knowledge and a clear insight into the details pertaining to the investment world. Paying heed to such well-researched information is, therefore, logical for investors to avoid the unfortunate scenario of one's hard-earned money invested in stock markets going down the drain.Making the Most of Broker KnowhowThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a promising basket of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is considered in designing a winning portfolio of stocks. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company's top line, making the strategy extremely effective.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels: This Chicago, IL-based leading agricultural products player's leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials is a contributor to its momentum. ADM's focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a key driver.Archer Daniels' Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit are aiding results. ADM has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars, which are optimize, drive and growth, for a while. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 6.7% upward over the past 60 days. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Brentwood, TN-based Delek US Holdings is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

DK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is in excess of 100%.Beazer Homes: This Atlanta, GA-based homebuilder designs, builds and sells single-family homes.

BZH has seen an upward estimate revision of 2.9% for current-year earnings over the past 60 days. This depicts analysts' optimism about the company's prospects.AmerisourceBergen is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical services companies. It focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the company in the quarters to come.ABC has seen an upward estimate revision of 1.2% for current-year earnings over the past 60 days.

77,c9ffe05f-4208-35eb-9c95-c9e6e3682440,MNST,2023-02-22,Is Weakness In Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-monster-beverage-corporation-nasdaq-120635558.html,1677067595,STORY,['MNST'],"[With its stock down 2.6% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Monster Beverage's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Monster Beverage How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Monster Beverage is:18% = US$1.2b ÷ US$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Monster Beverage's Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, Monster Beverage seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Monster Beverage's moderate 11% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Monster Beverage's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MNST worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MNST is currently mispriced by the market.Is Monster Beverage Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that Monster Beverage doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Monster Beverage's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

Excluding a total 2023 adjustment of $0.16 per share and an unfavorable currency impact, at then-prevailing exchange rates, of $0.15 per share, this forecast represents a projected currency-neutral increase of 7% to 9% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98 in 2022, as outlined in the below table.Story continuesFull-Year2023Forecast2022GrowthReported Diluted EPS$6.09-$6.21$5.81AdjustmentsAmortization and impairment of intangibles0.160.15Costs associated with Swedish Match AB offer-0.06Swedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item-0.06Tax benefit associated with Swedish Match AB financing-(0.13)Charges related to the war in Ukraine-0.08Fair value adj. for equity security investments-(0.02)Tax Items-(0.03)Total Adjustments0.160.17Adjusted Diluted EPS$6.25-$6.37$5.98Less Currency(0.15)Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding currency$6.40-$6.52$5.987%-9%The assumptions underlying this forecast remain unchanged versus those communicated by PMI in its earnings release of February 9, 2023.Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.Forward-Looking &amp; Cautionary StatementsThe presentation, related discussion and this press release contain projections of future results and goals and other forward-looking statements, including statements regarding business plans and strategies. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of COVID-19 on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of December 31, 2022, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 17.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 32% of PMI’s total full-year 2022 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed’s tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Good Economic Data is Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.Story continuesThe fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed’s last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard’s sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said “I think there’s a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we’ll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.”Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConagra Brands Inc.

Smoke-free products and RRPs are generating strong revenues.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for the current year.

Driven by the solid results and continued momentum in the snacks business, management issued an impressive view for 2023.Mondelez International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Soros' investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns. Hungarian-born American investor George Soros is one of the world’s most celebrated hedge fund managers. He recently made the headlines for passing controversial remarks about Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the Munich Security Conference. However, the backlash he received from the audience did not hold any effect on his investments in India. In the fourth quarter of 2022, his hedge fund increased its position in an Indian startup, Freshworks, to over $33.3 million.Soros is mainly famous for making $1.1 billion in profits by betting on the British pound’s fall in 1992. Because of this stunt, he widely came to be known as ‘the man who broke the Bank of England’. As of February 2023, the billionaire’s real-time net worth came in at $6.7 billion.Soros Fund Management follows a global macro strategy, making bets on currency rates and other economic fluctuations. Soros studies the financial markets carefully as well as gauges the behaviors of market participants. Soros believes that the behavior of market participants is crucial in understanding the irregular and fluctuating nature of the market. Following these investment philosophies, his hedge fund managed to report positive returns over the years. The fund averaged an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. In 2020, his fund gained 23.2%, versus an average hedge fund return of 11.6% during the same year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.As of the close of Q4 2022, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio has a value of over $7.26 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in the previous quarter. Some of the hedge fund’s major holdings in Q4 included Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). However, in this article, we will focus on dividend stocks that billionaire George Soros owns.Story continues10 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros OwnsGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks in Soros Fund Management's portfolio, as of Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in the fund.Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $784,280  Dividend Yield as of February 21: 2.77% The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment bank that provides financial services to its consumers. Soros Fund Management started investing in the company during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $807,000. In Q4 2022, the hedge fund did not change its position in the company and owned stakes worth $784,280. The company made up 0.01% of the billionaire George Soros's portfolio. Other prominent holdings of the hedge fund include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).On January 17, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) declared a quarterly dividend of $2.50 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.77%, as of February 21.In February, Wells Fargo raised its price target on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) to $420 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the company's price-to-book ratio relative to its peers.At the end of Q4 2022, 74 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion. Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness were some of the company's most prominent stakeholders in Q4.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)9.

95,9b37187b-2f97-3ceb-a6b7-9c1092701116,SLB,2023-02-22,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-trending-stock-140002547.html,1676988002,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned -4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which Schlumberger falls in, has lost 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +76.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.02 points to a change of +38.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $7.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +26.6%. The $32.74 billion and $36.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.5% and +11.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.6%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was +2.9%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is American International Group (AIG). AIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 9.65, while its industry has an average P/E of 10.13. Over the past year, AIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.69 and as low as 7.98, with a median of 9.96.AIG is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.97. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AIG's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.11. Over the past 52 weeks, AIG's PEG has been as high as 1.47 and as low as 0.84, with a median of 1.03.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is AIG's P/B ratio of 1.14. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.07. AIG's P/B has been as high as 1.18 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.89, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AIG has a P/S ratio of 0.8. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.91.Investors could also keep in mind Axa (AXAHY), an Insurance - Multi line stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Axa is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 8.35 while its PEG ratio sits at 1.07. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 10.13 and average PEG ratio of 1.11.AXAHY's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.22 and as low as 6.47, with a median of 7.89. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.30, as low as 0.51, with a median of 1.05.Additionally, Axa has a P/B ratio of 1.25 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 3.07. For AXAHY, this valuation metric has been as high as 1.31, as low as 0.61, with a median of 0.95 over the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American International Group and Axa strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, AIG and AXAHY look like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, adjusted earnings declined 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.38 in the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and the new European Union medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP EPS was 92 cents, down 16.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.73 billion, up 4.1% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency and contribution from the company's fiscal first-quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT) and flat year over year on a reported basis. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.Third-quarter organic revenues, according to the company, reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience business, in international Diabetes markets and improved product availability across certain businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from ventilator sales, given the strong year-ago comparable due to COVID-19 severity, and sales in China, given volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes.Q3 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) were up 3% on a reported basis (up 2% on an organic basis) to $4.06 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.29 billion (30% of total revenues), down 6% on a reported basis (up 6% on an organic basis).Emerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.37 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 5% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 6.5% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 7.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from Structural Heart &amp; Aortic were up 8.8% at CER to $760 million. Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular revenues were up 1.5% at CER to $581 million.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.14 billion, down 1.6% year over year at CER. The company reported low-single-digit declines in both Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal. Excluding the unfavorable impact of ventilator sales, and sales in China, given the unfavorable impact of provincial VBP tenders, Medical Surgical revenues increased 3% organic.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.25 billion were up 8.5% year over year at CER, driven by a low-double-digit increase in Specialty Therapies and mid-single-digit increases in Neuromodulation and Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies, all organically.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $570 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenues declined in the mid-teens in Q3, offset by high-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-twenties growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by the high-teens growth of insulin pumps, mid-thirties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products on strong sales of the MiniMed 780G system and the associated increase in CGM attachment rates on the strength of the Guardian 4 sensor.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 312 basis points (bps) to 65.2% on a 5% fall in gross profit to $5.04 billion.Research and development expenses were up 2.9% year over year at $688 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 428 bps year over year to 22.5%.GuidanceMedtronic issued fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter guidance and updated its fiscal 2023 guidance.Fourth-quarter organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-5%. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of February, fourth-quarter revenues would be unfavorably affected by approximately $165 million to $215 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal Q4 worldwide revenues is pegged at $7.97 billion.The full-year adjusted EPS projection has been updated to the range of $5.28 to $5.30 (reflecting an increase in the lower end of the earlier-projected band of $5.25 to $5.30), including an estimated 21 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.26.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal third quarter. Barring the Medical Surgical group, the company reported year-over-year sales growth in each of its reporting segments organically. The company’s updated sales outlook for fiscal 2023 assumes considerable organic growth from the year-ago period’s levels, instilling optimism.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. The contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.8%.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) taking the charge in 2007. Since then, streaming channels and smart TV platforms have proliferated and put linear TV channels at risk of extinction. One of the pioneers of this streaming world has been Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU).Its streaming platform allows users to find and access a variety of TV shows, movies, news and sports programs. The company provides digital advertising and related services as well as content distribution services. Roku also manufactures, sells and licenses smart TVs under the Roku TV name. Other devices include streaming players, audio products and smart home products and accessories.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ROKU. Click here to check it out. ROKU 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ROKUPeter Lynch Chart of ROKUBy some measurements, Rokus market share is very high. In a recent survey, industry trade journal Cord Cutter News found that more than 70% of consumers who are dropping their cable or satellite service use a Roku device and stated, Roku is the clear leader in the world of cord cutting and is almost twice as popular as its next competitor.In terms of smart TV market share, the Roku operating system was the number one selling smart TV operating system in the U.S. The companys 38% share of units sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 was more than the next two largest TV OSs combined. Internationally, the Roku OS was the top-selling smart TV OS in Canada and in Mexico, where market share grew to 30% of units sold.Founded in 2002, the company currently has a market capitalization of $9.2 billion.Financial reviewRoku falls under the category of companies who have never made money, and may never make money, at least according to GAAP net profit standards. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported on Feb. 15 that platform revenue increased 5%, but device revenue declined 18%. The platform gross margin was a software-like margin at 55.8%, but the device gross margin was -32.1%. Loss from operations was $250 million and adjusted Ebitda was -$11.6 million. The levels of stock compensation are atrocious and came in at $104 million for the quarter, which represented 17% of operating expenses.Story continuesThe free cash flow story for the year was also not great as operating cash flow was $11.8 million, but capital expenditures were $161.7 million, creating a large burn rate for the year. Luckily, the balance sheet remains strong with almost $2 billion in cash and no long-term debt.Other metrics seem decent but somewhat meaningless unless the company can generate improved margins on improving metrics. For 2022, active accounts reached 70 million, which was a net increase of 9.9 million accounts from the prior year. Streaming hours increased by 14.3 billion hours to 87.4 billion for the year. Average revenue per user grew to $41.68, which was up 2% compared to the prior year. With operating expenses increasing 71% in the fourth quarter, one would think the ARPU growth would need to have increased significantly.ValuationThere are no positive GAAP earnings estimates for the foreseeable future and the company is even forecasting negative Ebitda for the first quarter of 2023. Price-to-revenue and relative valuations are the last refuge for investors trying to value money-losing companies. Roku sells at roughly 2.3 times 2023 revenue estimates. This compares to standalone streaming companies at 1.5 times, SaaS companies at 5.7 times and general media companies at 2.2 times revenue. The average of those three sectors is 3.1 times, which may make Roku undervalued on a relative basis. However, relative valuations are fraught with risks as in a market downturn, all stocks can go down, along with the relative valuation.The company pays no dividend and does not buy back shares.The average price target for Roku stock by 21 analysts that cover the company is $71.78. The highest price target is $90 and the lowest is $36.Guru tradesGurus that have purchased Roku stock or added to their positions include Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio) and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies. Investors who have sold out of or reduced their positions include Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio). SummaryRoku certainly has the pedigree and history to be a successful stock in the new streaming world, but still faces headwinds. A recession will negatively impact the advertising market and, therefore, affect a major revenue stream for the company. Ad-related views may also shift away from ad-supported content and move toward subscription only. Lastly, the competition among streaming channels and smart TV platforms is intense and does not seem to be abating.However, the company does have strong brand recognition and the continual launch of new Roku smarts TVs should help drive higher levels of subscriptions. The macro shift to digital advertising should also benefit the company.Nonetheless, the company needs to accelerate the efforts to generate free cash flow or the stock will likely be rangebound. That prospect is still several years away, so there is potential for more downside ahead for Roku's stock.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here’s the formula of P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Cumulus Media CMLS, Signet Jewelers SIG, Phillips 66 PSX, Tri Pointe Homes TPH and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Atlanta, Cumulus Media, is a radio broadcasting company.

110,69ff0520-13b3-33ff-a149-0ffaffc19480,PSX,2023-02-22,Dive Into DuPont Analysis & Pick These 5 Top Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dive-dupont-analysis-pick-5-122412637.html,1676982252,STORY,"['GWW', 'PSX', 'AB', 'DD']","[Return on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierThe screener yields winning stocks like W.W. Grainger GWW, Olympic Steel ZEUS, MasterCraft Boat MCFT, AllianceBernstein AB and Phillips 66 PSX.Why Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks. However, when looking for lower-priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen:W.W. Grainger: This Zacks Rank #1 company is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of GWW for the past four quarters is 9.81%.Olympic Steel: The Zacks Rank #1company is a leading U.S. metals service center focused on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate steel and aluminum products.The average earnings surprise of ZEUS for the past four quarters is 25.39%.MasterCraft Boat: The Zacks Rank #2 company designs, manufactures and markets recreational powerboats through its subsidiaries.The average earnings surprise of MCFT for the past four quarters is 15.15%.AllianceBernstein: The Zacks Rank #1 company provides diversified investment management services, primarily to pension funds, endowments, foreign financial institutions, and individual investors.The average earnings surprise of AB for the past four quarters is 10.32%.Phillips 66: The Zacks Rank #2 company operations incorporate refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals.The average earnings surprise of PSX for the past four quarters is 13.01%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Our eclectic, rapidly changing mix of gift giving assortments clearly resonated with consumers this holiday season. We saw fourth quarter U.S. comp store sales growth of 4%, well above our plan, and U.S. customer traffic increase. Marmaxx delivered a very strong 7% comp increase, its highest quarterly comp of the year, driven by excellent sales in its apparel and accessories categories.""Herrman continued, ""For the full year, total sales neared $50 billion, U.S. comp store sales were flat, and overall profitability improved. During the year, our apparel businesses, including accessories, across the Company were strong. Sales at our home businesses overall were softer as we saw extraordinary growth during the two prior years when consumers focused on purchases for their homes. At our international divisions, we saw total sales increases and improved profitability for the year. Fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start and we remain confident in improving our profitability this year and reaching our pretax profit margin target of 10.6% by Fiscal 2025. We are energized for the year ahead and our plans to keep bringing customers around the globe ever-changing selections of great fashions and brands at excellent values. Longer term, I am confident that we are on track to becoming an increasingly profitable $60 billion-plus company.""U.S. Comparable Store Sales (FY2023) and U.S. Open-Only Comparable Store Sales (FY2022)The Company’s U.S. comparable store sales by division in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 and full year Fiscal 2023, and U.S. open-only comparable store sales by division in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022 and full year Fiscal 2022 were as follows:Fourth QuarterFY2023U.S.ComparableStore Sales1Fourth QuarterFY2022U.S. Open-OnlyComparableStore Sales1,2Full YearFY2023U.S.ComparableStore Sales1Full YearFY2022U.S. Open-OnlyComparableStore Sales1,2Marmaxx3+7%+10%+3%+13%HomeGoods4-7%+22%-11%+32%Total U.S.5+4%+13%0%+17%1Comparable store sales exclude e-commerce sites (tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, homegoods.com, and sierra.com). 2This measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days they were open in the fourth quarter and full year of Fiscal 2022 against sales of those stores for the same days in Fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic. 3Combination of T.J.

Merchandise margin decreased slightly and includes an unplanned 0.6 percentage point shrink charge versus last year. The Company’s fourth quarter guidance had contemplated that shrink would be a 0.5 percentage point benefit to pretax profit margin versus the prior year.Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 was 26.1%, a 1.0 percentage point decrease versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 were 17.0%, a 1.0 percentage point decrease versus the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022.For the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company’s pretax profit margin was 9.3%, a 0.2 percentage point increase versus last year’s pretax profit margin of 9.1%. For the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company’s adjusted pretax profit margin was 9.7%, which excludes a 0.4 percentage point charge related to a write-down of the Company’s minority investment in Familia. This is a 0.1 percentage point increase versus the Company’s full year Fiscal 2022 adjusted pretax profit margin of 9.6%, which excluded a 0.5 percentage point debt extinguishment charge. Full year Fiscal 2023 pretax profit margin included an unplanned 0.3 percentage point shrink charge. The Company’s most recent full year Fiscal 2023 guidance had contemplated that shrink would be neutral to pretax profit margin versus the prior year.Gross profit margin for full year Fiscal 2023 was 27.6%, a 0.9 percentage point decrease versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs as a percent of sales for the full year Fiscal 2023 were 17.9%, a 0.8 percentage point decrease versus the prior year.Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange RatesChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates. Given the global operations of the Company, to facilitate comparability, the Company has provided sales growth and inventory on a constant currency basis, which assumes a constant exchange rate between periods for translation based on the rate in effect for the prior period.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a two percentage point negative impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.03 negative impact on fourth quarter Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share.The movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a two percentage point negative impact on the Company’s net sales growth in the full year Fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.06 negative impact on the full year Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share.A table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX’s pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of TJX.com.The foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as ""transactional foreign exchange.""InventoryTotal inventories as of January 28, 2023 were $5.8 billion, compared with $6.0 billion at the end of Fiscal 2022. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of January 28, 2023, including distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit, the Company’s e-commerce sites, and Sierra stores, were up 1% on a reported basis (with inventory on a constant currency basis up 2%, which reflects inventory adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as described above). The Company is well-positioned to take advantage of the outstanding availability of quality, branded merchandise in the marketplace and flow fresh merchandise to its stores and online this spring.Cash and Shareholder DistributionsFor the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company generated $3.0 billion of operating cash flow. For the full year Fiscal 2023, the Company generated $4.1 billion of operating cash flow and ended the year with $5.5 billion of cash.During the fourth quarter, the Company returned $791 million to shareholders. The Company repurchased a total of $450 million of TJX stock, retiring 5.7 million shares, and paid $341 million in shareholder dividends during the quarter. In Fiscal 2023, the Company returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders, which includes repurchasing a total of $2.25 billion of TJX stock, retiring 34.8 million shares, and paying $1.34 billion in shareholder dividends.With the Company’s continued strong cash flow, TJX announced today that it intends to increase the regular quarterly dividend on its common stock expected to be declared in March 2023 and payable in June 2023 to $.3325 per share, subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. This would represent a 13% increase over the current per share dividend.The Company is also announcing today its plan to repurchase approximately $2.0 to $2.5 billion of TJX stock during the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024. With $1.5 billion remaining at Fiscal 2023 year end under the Company’s existing stock repurchase program, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. The new authorization represents approximately 2.2% of the Company’s outstanding shares at current prices. The new stock repurchase program marks the 23rd program approved by the Board since 1997. Under the Company’s repurchase programs, share repurchases may be made from time to time in market or private transactions and may include derivative transactions. The repurchase program announced today has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.Divestiture of FamiliaDuring Fiscal 2023, the Company announced and completed the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $217.6 million in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, which negatively impacted first quarter Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $.19. Additionally, the Company realized a $54 million tax benefit in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, which increased third quarter Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $.05. The combination of the first quarter impairment charge and the related third quarter tax benefit negatively impacted full year Fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $.14.First Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 OutlookFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company is planning overall comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3%. For the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, the Company expects pretax profit margin to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $.68 to $.71.For the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company is planning overall comparable store sales to be up 2% to 3%. For the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, the Company expects pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.3% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.39 to $3.51. The Company’s full year guidance includes an expected pretax margin benefit of approximately 0.1 percentage points and a diluted earnings per share benefit of approximately $.10 due to the 53rd week in the Company’s Fiscal 2024 calendar. Excluding these expected benefits, the Company expects full year Fiscal 2024 adjusted pretax profit margin to be in the range of 10.0% to 10.2% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.29 to $3.41.Stores by ConceptDuring the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, the Company increased its store count by 146 stores to a total of 4,835 stores and increased square footage by 3% over the prior year.Store Locations1Gross Square Feet2FY2023FY2023(in millions)BeginningEndBeginningEndIn the U.S.:T.J.

While stores in the U.S. were open for all of Fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in TJX Canada and TJX International (Europe and Australia) experienced COVID-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during Fiscal 2022. Therefore, the Company cannot measure year-over-year comparable store sales with Fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. As a result, the comparable stores included in the Fiscal 2023 measure consist of U.S. stores only, which, for clarity, the Company refers to as U.S. comparable store sales and are calculated against sales for the comparable periods in Fiscal 2022.About The TJX Companies, Inc.The TJX Companies, Inc. is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.

Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted to exclude or include, as applicable from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), items identified in this press release. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release include adjusted diluted earnings per share, total U.S. net sales, sales growth on a constant currency basis, inventory on a constant currency basis, and adjusted pretax profit margin. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted financial results is useful to investors as it provides additional information on comparisons between periods by excluding certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for business planning purposes, to consider underlying trends of its business, and in measuring its performance relative to others in the market, and believes presenting these measures also provides information to investors and others for understanding and evaluating trends in the Company’s operating results or measuring performance in the same manner as the Company’s management. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures.Important Information at WebsiteArchived versions of the Company’s conference calls are available in the Investors section of TJX.com after they are no longer available by telephone, as are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures and other financial information.

The Company repurchased and retired 5.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.5 billion on a ""trade date"" basis and paid $0.3 billion in shareholder dividends. During the twelve months ended January 28, 2023, the Company returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders. The Company repurchased and retired 34.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $2.3 billion on a ""trade date"" basis and paid $1.3 billion in shareholder dividends. In February 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time, with $1.5 billion still remaining as of January 28, 2023 under the existing stock repurchase program. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases.During fiscal 2023, the Company announced and completed the divestiture of its minority investment in Familia. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $218 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which negatively impacted first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share by $0.19. Additionally, the Company realized a $54 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 in connection with the completion of this divestiture, which increased third quarter fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $0.05. The combination of the first quarter impairment charge and the related third quarter tax benefit negatively impacted full year fiscal 2023 diluted earnings per share by $0.14.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230221005887/en/ContactsThe TJX Companies, Inc.Debra McConnellGlobal Communications(508) 390-2323]"

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, February 22, 2023Today's newsletter is by Jared Blikre, a reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter @SPYJared. Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The major U.S. indices had their worst day of 2023 on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC), closing down more than 6% from its early-February high. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury rates jumped to five-month highs with Federal Reserve hawkishness in focus.U.S. equities — particular tech stocks — are quickly weakening against a backdrop of interest rates that are once again surging higher. We've seen this play out several times since stocks peaked over a year ago when interest rate volatility in the bond market gave way to stock market volatility (meaning stocks sell off).The difference in 2023 — as we've been writing — is that growth stocks (like the unloved tech stocks) had once again been leading the way after taking a back seat to cyclical and value stocks throughout 2022.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The chart above shows that many of the worst-performing stocks from 2022 are this year's winners. Last year's duds caught Wall Street flat-footed and short this year — mounting a vicious rip-your-face-off rally.Tesla (TSLA) is up 60% in 2023 after shedding three quarters of its value from its November 2021 high. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) are each holding onto gains of 40% or more this year.The result is that Investors who were massively underwater on tech names coming into the year were given a tantalizing reminder of the fast and furious gains made in the space in years prior.Will the rally continue?Things have moved so rapidly and into such unchartered territory over this business cycle that massive disagreements have emerged among investors looking at different things — each through their own lens.Story continuesTechnical traders can point to charts of global indices and large U.S. sectors breaking out to new highs (as they've been doing since late-2022).Macro investors may chalk off the 2023 rally as junk-led, YOLO-redux and point to a potential hard landing that's now simply been delayed.Central bank and shadow banking buffs who track liquidity can point to the virtual flood of yen and yuan being ""printed"" by the Japanese and Chinese central banks this year — so big that it potentially offsets the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening.Finally, economists — after months of debating a hard versus soft landing — can point to a metaphor-destroying, ""no landing"" non sequitur.Some of these theories are mutually compatible given the differing timeframes. But as the dust settles on Wednesday's rout, it's important to remember that low-quality stocks with bad balance sheets and cash flow are unlikely to lead meaningfully again — even if the major indices resume their rallies.Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro USA, pointed out in a note to clients that looking inside the Russell 3000 — a broad measure of small, mid, and large-cap U.S. stocks — 44 of the 50 best-performing stocks this year didn't generate any profits over the past 12 months.""That’s strange, considering that higher bond yields should entice investors to focus on profits and cash flows,"" she says, noting the cognitive dissonance.Cox urges investors to tread carefully but not to run for the hills.""When rates are high, it’s smart to focus on what’s making money now while keeping your guard up with hedges and a defensive lean,"" she says, adding, ""Long-term investors may have an argument to take on some risk here, but they need to focus on quality companies, even if those quality companies fall into growth categories.""What to Watch TodayEconomy7:00 a.m. ET: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 17 (-7.7% during prior week)2:00 p.m. ET: FOMC Meeting Minutes, Feb. 1EarningsAllbirds (BIRD), Altice USA (ATUS), Baidu (BIDU), Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI), Bumble (BMBL), Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), eBay (EBAY), Etsy (ETSY), Fidelity National (FNF), Lemonade (LMND), Lucid Group (LCID), Marriott Vacations (VAC), Overstock.com (OSTK), Rent-A-Center (RCII), Teladoc (TDOC), TJX (TJX), United Therapeutics (UTHR), Wingstop (WING), Wolverine World Wide (WWW)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Target will report on February 28th, whereas The TJX Companies will report on February 22nd, both before the market open.How do the companies stack up heading into their releases? We can use results from another retailer, Walmart WMT, as a small gauge. Let’s take a closer look.Walmart Q4 Walmart posted better-than-expected results, reporting earnings of $1.71 per share and growing a strong 12% year-over-year.Quarterly revenue totaled $164 billion, again exceeding our consensus estimate of $159.7 billion and climbing 7.3% year-over-year.There were several notable highlights within the release, including –Walmart U.S. comparable sales climbed 8.3% year-over-year, and eCommerce witnessed 17% growth while the company continued to gain market share in grocery.In addition, Walmart International net sales tallied $27.6 billion, growing a solid 2.1% year-over-year. Impressively, Sam’s Club comparable sales climbed by 8.3%, with the company exiting the quarter with memberships at an all-time high.And to top it off, the titan retailer’s global advertising business grew more than 21%, primarily driven by solid growth within Walmart Connect in the U.S.Doug McMillion, CEO, on the solid quarter, “We’re excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong quarter to finish the year, and as our results in the last two quarters show, they acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year. We built momentum in the third quarter and that continues. We are well-positioned to start this fiscal year.”Now, onto TGT and TJX.Story continuesTargetQuarterly Estimates –A singular analyst has lowered their outlook for the quarter to be reported, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.39 indicating a pullback of roughly 55% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOur consensus revenue estimate sits at $30.7 billion, suggesting a negative change of 1% from the year-ago quarter.

For this timeframe, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of roughly 7.6%, on average. Newmont posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.9% in the last reported quarter. The company’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect higher production on improved grades across a number of mines. Improved gold prices and lower costs are also likely to have aided its performance. The stock has lost 32.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 10.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Newmont this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Newmont is +11.41%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at 42 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Newmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter consolidated revenues for Newmont is currently pegged at $2,921 million, which calls for a decline of around 13.9% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter average realized prices of gold stands at $1,781, suggesting a 5.3% rise on a sequential comparison basis. The same for the attributable gold production is pegged at 1.72 million ounces, indicating a 15.7% sequential rise.Some Factors to Watch ForImproved production performance is expected to have supported the company’s fourth-quarter results. In South America, the Merian mine is likely to have delivered higher production on improved mill performance and higher ore grade. Cerro Negro is expected to continue to have delivered improved productivity.The company is also likely to have witnessed higher production at Nevada Gold Mines in the fourth quarter on the back of higher grades. In Canada, Musselwhite is expected to have delivered improved productivity and grades. In Australia, performance at the Boddington mine is likely to have been aided by higher ore grades in the to-be-reported quarter. Strong production in Ahafo, driven by improved mining rates and higher ore grade, is also expected to have driven results in the company’s Africa operation in the December quarter.Newmont is also expected to have benefited from its actions to boost productivity and control costs in the fourth quarter. Benefits of lower unit costs are likely to reflect on its performance.Meanwhile, gold prices regained ground in the fourth quarter after remaining under pressure in the second and third quarter. Prices crossed the $1,700 an ounce mark in November as the Fed meeting that month signaled a likelihood of a slowdown of rate hikes.Story continuesGold prices also broke above the $1,800 per ounce level in December as signs of cooling U.S. inflation raised expectations of a less aggressive policy stance by the Federal Reserve. Prices of the yellow metal were up around 10% in the fourth quarter.Improved gold prices are expected to have supported Newmont’s performance in the December quarter.Newmont Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNewmont Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNewmont Corporation price-eps-surprise | Newmont Corporation Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider, as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Quaker Chemical Corporation KWR, slated to release earnings on Feb 23, has an Earnings ESP of +7.38%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Quaker Chemical’s fourth-quarter earnings is currently pegged at $1.22.

The consensus mark for CE’s Acetyl Chain (AC) segment is $1,123 million, down 11.9% on a sequential basis.Some Factors to WatchCelanese is expected to have gained from stable demand in end markets in the United States for its AC segment. However, a decline in volumes due to a fall in seasonal demand, consumer de-stocking and weak demand in Europe and Asia and certain end markets are expected to have put a dent in its EM and AC segment.Also, CE is expected to have witnessed an improvement in acetic acid pricing on a sequential basis. The AT segment is likely to have been hurt by cost inflation, which is expected to have been mitigated by a rise in volumes and improved pricing. Also, CE might have faced headwinds from raw materials, energy and logistic cost inflation in the fourth quarter. Higher costs are expected to have been a drag on its fourth-quarter margins.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Celanese this season.

My name is Shamali, and I am your event operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to today's conference, Public Service Enterprise Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 21, 2023, and will be available for replay as an audio webcast on PSEG's Investor Relations website at investor.pseg.com.Carlotta N. ChanThank you, Shamali. Welcome to PSEG's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Presentation. Joining us on the call today are Ralph LaRossa, Chair President and CEO of PSEG; and Dan Cregg, Executive Vice President and CFO.Story continuesRalph A. LaRossaThank you, Carlotta, and thank you to everyone joining us on our call this morning. Since the third quarter 2022 earnings report, we have had several important updates. Dan will provide you with a full financial review later in our prepared remarks as I will focus on some of the strategic highlights. We are pleased to report strong operating and financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. We successfully navigated last year's challenges, including inflation, supply chain disruptions energy price spikes and the steep rise in interest rates to deliver GAAP earnings of $2.06 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $3.47 per share, placing our results for the full year above the midpoint of our 2022 non-GAAP earnings guidance.Daniel J. CreggThank you, Ralph. Good morning, everybody. For the full year 2022, GAAP earnings were $2.06 per share compared to a GAAP loss of $1.29 per share for the full year of 2021, which included Fossil sale-related impairments. Non-GAAP results were $3.47 per share for 2022 compared to 2021's non-GAAP results of $3.65 per share which you may recall excluded depreciation related to the Fossil assets held for sale in the fourth quarter of '21 and retirement of power debt.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Constantine LednevIt's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to start off with the '23 guidance updates and specifically on the utility. Do you have any updates on the O&amp;M cost initiative targets and interest costs that are embedded in guidance versus what was presented in November, especially as you're binding down some of the collateral needs? And just maybe to clarify, was the pension outcome the main driver for the $50 million decrease at the top end of the guidance?Daniel J. CreggI think the way to think about the tension, honestly, is it's just reducing volatility overall. As we think about at EEI, it was in November, we were providing guidance. And as you know, we snapped the tape at 12/31. And so I think the elimination of the ups and downs of that could have come from year-end, which was not known at the time, was part of the reason that we had a wider range at that point and are more narrow now. I would say that, that number came in right about where we thought it was going to. And so I would say we are consistent with that, but with the absence of the movement that we could have had. We had pursued at that time, Constantine, that we would obtain what we did subsequently obtained from the BPU. So that was presumed already.Ralph A. LaRossaConstantine, the only thing I would add from an O&amp;M standpoint, we, we've been a culture of continuous improvement, and we'll continue to look for opportunities when they arise, but we don't normally publicize any specific numbers on that -- in that area.Constantine LednevOkay. This one might be more for Dan again. With the announced exit from offshore wind and the first part being that put option on the JV and the potential incremental acreage sales more directly, how are you thinking about the use of proceeds? And as we think about the old investment capacity slide, and with the sale proceeds, the unwind of the short-term financing, is there a target FFO to debt metrics that we need to think about in your longer-term planning assumptions?Daniel J. CreggYes. I think the -- we settle along that, that exit from Ocean Wind 1 would be at our cost to date. And we've characterized it as being right around $200 million, just in excess of $200 million. So that -- it certainly is nice to have back, but it's not a major item to move the needle with respect to the broader numbers. I think we've talked about having an overall FFO debt threshold, 13% to 14%, and we've talked in the past about living somewhere north of that into the 15%, 16% area. And I think that's a fair way to continue to think about where we are.Constantine LednevGreat. And maybe for just 1 second shifting to nuclear. What's the threshold for including operational or CapEx driven outside into the plan and the needs associated with it. Just thinking of the co-owner and some of the assets of just being -- the announcements around some of the uprates elsewhere? Just curious on any thoughts or conversations that you've had?Daniel J. CreggYes. If -- so we'll have our normal run rate operating capital. But to the extent that there is an opportunity to deploy capital to enhance results overall. Obviously, that analysis is going to go through just like any other analysis we would do and be up against the hurdle rate that's going to show that's going to make sense for us to do that. I think we have some promise on some things going forward. And maybe we'll give you a little bit more color about that as we get a little further down the road on that.Constantine LednevAnd any specific conversations that you've had or still too early?Ralph A. LaRossaAbout the CapEx?Constantine LednevWith the co-owners.Ralph A. LaRossaWe talked to our co-owners all the time. I mean, that's just a normal operating, but nothing specific. Yes. So I would say no.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandIt's actually Rich Sunderland on for Jeremy. Circle back to the offshore wind update. Just on the (inaudible) acreage, any options you're evaluating beyond an outright sale here? Also curious what we could expect the next update on this front.Ralph A. LaRossaYes. No. So Rich, Just unequivocally, we are not going to be in the offshore generation business. I mean -- and the timing of what we do, we'll just be keeping an eye on the market and see what makes sense.Richard Wallace SunderlandVery clear. Got it. And then just Governor Murphy's executive orders within that, I guess, the 100% clean energy plan. How do you see this impacting the Energy Master Plan overall? I'm curious at a high level what you're focused on, either from that front or from an EMP front?Ralph A. LaRossaSo I would kind of say there's a lot of good news in that in that announcement last week for a company like ours and especially one that's been focused, we kicked off this effort on the last mile last year. And I think this just kind of reinforces the need for it from a customer standpoint and from a reliability standpoint. So lots of opportunities, and we'll certainly be engaged in that. I personally am tripling down on electric vehicles as much as we can in this area and that driving the decarbonization in the state.Richard Wallace SunderlandGot it. Very helpful. And sorry, I just wanted to circle back one last time to offshore wind. The (inaudible) acreage, is that all uncommitted? And can you just run the numbers on what's in there and what's net to PEG?Ralph A. LaRossaDo you want to take it? It's like 35,000 acres. And so there's about 35,000 acres that are still available. To some degree, we've committed some of that to Orsted if they go ahead with Skipjack I don't have the exact numbers in front of us, but it's a de minimis amount of that 35,000.Daniel J. CreggYes. There's -- as that project was going forward, there was a need for some incremental acreage. And so some of those were made available for that purpose. .OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust on the pension front, just -- I just want to reconcile and make sure we have this accurately captured. The accounting order from the BPU last week, that roughly mitigates about 20% to 30% of the pension expense volatility. So if you can confirm that, Dan, if that's still the right number. And then maybe you can update us on the sort of the lift-out approach that you had highlighted you were considering? Just any updates that you can share there as well.Daniel J. CreggDurgesh, on the first question, I think that's a reasonable way to think about it, although you will see, as you step through time, some of the components of tension will change. So it's not a -- I think it's a fair way to think about where we sit today, but as we step through time, some of that could move as some of the component elements end up changing. I think with respect to the lift out, we've talked about it a little bit in the past. We are continuing to explore that as a potential. Again, as a reminder, really, what that does is just shrink the overall size of the pension for us.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroLet's see. I was curious on nuclear. So one of your peers recently announced higher levels of nuclear O&amp;M heading into 2023. Curious if you would expect a similar dynamic in terms of upward O&amp;M pressure on your nuclear units. And then separate but somewhat related on nuclear fuel. They also -- we're taking a more conservative approach in terms of building inventory and lowering risk of any kind of Russian supply interruptions that could occur in the future. Wondering if you have considered a similar strategic approach in terms of sourcing nuclear fuel.Ralph A. LaRossaYes. So a couple of things on that front. On the -- just from an O&amp;M standpoint, as you recall, the Inflation Reduction Act required anyone who wanted to participate in the PTC or not participate, but fully participate in the PTC to pay prevailing wages at the sites. And we have been doing that for years here at PSEG. So no upward O&amp;M impact for us. I don't know if there's anything beyond that, that the others are talking about. But specifically for us, I don't see anything that would be driving additional O&amp;M expenses at those plants.Daniel J. CreggYes. I think we got a pretty good line of sight in the near term on nuclear fuel, David, just given from the standpoint of the fuel and the reactor and then you've got your upcoming fuel reloads and those that as you kind of go through the years, the near term is pretty well hedged and known, and that's on top of the fuel that's in the reactor. So I think we're in pretty good shape for the pursuit -- for the foreseeable future.David Keith ArcaroGot it. Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to clarify on the collateral postings. It's great to see that they've come down maybe sooner than expected. I was wondering if you could just remind us of how the collateral kind of falls off through the year. And is that earlier than you had previously anticipated the, I think, $800 million that you were able to pay down earlier. Is that helpful for EPS in terms of taking some of the short-term debt off the balance sheet for this year?Daniel J. CreggYes, David, we've said before, if you think about most of the price differential and most of the period that we do have hedged, a lot of what we would expect to see is that those positions would roll off through '23 and into the winter of '24 was where the bigger element of the totals were. And so that timing is fairly consistent, I think to the extent that you saw prices come down, you're going to see a lower overall balance to the extent that they go back up, that will continue to move. So it will continue to be dynamic. But to the extent that, that stays a little bit lower as we run through out of these next 12 months, we would have less overall collateral posted, and that would be a benefit.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Ralph A. LaRossaGood to have you back.Durgesh ChopraI am -- can you hear me now?Ralph A. LaRossaWe can.Daniel J. CreggWe can.Durgesh ChopraSorry about that. It was actually my headset. So Dan, thank you. I heard all of that. I appreciate it. Just the uplift, that was roughly another 20% to 30% that would reduce the pension volatility by. And so if you were able to get that successfully, the uplift successfully executed that would essentially basically kind of -- the 50% of the pension expense volatility would have been taken care of, inclusive of this BP order last week. Am I thinking about that correctly?Daniel J. CreggYes. You said uplift, but I think you mean the lift out, right? And so...Durgesh ChopraYes, yes, yes. That's right.Daniel J. CreggYes. So I think that's a good way to think about it. If you think about building blocks, you'll have an element related to the utility with respect to the unrecognized losses and then you would have another element, which would be a comparable size. So I think the way you're thinking about the math is right, just the only caveat is, again, as you do go through time, you'll see the different cost components and return components change a little bit. So you could see some movement. I think that's a fair way to think about it, Durgesh.Durgesh ChopraOkay. Perfect. And then just one last one, again on pension. In terms of timing, you might have said that expect an update sometime this year. So by your Analyst Day here or Investor Day in March, we shouldn't be expecting that you get a pension lift out, right? That's coming later in the year?Daniel J. CreggThat's the right way to think about it, yes.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.Michael P. SullivanI didn't want to like front-run the Analyst Day too much here, but just can you maybe give us a little preview of what else to expect just in terms of new disclosures. I mean, I'd imagine the growth rate and all that is kind of set. But in terms of like some of the nuclear things you alluded to, will we get some more flavor there? And then I guess on the offshore wind side, it sounds like that timing is not really tied to the Analyst Day?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. No, that's not. Look, I would say this to you, Michael. If you walk out of that meeting with even more confidence in our ability to execute on the things that we've been talking about, that would be my goal for that investor meeting. We've done that over the last year in some crazy turbulent times. And I think that you'll see more of that. And I want you to walk out of that meeting with more confidence. So more doubling down on some of the things that we've got planned in the utility -- and that should be the real highlight of the conversation, a little more about our thoughts about how to respond to the governor's call for action.Michael P. SullivanOkay. Great. And then I think this kind of got asked a little bit, but just on the offshore wind, proceeds. So it sounds like the $200 million you already got back is not a big needle mover, but when you stack that on top of what you could potentially get for GSOE, I'd imagine that's a little more material. So kind of how do we think about where those proceeds could go?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. And just so -- Mike, just so we're 100% clear, we have not received the $200 million back yet, right? That's in the process with our partner, and we're going through dotting the Is and crossing the Ts in that whole conversation. So more to come on that front. But I think the materiality of the GSOE is a TBD, and we'll see what the market gives us on that front. And then Dan and the team will do what Dan and the team have done for many years and put to the best use. So.Michael P. SullivanSorry. So are you suggesting that it could end up being immaterial? Like is there a reason that, that wouldn't be worth anything?Ralph A. LaRossaNo, I just don't want to -- we're not building a plan that's based on getting some New York fight multiples on it. So I don't want people to walk away with some inflated opinion of what those acres are going to be worth. We'll see what the market comes back with.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithSo just with respect to hedges here, I just want to come back to this real quickly, a couple of different moving pieces. First off, if I heard right in the comments, BGSS here, you guys are moving away from that. It seems like a slightly more important strategic decision after years of benefiting there. Can you talk about that a little bit here. Again, obviously, not a big contribution. But then also related here, probably more critical and looking forward here, what's your latest interpretation of the PTC and how that interplays with your '24 hedges? And ultimately, how you think about hedging right now considering what IRS may or may not do?Ralph A. LaRossaLet me -- I'm going to give that to Dan to give you some details on it, but that is not a recent move on our part. We have been moving away over time on the BGSS -- and I think we've -- BGS, and we've talked about that for a while, not BGSS, but BGS. And we've been doing that. It's a different product, right? It's more of a shape product than a baseload product that our nuclear plants would support. But Dan will give you a lot more details on that in the hedging piece.Daniel J. CreggYes. And just to be super clear, Julien, if you think about it, the BGS product is a default product in New Jersey on the electric side of the business. And so PSEG Power has used that as a hedge for a long time in PSEG Power had nuclear and Fossil units and had a very shaped output seasonality by virtue of having both nuclear and Fossil generation. And as we sold the Fossil units and we still had BGS obligations. You think about those are 3 years at a time, that was not an ideal fit for nuclear, which is more shaped and more of a block power. And so really don't take too much from the sale of the BGS. It's just those remaining legacy tranches were not a good fit for a nuclear output that looks more like blockchain power.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. And related to -- with respect to New Jersey stakeholders, any update on how you're thinking about treating it there? Any changes in that construct as you think about like a belt and suspenders of the federal program here? I know we heard some comments from your peers here.Daniel J. CreggNo. I mean, look, I think the upshot is that to the extent that PTC is a payment for the attribute and the ZEC is a payment for the attribute, we will net back that amount to the state, and that was in the original ZEC legislation that was put together. And so I think that's -- net-net over the long run, this is going to be a very good thing for New Jersey because the payment for the attribute that's going to help nuclear ensure that it does have financial backing is going to be borne by the federal government rather than just New Jersey, and that will be a positive thing on the bills over the long run.Ralph A. LaRossaYes. And I would just support that by just saying from a belt and suspender standpoint, I think anything we do here we being policymakers in New Jersey would be for next generation. It's not something that would be felt in suspenders for anything near the near term.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. Understood what you mean by that. I appreciate that. All right. Excellent. Appreciate it. Actually, one last quick one on Power, just if you don't mind. With respect to all the commentary from the governor's office, et cetera, are you thinking about updating investments around power and the opportunities to maximize value of those assets here? Again, we've seen some commentary again from some of your peers there, but again, given what's going on with the governor, et cetera. I'm just curious if that is even more of an opportunity.Ralph A. LaRossaYes, I think that flows to the PTC, and that's in my opening remarks a little bit there, Julien, was all about, hey, we potentially do some uprates to Salem, some change in the fuel cycle at Hope Creek and a long-term extension of the licenses themselves. Not to mention, everybody is talking about hydrogen and other things, but we'll talk a little bit more about that on March 10.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.Paul PattersonJust really quickly, just the extension of the licenses, is that already reflected in the depreciation schedule of the assets? And how much might that lower the level of depreciation?Daniel J. CreggYes. So the depreciation runs through 2036, 2040, 2046 for the New Jersey units and 2053, 2054 for the Pennsylvania units. So those are presumptive of the expansions that get you to those dates. But we've talked about -- so there's 2 things going on that we talked about is the potential for another extension in New Jersey that is not what is in place right now. And also, you may recall Peach Bottom in Turkey Point had some questions raised by the NRC about their existing license extension, which has not changed what we have done. We believe that, that will be restored without any change. And so -- with respect to the incremental 20 years, I don't have a number off the top of my head as to what that would do to us, but we can -- that's easy math. I think that's all available, and we can get that to you, Paul.Paul PattersonOkay. And just over the years, we've seen different companies recognize these depreciation changes because of license extensions at different times. Some do it even before they file with the NRC. Some do it only when they get the NRC's official ruling on it. Any thoughts about when we might see the depreciation benefits show up?Daniel J. CreggYes. I think it's most likely when we have in hand the extension.Ralph A. LaRossaPaul, let me just reiterate what Dan said about the timing, right? You got [3600, 4000 and 4600] units and normally, you would apply in about 10 years in advance. So just to kind of set the time frame for you as to when the application is going. We're just talking about it because it would be within the 5 years of our business plan.Paul PattersonOkay, got you.Daniel J. CreggFor the work done, probably not for the receipt of the extension.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Inc.Travis MillerOn the transmission, the onshore of the offshore transmission, any update on solicitations or development there? Anything along those lines?Ralph A. LaRossaNo. We're waiting on that as well. I don't expect anything in the very near term on that. I think the BPU is committed to seeing through the work that they've had approved so far, but we have no indication at this point on the timing of any new solicitations.Travis MillerOkay. Is the gaining factor in the development in future offshore wind? Or would there be additional transmission for current?Ralph A. LaRossaI think a bunch of it has to do with the IRA and understand how the tax treatment would be for a wire or whether it's a wired it's deem a generator lead or a wire that's deemed offshore transmission. So once they get through that process, I think there'll be some better idea about timing.Travis MillerOkay. Makes sense. And then I say the mention about the rate case at the end of the year, anything unusual about that, that would come out or just typical operating cost, capital cost updates.Ralph A. LaRossaNo, just typical.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellJust 2 quick ones. One is a follow-up from Durgesh's 2-parter. You talked about maybe 2 of the 3 parts you were going to use to mitigate pension volatility I think the third part you didn't talk about was a pension tracker that you're going to ask for in the rate case you filed at the end of the year. Any feedback or discussions you've had with policymakers on support or anything around that?Ralph A. LaRossaI'll start and Dan can add anything he wants to put there. But look, at the end of the day, whether it's a tractor or any other kind of mechanism, we absolutely plan to have a conversation with the BPU about that. I'm just very happy with the near term, what we were able to accomplish. And I think the -- combined with the American Water adjustment or mechanism they put in for them, I think the BPU is recognizing there may be some value here for not just for the companies, but for the customers as well as they look at this. So we'll continue to have a conversation. I don't want to get tied into a tracker or a mechanism, but we'll have a conversation about it.Daniel J. CreggYes, it would be part of the whole rate case.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGreat. And then just one last housekeeping. If I look at the long-term EPS growth rate, 5% to 7%, capital spending drives rate base say your 6% to 7.5%, a slight difference there is just the difference on the book ends there. the growth at the CFIO?Ralph A. LaRossaYes, because the 5% to 7% is for enterprise and the rate base growth is solely at the utility. So anything and everything at CFIO is going to be in there. And then you'll have a little bit of noise as you go through O&amp;M and different other components. But I think they're largely consistent, you should think about it in that way.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg Dolman.Paul Basch Michael FremontSort of a quick question on rate base growth. You guys, I think, had a range, but I think most of the stretch CapEx looked to be in the out-year. So I was wondering how you got such a strong level of rate base growth in 2022?Ralph A. LaRossaI'm not -- the only thing I can think of it, I'm trying to interpret your question a little bit, Paul, is whether any [seawhip] kind of worked its way through the numbers that could change your ultimate rate base as you go year-to-year.Paul Basch Michael FremontOkay. Also, can you give a sense per share in terms of what change in pension costs you're assuming in 2023?Daniel J. CreggYes, versus '22?Paul Basch Michael FremontYes.Daniel J. CreggAt EEI, we had given a range of $0.25 to $0.30 for pension and OPEB, and we're right within that range, kind of around the midpoint of that range. So that's a consistent number Obviously, at EEI, we were estimating where we would come out, and we didn't see too much movement either in markets or interest rates that moved us away from that. So if you think about the middle of that range in being pretty good shape.Paul Basch Michael FremontOkay. But you still got the accounting order, right? And that didn't change the range is what you're saying?Daniel J. CreggIt was assumed -- we had filed it at that point, and we had commented that we were optimistic that, that would come through. It came through as expected. So it was part of what we were thinking at the time when we provided the range.Paul Basch Michael FremontRight. And in terms of hedge guidance, I mean, is there a reason why we haven't seen sort of '25 hedge guidance for PEG Power?Daniel J. CreggNo, we kind of updated through '23 and '24. I mean part of the answer could well be if you want to think about it this way, Paul, is that we still are awaiting what treasury is going to do from the standpoint of guidance. And so that's going to be an important element as we go forward.Paul Basch Michael FremontOkay. And then last question for me. You guys gave a gross margin per megawatt hour -- is there any guidance that you can provide on a gross margin per megawatt hour basis for PEG Power in 2023?Ralph A. LaRossaI mean I think we've given you the overall hedge price across '23 and characterized as 95% to 100% there. So I think you'll see that as we go through the quarters.OperatorOur next question comes...Carlotta N. ChanWe have time for one more question.OperatorOkay, no problem. And our last question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Sophie Ksenia KarpMost of my questions have been answered actually, but maybe I can just ask you about the gas utility future in New Jersey, given the -- in the comments that are coming out from the governor and just overall focus on electrification. How do you think about kind of the stuff that you have going into this, what could be a multi-decade trend? Specifically, are your electric and gas territories fully overlapped in terms of customers -- like where whatever you might lose as a gas business, you will gain as an electric business? Or are they kind of cannibalized by other utilities? How should we think about that?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. So it's a mixed bag for us. We have some gas-only territories, some electric-only territories, but the bulk of our customers in bulk are combined. So I don't want to say it's a win-win, but it is a win-win for us to a great extent. And because we're focused on all of our gas investments being replacement activities, not new activities, but replacement activities that are going to help reduce methane. We're thinking those investments all make a ton of sense and will continue. So I actually think about this more from the standpoint of the speed in which we electrify and the cost to consumers and how we think about that. So we'll continue to drive that point. We'll be able to offset a bunch of it with the energy efficiency work that we've started and will continue.OperatorAnd that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. LaRossa for closing comments.Ralph A. LaRossaWell, thank you. And I just -- 3 things I want to hit on. One, again, our thoughts and prayers to all those that were impacted by the tragic events that we had here earlier this month. We just -- the organization is still dealing with that and will continue for probably years to come.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of 2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PSEG , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.14 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 44.03%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.06 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PSEG shares have added about 1.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for PSEG?While PSEG has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PSEG: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.15 on $2.95 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.43 on $9.85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the bottom 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

It declared a full-year dividend of $4.92 per share, down from 2021's record payout of $10.40 per share.Its shares were down 2.2% at 0817 GMT.Strict COVID-19 curbs in top steel producer China curtailed economic activity last year, dragging down iron ore prices from lofty levels a year earlier.But the world's top iron ore producer said Chinese consumption showed signs of rebounding.""It is very positive that China now also comes out of COVID lockdowns ... and we are quietly confident that (China's) demand will be a stabilising factor for the world economy in 2023,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told reporters.China, the world's second-biggest economy, in January re-opened its borders and eased quarantine requirements for travellers after three years of tight controls, and is putting in place policies to boost its sagging economy.Rio Tinto lowered its capital investments guidance for 2023 to $8 billion from $8-9 billion, while raising its estimates for 2024 and 2025 to $9-10 billion.The estimates include around $3 billion a year for growth capital, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Cunningham, as the miner moves to ramp up projects, including Guinea's vast iron ore deposit Simandou, Argentina's lithium asset Rincon and the underground expansion of its massive Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia.Story continuesOn Tuesday, rival BHP Group reported a steeper-than-expected 32% fall in first-half profit but also flagged a brightening outlook in China.Rio Tinto last year earned an average realised price of just $106.10 per dry metric tonne (dmt) of iron ore, down from $143.80 per dmt in 2021.It maintained its production and unit cost guidance for 2023.Additional investments to ramp up production at the Gudai-Darri mine in Pilbara, Australia, along with higher diesel prices and labour costs, resulted in Pilbara unit cash costs rising to $21.30 per tonne in 2022, Rio said.""Similar to the rest of the industry, compressing margins and rising capex will place pressure on free cash flow generation,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said.GROWTH DILEMMADespite the vast volumes of copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt needed for the transition to a lower carbon economy, major mining companies have limited plans to develop mines that take several years to turn a profit.Some have preferred to grow through acquisitions, with BHP making a $6.5 billion cash offer for copper and gold producer OZ Minerals.Others are investing in projects belonging to smaller developers.Rio last year suffered a setback to its ambition to become a significant lithium producer, when the Serbian government revoked licences for its Jadar project after massive protests sparked by environmental concerns over the planned mine.""We have a lot going on, mostly are organic opportunities, except Rincon which was our first acquisition for a decade and then followed that by taking TRQ private,"" Stausholm said.""So we look at it asset by asset - would we like to grow in lithium? Yes. On the other hand, it's very expensive right now.""""I'm not looking at big transformative M&amp;A changes at the moment.

The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, NiSource has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that NI has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.55, while NEE has a forward P/E of 24.42.

NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.70.Another notable valuation metric for NI is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The company recorded currency-adjusted revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. While the trend is expected to continue, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces are concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 1.3% against the industry’s 2.5% growth. The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.2% in the same time period.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.8 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to grow for the next five years at an annual rate of 7.8%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 7.88%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. One of the company’s most notable offerings is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broad private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are likely to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Sales in this segment were up 1.1% year over year during second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Solid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The company’s Companion Animal and Production Animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. The company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 0.7%, owing to sustained strength in the Production Animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review, on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from other national and full-service firms, hundreds of small local distributors, and at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level. PDCO needs to introduce products for withstanding competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has increased from $2.27 to $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.62 billion, indicating a 1.4% improvement from the year-ago period.

The 50.2 reading, up from 46.8 in January, was buoyed by a robust services sector, according to a survey.The report added to a recent slew of economic data which has painted a picture of a resilient economy, which continues to perform against a backdrop of multiple rate-rises by the central bank in 2022 aimed at tamping down inflation.With inflation still far from the Fed's 2% target, and the economy retaining much of its vigor, money market participants have been revising upwards where they see the Fed fund rates peaking - currently at 5.35% in July and staying near those levels throughout the year.""Today, the realization is that the Fed is not kidding around about higher for longer, and in fact it might be a little bit higher for a little-to-a-lot bit longer,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.U.S. stocks had an upbeat start to the year after their worst annual showing in more than a decade in 2022, as investors hoped the central bank's rate-hike cycle was nearing its end.

It declared a full-year dividend of $4.92 per share, down from 2021's record payout of $10.40 per share.Its shares were down 2.2% at 0817 GMT.Strict COVID-19 curbs in top steel producer China curtailed economic activity last year, dragging down iron ore prices from lofty levels a year earlier.But the world's top iron ore producer said Chinese consumption showed signs of rebounding.""It is very positive that China now also comes out of COVID lockdowns ... and we are quietly confident that (China's) demand will be a stabilising factor for the world economy in 2023,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told reporters.China, the world's second-biggest economy, in January re-opened its borders and eased quarantine requirements for travellers after three years of tight controls, and is putting in place policies to boost its sagging economy.Rio Tinto lowered its capital investments guidance for 2023 to $8 billion from $8-9 billion, while raising its estimates for 2024 and 2025 to $9-10 billion.The estimates include around $3 billion a year for growth capital, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Cunningham, as the miner moves to ramp up projects, including Guinea's vast iron ore deposit Simandou, Argentina's lithium asset Rincon and the underground expansion of its massive Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia.Story continuesOn Tuesday, rival BHP Group reported a steeper-than-expected 32% fall in first-half profit but also flagged a brightening outlook in China.Rio Tinto last year earned an average realised price of just $106.10 per dry metric tonne (dmt) of iron ore, down from $143.80 per dmt in 2021.It maintained its production and unit cost guidance for 2023.Additional investments to ramp up production at the Gudai-Darri mine in Pilbara, Australia, along with higher diesel prices and labour costs, resulted in Pilbara unit cash costs rising to $21.30 per tonne in 2022, Rio said.""Similar to the rest of the industry, compressing margins and rising capex will place pressure on free cash flow generation,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said.GROWTH DILEMMADespite the vast volumes of copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt needed for the transition to a lower carbon economy, major mining companies have limited plans to develop mines that take several years to turn a profit.Some have preferred to grow through acquisitions, with BHP making a $6.5 billion cash offer for copper and gold producer OZ Minerals.Others are investing in projects belonging to smaller developers.Rio last year suffered a setback to its ambition to become a significant lithium producer, when the Serbian government revoked licences for its Jadar project after massive protests sparked by environmental concerns over the planned mine.""We have a lot going on, mostly are organic opportunities, except Rincon which was our first acquisition for a decade and then followed that by taking TRQ private,"" Stausholm said.""So we look at it asset by asset - would we like to grow in lithium? Yes. On the other hand, it's very expensive right now.""""I'm not looking at big transformative M&amp;A changes at the moment.

It’s trading around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy QUALCOMM today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $138.75, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because QUALCOMM’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -9.6% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for QUALCOMM. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? QCOM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on QCOM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on QCOM should the price fluctuate below its true value.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with QUALCOMM, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in QUALCOMM, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 points to a change of -23.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.54 indicates a change of +20.7% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.4%. The $38.05 billion and $44.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.9% and +16.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $9.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. EPS of $2.37 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.12%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

154,7d1c5959-4cff-30c6-b12d-b94dcd17f6b4,EXPE,2023-02-22,Online Travel Storytelling Spin Cycle Is Running at Full Speed,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/online-travel-storytelling-spin-cycle-073000401.html,1677051000,STORY,"['ABNB', 'EXPE', 'TRIP']","[Online Travel This WeekIt’s another earnings season so online travel companies such as Airbnb, Expedia and Tripadvisor occasionally present facts in a misleading — or at least in an exceedingly positive-sounding — way.Airbnb ProductivityAirbnb officials mentioned twice in their discussion last week with financial analysts about 2022 earnings that their roster of 6,800 employees at the end of 2022 was 5 percent lower than during pre-pandemic 2019 yet Airbnb’s revenue has increased 75 percent to $8.4 billion.That means significantly more revenue per employee these days.What Airbnb execs didn’t mention, however, is that Airbnb at the end of 2022 “relied on a global network of approximately 11,000 third-party contingent workers to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts,” as noted in its annual financial filing.As with the size of its full-time workforce, which Airbnb reduced by 25 percent in May 2020, the company likewise terminated many contract workers, and a bunch of them handled customer service, at that time. Airbnb hasn’t disclosed how many third-party contract workers it added in the interim, and how this may have impacted the productivity numbers the company boasts about.Expedia U.S. Is a ThingExpedia has often spoken about how it performed in the U.S., its biggest market, but it seldom talks about “Expedia U.S.,” as it did seven times in its fourth quarter earnings call earlier this month, as if Expedia U.S. were a new division or a separate brand.Expedia Group sought to showcase the performance of the Expedia brand in the U.S. because it intentionally gave short shrift in marketing to some other geographies around the world and de-emphasized certain noncore brands, too.Expedia U.S. saw its loyalty numbers jump 300 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2019, and it has nearly 60 percent more engaged app users, the company said.Story continuesNo word on how the loyalty program and engaged app user numbers might have jumped or declined on a global basis, though.Overall, some of that upside in the U.S. got deflated with under-performance abroad so Expedia was putting a pretty shine on the statistics it brought to the fore.“Of course, when you look at our all-up B2C (business to consumer) numbers, the accelerating performance of Expedia U.S. has been largely offset by our intentional de-emphasis of some smaller noncore brands or pull back in certain geographies where we did not have the right model, and of course, our much-discussed technical migration, which required significant work and like all migrations resulted in some short-term friction,” Expedia Group Peter Kern said.But Expedia faces challenges even in its U.S. home turf. A Skift Research survey of U.S. travelers found that Expedia’s U.S. “websites saw a 10 point share decline, falling from 59 percent of OTA [online travel agency] bookings in 2020 to 49 percent in 2022.”Booking.com is seemingly behind some of Expedia’s weakness.“Right off the bat, the most shocking result is that, in our survey data, Booking.com surpassed Expedia.com as the most used booking site in the U.S. in 2022,” the Skift Research report found. “Expedia.com had been number one in 2020 and 2021 with Booking.com in second place.”That would be a disturbing result for Expedia in its homeland.Tripadvisor Metasearch in the U.S. Bounced BackHotel metasearch is an important part of Tripadvisor’s core business, and the company disclosed last week that the feature’s revenue only clawed back in 2022 to 85 percent of 2019 levels.The company also stated that its U.S. metasearch revenue — as distinct from its global metasearch revenue — achieved “parity” in 2022 with 2019 numbers, and was accelerating as it headed into 2023.What parity means wasn’t specifically defined but, hey, fair enough.In BriefSection 230 ChallengesThe U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case that could potentially upend online travel in unforeseen ways. The case revolves around a challenge to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which for years has given online platforms in the U.S. broad liability protections for review and video content they host that is created by third parties. A ruling striking down parts of Section 230 could alter the business models of numerous travel and tech companies. CNBCTrivago and Tripadvisor Metasearch Fell BehindIs metasearch dead? Hardly, just ask Google. But two of the sector’s weaker public company players, Trivago and Tripadvisor, saw their metasearch numbers at lethargic levels compared with other sectors in 2022. SkiftTripadvisor Generative AI IssuesCan you think of a more easy application for generative AI to attach itself to than creating an in-destination tour? Tripadvisor’s turnaround strategy involves creating new trip-planning tools that are distinct from the competition. Will generative AI make that even more difficult or, on the other hand, create a bigger revenue stream for Tripadvisor as a licensor of its hotel review content?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy. After delivering a record-breaking performance in 2022, dividend stocks are grabbing the spotlight this year as well. Investors often seek dividend stocks with high yields as they help them to generate stable and passive income. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, high-yield dividend stocks remained stable during periods of market decline, whereas earnings tend to drop during a recession. The report further mentioned that the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s.Columbia Business School also conducted research that highlighted the performance of high-yield dividend stocks. The report mentioned that the High Dividend Index delivered an annual average return of 6.16% from January 2000 to May 2010, versus a 4.75% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Dividend companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive years are popular among investors, as these companies significantly boost their income. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have raised their payouts for decades, becoming top choices for investors.Though high yields are crucial to regular income generation, they sometimes carry certain risks with them. Companies that pay out a large portion of their earnings in dividends may have less cash to reinvest in the business, which could limit their ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions. Moreover, declining sales also result in a drop in share prices, which ultimately leads to high dividend yields. For picking high-dividend stocks, investors must evaluate the respective company’s financial health and basic fundamentals.Story continues15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You can BuyDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 11% to 19%, as of February 20.

However, adjusted earnings declined 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.38 in the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and the new European Union medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP EPS was 92 cents, down 16.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.73 billion, up 4.1% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency and contribution from the company's fiscal first-quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT) and flat year over year on a reported basis. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.Third-quarter organic revenues, according to the company, reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience business, in international Diabetes markets and improved product availability across certain businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from ventilator sales, given the strong year-ago comparable due to COVID-19 severity, and sales in China, given volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes.Q3 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) were up 3% on a reported basis (up 2% on an organic basis) to $4.06 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.29 billion (30% of total revenues), down 6% on a reported basis (up 6% on an organic basis).Emerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.37 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 5% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 6.5% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 7.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from Structural Heart &amp; Aortic were up 8.8% at CER to $760 million. Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular revenues were up 1.5% at CER to $581 million.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.14 billion, down 1.6% year over year at CER. The company reported low-single-digit declines in both Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal. Excluding the unfavorable impact of ventilator sales, and sales in China, given the unfavorable impact of provincial VBP tenders, Medical Surgical revenues increased 3% organic.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.25 billion were up 8.5% year over year at CER, driven by a low-double-digit increase in Specialty Therapies and mid-single-digit increases in Neuromodulation and Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies, all organically.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $570 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenues declined in the mid-teens in Q3, offset by high-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-twenties growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by the high-teens growth of insulin pumps, mid-thirties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products on strong sales of the MiniMed 780G system and the associated increase in CGM attachment rates on the strength of the Guardian 4 sensor.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 312 basis points (bps) to 65.2% on a 5% fall in gross profit to $5.04 billion.Research and development expenses were up 2.9% year over year at $688 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 428 bps year over year to 22.5%.GuidanceMedtronic issued fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter guidance and updated its fiscal 2023 guidance.Fourth-quarter organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-5%. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of February, fourth-quarter revenues would be unfavorably affected by approximately $165 million to $215 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal Q4 worldwide revenues is pegged at $7.97 billion.The full-year adjusted EPS projection has been updated to the range of $5.28 to $5.30 (reflecting an increase in the lower end of the earlier-projected band of $5.25 to $5.30), including an estimated 21 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.26.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal third quarter. Barring the Medical Surgical group, the company reported year-over-year sales growth in each of its reporting segments organically. The company’s updated sales outlook for fiscal 2023 assumes considerable organic growth from the year-ago period’s levels, instilling optimism.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. The contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc.

The Aurora EV-ICD system is investigational in the United States.For investors’ note, CE Mark approval is backed by the Pivotal Study of Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (EV ICD), demonstrating its safety and effectiveness endpoints. The data was presented as late-breaking science at the European Society of Cardiology 2022 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The recent development is likely to fortify Medtronic’ Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio.More about Aurora EV-ICD systemThe Aurora EV-ICD system offers the life-saving benefits of traditional ICDs while evading certain risks because its lead (thin wire) is placed outside the heart and veins. The system is indicated for patients at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, who have not had a prior sternotomy and who do not require chronic bradycardia (abnormally slow heartbeat) pacing.The Aurora EV-ICD is implanted below the left armpit (in the left mid-axillary region) and the Epsila EV lead is placed under the breastbone (sternum) with a minimally-invasive approach. Placing the lead outside of the heart and veins is intended to help dodge long-term complications that may be associated with transvenous leads, such as vessel occlusion (narrowing, blockage or compression of a vein) and risks for blood infections.The Aurora EV-ICD system is likely to be commercially available in autumn 2023 in select countries in Europe.Benefits of Aurora EV-ICD systemThe growing awareness by patients and physicians about the risks that come with placing leads in the heart or veins is addressed by the Aurora EV-ICD system that offers an extravascular solution and maintains the traditional ICD benefits of pacing and defibrillation therapy.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer Medtronic’s management, it is the first company to offer a complete one-system, one-procedure extravascular ICD solution, which maintains the patient benefits of traditional, transvenous ICDs without the risk of leads in the heart and vasculature. This approval is a noteworthy milestone in achieving the goal of providing a defibrillation solution that treats sudden cardiac arrest while improving the patient experience.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global cardiac rhythm management devices market size was $18.1 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 6.5% by 2030. The growing prevalence of various cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, are driving the market.Recent DevelopmentsIn December 2022, Medtronic announced the enrolment of the first patient in the Expand URO U.S. clinical trial for the Hugo robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system. The robotic prostatectomy was performed at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C. The Hugo RAS system and Touch Surgery Enterprise provide a smart, digitally-enabled surgical experience. Outside the United States, the Hugo RAS system is utilized in hospitals across three continents in an array of procedures within urology, gynecology and general surgery.In the same month, Medtronic announced the completion of enrollment and final treatment in the SPHERE Per-AF Trial, FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) pivotal trial.

171,8f8c373c-9f7b-3fd1-b0bf-0b4e9f2f5da1,MDT,2023-02-22,Medtronic stock rises on Q3 earnings as company tightens outlook,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/medtronic-stock-rises-q3-earnings-150025042.html,1676991625,VIDEO,['MDT'],"[Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Brad Smith discuss the rise in stock for Medtronic following third-quarter earnings.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: All right, well, let's also talk about Medtronic this morning here. They beat estimates on the top and bottom line, reflecting strong performances in the cardiovascular and neuroscience portfolios, as the medical device company tightens its full year EPS guidance for fiscal 2023. Shares, they're moving higher by about 1.5% this morning. We mentioned some of those key highlights. They've also increased their fiscal year 2023 organic revenue growth outlook, as well as their earnings growth outlook too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and they're talking about this being a transition year because of inflation. So that's something that investors have to continue as well. And the shares are not doing a heck of a lot. They're up about 1.2%, perhaps because of that framing as being a transition time. We're looking for any kind of updates from them on supply chain issues because they have, since they make stuff, they've had issues with semiconductors and plastics, things like that. And the company's surgical innovations unit, which makes tools for surgery, saw revenue fall 6%, to about $1.43 billion, just something to focus on as well.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. They're taking a look at each of the segments there. And medical surgical was actually one of the ones that I was looking into here, overall decrease there by about 7%. So that's where that surgical innovations that you were mentioning falls underneath of.But kind of looking at the organic bases and where this company can continue to grow out its portfolio, I think for the different levels of consolidation that we've seen, especially within the health care or health tech industry, Medtronic, I think there could be, within this broader industry that they're operating within, even more of that consolidation that comes forward over the course of this year. It's just a matter of how much they're able to hold on to their own existing market share, as you do see some of that consolidation continue to come into the fray on the equipment front.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And it looks like they did OK in China, or they beat estimates in various segments, despite COVID coming back in China, which affects other types of procedures that people get done. So that's something to watch as well, if they continue business there.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NIKE, Inc. NKE, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, KLA Corp. KLAC, Airbnb, Inc. ABNB and Republic Services, Inc. RSG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Nike, Union Pacific and KLA Corp.The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc., Union Pacific Corp. and KLA Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NIKE shares were in line with the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+7.2% vs. +7.1%). The company reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results and provided an upbeat sales view. It reported the 10th and the fifth straight quarters of earnings and revenue beat, respectively. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.Its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses bode well. Our Model estimates 5.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2023, with 13.2% growth on a currency neutral basis.NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. The Zacks analyst expects soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Also, the new U.S. export regulations, supply-chain disruptions and mounting expenses remain overhangs.(You can read the full research report on KLA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Airbnb, Inc. and Republic Services, Inc..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

They are successfully battling headwinds from worldwide logistics, geo-political issues and heightened raw material costs. These select Companies are instituting new operating efficiencies, cost-cutting strategies and planning expansion into higher growth markets.These stocks are diamonds in the rough attracting investors with higher dividends, improved multi-year fiscal performance and some are offering attractive share buyback programs.The pressure is on to grow crops more efficiently to feed everyone globally. The world’s population number is approaching eight billion this year. Farmers need to apply agricultural chemicals to fertilizers to improve crop yield and prevent phosphorus and nitrogen runoff and evaporation.The lingering war in Ukraine has disrupted the global food chain. But management of several agricultural chemical stocks predict the market will reassert itself within the next two harvest cycles. The result for investors is a jump in the global agricultural chemicals market to an estimated $292 billion by 2030, researchers Statista and Next Move Strategy Consulting say.As an undervalued stock industry, this sector is soaring with growth opportunities.Zacks: Agricultural Chemical Stocks Bank On Strategic MeasuresAmong the sector's most promising stocks for investors are Flexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF), Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE: NTR) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS). Analyst Zacks tells investors that some of the stocks in the Agricultural Chemicals sector are worth considering ‘for your portfolio’.Here are some notables:Zacks Sees FSI As Aggressive In Exploring For New Opportunities Flexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI) offers investors who are willing to take a little more risk within the agricultural chemicals sector a special opportunity. FSI is a developer and manufacturer of biodegradable polymers for oil extraction, detergent ingredients, and water treatment, as well as crop nutrient availability chemistry. Analyst Zacks sees it as a Company, particularly its NanoChem Division, as aggressive in exploring for new opportunities in applications such as detergent, water treatment, oil field extraction and agriculture to grow sales and net income.Story continuesFSI’s net profit was $3.4 million in 2021,16% higher than its $2.9 million in 2020. FSI stock is trading at a PE ratio (TTM) of 9.84.FSI’s volume expanded to $45.7 million in 2022 from $34.4 million in 2021, a 33% jump. In 2020, FSI’s volume was $31.4 million, 10% higher than the prior year.""Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, FSI feels like a great value stock right now,” concludes analyst firm Zacks. Investor Place lists FSI as one of its ‘hyper-growth stocks with 10x potential in 2023.” A Seeking Alpha analyst considers FSI stock a ‘buy,’ based on an analysis of multiples and growth over the past five years.Complete financial results for 2022 will be available on March 31, 2023 concurrent with SEC filings. A conference call will be held on the next business day, Monday, April 3, 2023.One of FSI’s goals is to feed the world’s growing population more efficiently. It is doing so profitably and reporting annual sales growth. It is a environmental technology company.The NanoChem Solutions, Inc. Division of FSI, with proprietary agricultural products EX-10, Sun Savr 30 and Sun 27, are specialty chemicals that successfully commercialize technology. They mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and evaporation. This means farmers can deliver more efficient production and improved crop yields.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Eyes ‘Strong Cash Generation’ In FutureCF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF) reported full year 2022 performance net earnings at $3.35 billion on net sales for the full year of $11.19 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.880 billion. In Q4, CF repurchased some 2.2 million of its shares for $223 million. Tony Will, president and CEO of the Company, said, at CF “We believe that the global nitrogen supply-demand balance and global energy cost structure will continue to present attractive margin opportunities for our cost-advantaged network.”As a result, Will predicted ‘strong cash generation’ in the years ahead and anticipates seeing strong demand for its low-carbon ammonia. He said ‘substantial capital’ would be returned to shareholders. Global nitrogen demand will remain high, he asserted, as the need to replenish stocks will mean continued high prices for corn, wheat and canola. Management estimates it will take two full years of harvests to fully replenish harvest grain stocks. In North America, Will forecasts positive farm economics in 2023. This includes strong crop futures prices and improving yields. In the spring of 2023, 91-93 million acres of corn will be planted, CF forecasts.At a PE ratio (TTM) of 5.03, CF is trading at what appears to be an undervalued level. According to an analysis by Zacks Equity Research, CF’s Q4 per share earnings rise of 33% beat its own Consensus Estimate even as CF’s reported sales lagged estimates, it said. However, share prices of CF rose 11.5% in the past year — compared to a 2.6% rise for the industry in this period.CF’s Board has approved a new $3 billion share repurchase program after the current buyback program is completed through 2025, the Company said. CF repurchased 14.9 million shares for $1.35 billion in 2022 and had at the end of 2022 some $150 million remaining for more buybacks through the end of this authorization period through 2024.NTR Sees 2023 Agricultural Fundamentals Remaining StrongNutrien Ltd. (NYSE: NTR) cited geopolitical supply disruption and market volatility across the agriculture, energy and fertilizer markets in reporting its full year 2022 performance results. It particularly noted the impact of the war in Ukraine constricting crop production. It reported net earnings of $7.7 billion on sales of $37.9 billion. Q4 2022 reached $1.1 billion net income on volume of $7.5 billion.Guidance for 2023 is in an EBITDA range of $8.4 billion-$10 billion with adjusted net earnings per share of $8.45-$10.65. The company said it is basing these guidance totals on its views that agricultural fundamentals remain strong in 2023 and will see the lowest grain stocks-to-use ratio in over 25 years. Further, NTR believes the Ukrainian crop production will continue to be constrained by the Ukraine war with Russia and will take more than one growing season to alleviate the supply risk from the market.Analyst Zacks Equity Research found that the Company’s Q4 2022 sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate as NTR “faced headwinds from lower sales volumes and higher cost inventory.” It noted that the Company successfully repurchased some 53 million shares in 2022 and has already bought back an additional eight million shares in 2023.With a market valuation of $38.9 billion, NTR is an opportunity trading at a PE ratio of (TTM) 5.31 today. Trading at $77 per share now, its 52-week high is $117.25.MOS Seen As a Great Dividend Stock The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) a producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop fertilizers for the global agriculture industry, has voted to increase it shareholder dividend yield to 1.6% in 2023. Dividends are seen as easily covered by Company earnings — making this a potentially bright dividend stock, according to SimplyWallStreet. “All of these things considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock,” Simply Wall Street concludes.MOS has set February 22 for its Q4 and full year 2022 announcement of fiscal results. Its earnings conference call is scheduled for February 23.Analyst Zacks sees MOS’ 8.4% gains over the past month as indicative of a possible 12.1% sales gain YOY fiscal performance. Zack awards MOS an ‘A’ for its stock trading at a discount to its peers.Simply Wall Street is encouraged that MOS has been growing its earnings per share at 63% a year over the past five years. This suggests to SWS that MOS is effectively and positively reinvesting in its business.MOS predicts 2023 will be a ‘strong year’ for nutrient application supported by healthy crop prices and grower economics. With a PE ratio stuck stubbornly under five at a (TTM) of only 4.86, MOS enjoys a market cap of $17.0 billion.In its 10Q SEC filing on November 2, 2022, MOS reported sales for its three months ended September 30 of $5.35 billion, a 56.5% increase from its $3.4 billion the comparable period the previous year. Net income attributable to Mosaic jumped to $841.7 million in the 2022 quarter from $371.9 million the previous year.The Company cited the war in Ukraine for a disruption of fertilizer and agricultural commodities that resulted in a rise in prices for its products. MOS said Chinese reductions in phosphate exports were impacting the global fertilizer market.CONCLUSION Agricultural Specialty Chemicals stocks are attracting investors, especially its undervalued stocks.

This has helped boost the carrier’s confidence in the future, underpinning some audacious moves to maintain — and expand — its position as a leading global airline.The carrier posted a 16 percent operating margin in the December quarter, the third in its fiscal year that ends in March; that bested its performance during the first six months of its fiscal year by a point. Singapore Airlines was lifted by fuel hedge gains, without which its operating margin was 12 percent, but even that was two points better than three years earlier. It reported an operating profit of S$755 million ($565 million) for the three months ending in December.What’s more, Singapore Airlines posted record revenues of S$4.8 billion, up 6.7 percent year-over-three-years, in the December quarter. Unit revenues, measured by revenue per available seat kilometer, also set a record at 10.8 Singapore dollar cents, or up nearly 33 percent compared to 2019.Cargo was one area of weakness for Singapore Airlines. Revenues and yields decreased in the December quarter from the quarter before with the carrier citing a weaker global macroeconomic environment, as well as the increase in aircraft belly capacity. However, cargo yields were still more than double what they were three years earlier.Set against the backdrop of strong financial results, not to mention a bullish outlook, Singapore Airlines made a number of deals looking toward its future. The most significant was an agreement in November with the Tata Group to take a 25.1 percent stake in Air India in exchange for the group’s minority stake in Vistara and S$360 million. Singapore Airlines has repeatedly cited the deal as key to its direct participation in the “large and fast-growing” Indian market. Air India committed to at least 470 Airbus and Boeing aircraft earlier in February in the airline’s largest-ever order.Singapore Airlines plans to launch a new codeshare with Thai Airways later this year. The deal will funnel travelers from Thai’s network onto Singapore Airlines longhaul flights to the Americas and South Africa — two markets Thai does not currently serve — over Singapore Changi airport. And the carrier earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam Airlines for codesharing.Story continuesAnd, Singapore Airlines budget subsidiary Scoot on February 17 signed a letter of intent with lessor Azorra for nine Embraer E190-E2s with deliveries in 2024 and 2025. The 112-seat aircraft will be used to open “thinner routes to non-metro destinations” unserved by Scoot or Singapore Airlines fleet of larger Airbus and Boeing planes. Scoot’s smallest aircraft is the Airbus A320 with 180 seats, and Singapore Airlines’ smallest is the Boeing 737-8 with 154 seats.Singapore Airlines and Scoot ended December with a combined 195 aircraft, including seven freighters. The former expects deliveries of one Airbus A350-900 and one Boeing 787-10 in the March quarter.On the travel demand front, Singapore Airlines described it as “robust” in the December quarter, and “expected to be robust” in the March quarter. It cited the easing of Covid travel restrictions in China in January, Hong Kong in late December, and other countries in the region as some of the drivers of its outlook. Forward bookings “remain strong,” the carrier added.Singapore Airlines flew 80 percent of its 2019 passenger capacity in December and plans to fly roughly 77 percent of four years ago in the March quarter. The carrier resumed flights to Beijing and Guangzhou in January, according to Diio by Cirium schedules.This story is from Skift's Airline Weekly.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Soros' investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns. Hungarian-born American investor George Soros is one of the world’s most celebrated hedge fund managers. He recently made the headlines for passing controversial remarks about Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the Munich Security Conference. However, the backlash he received from the audience did not hold any effect on his investments in India. In the fourth quarter of 2022, his hedge fund increased its position in an Indian startup, Freshworks, to over $33.3 million.Soros is mainly famous for making $1.1 billion in profits by betting on the British pound’s fall in 1992. Because of this stunt, he widely came to be known as ‘the man who broke the Bank of England’. As of February 2023, the billionaire’s real-time net worth came in at $6.7 billion.Soros Fund Management follows a global macro strategy, making bets on currency rates and other economic fluctuations. Soros studies the financial markets carefully as well as gauges the behaviors of market participants. Soros believes that the behavior of market participants is crucial in understanding the irregular and fluctuating nature of the market. Following these investment philosophies, his hedge fund managed to report positive returns over the years. The fund averaged an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. In 2020, his fund gained 23.2%, versus an average hedge fund return of 11.6% during the same year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.As of the close of Q4 2022, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio has a value of over $7.26 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in the previous quarter. Some of the hedge fund’s major holdings in Q4 included Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). However, in this article, we will focus on dividend stocks that billionaire George Soros owns.Story continues10 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros OwnsGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks in Soros Fund Management's portfolio, as of Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in the fund.Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $784,280  Dividend Yield as of February 21: 2.77% The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

In Q4 2022, the hedge fund did not change its position in the company and owned stakes worth $784,280. The company made up 0.01% of the billionaire George Soros's portfolio. Other prominent holdings of the hedge fund include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).On January 17, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion. Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness were some of the company's most prominent stakeholders in Q4.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)9.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyworks-solutions-inc-nasdaq-swks-101814787.html,1677061094,STORY,['SWKS'],"[Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Skyworks Solutions investors that purchase the stock on or after the 27th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.62 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.48 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Skyworks Solutions has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of $112.49. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Skyworks Solutions can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Skyworks Solutions paid out a comfortable 32% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Skyworks Solutions generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 33% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Skyworks Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Skyworks Solutions, with earnings per share up 6.3% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Skyworks Solutions has delivered an average of 21% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past nine years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Skyworks Solutions? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Skyworks Solutions is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Skyworks Solutions is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. Skyworks Solutions looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.So while Skyworks Solutions looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Skyworks Solutions that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

However, continued higher spending on the deployment of 5G networking, gaining from the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, is a catalyst. The democratization of 5G smartphones is another tailwind for the industry players. This has bolstered the demand for radio-frequency semiconductor solutions, enhancing the prospects of prominent industry players like Skyworks Solutions SWKS and Akoustis AKTS.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency Industry comprises companies that provide Radio Frequency solutions, Front-end Modules, low-noise amplifiers, diodes, multi-chip modules, optical components, surface acoustic wave, bulk acoustic wave technology-based antenna-plexers, and film bulk acoustic resonator filters to enable smartphone devices to function more efficiently in congested RF spectrum. They serve a wide array of industries with their solutions, finding ample applications in 5G and smartphone equipment, aerospace and defense, optical networks, cellular base stations, automotive, and smart home applications. Most of these companies utilize robust wafer fabrication technologies, as well as ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, silicon germanium and Gallium Nitride technologies, to stay ahead of the competition.3 Trends Influencing the Prospects of the Semiconductors - RF IndustryAccelerated 5G Deployment is a Tailwind: The rapid implementation of 5G networking infrastructure and the robust adoption of cloud computing applications hold promise for the wireless communication market. The coronavirus crisis-induced work-from-home wave has necessitated the need for higher bandwidth and triggered LTE advancements, which are expected to bolster the demand for RF power amplifiers. Increasing RF content in the latest 5G smartphones is a key catalyst. Moreover, demand recovery in the smartphone market is likely to aid the prospects of the major industry players. Shipments of 5G smartphones are projected to account for more than 60% of the global volume in 2022, per IDC estimates.Innovation is Opening up Business Avenues: The rapid proliferation of IoT, wearables, drones, VR/AR devices, autonomous cars, and ADAS is expected to drive the demand for RF semiconductor products beyond smartphone devices, favoring industry prospects. Notably, RF Semiconductors are setting the pace for technology modernization by consequently digitizing aspects like connectivity, healthcare, transport and defense. Diversified utilization of RF Semiconductor products bodes well for the industry players. Moreover, the evolution of semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10 nanometers (nm) to 7 nm, and even 5 nm and 3 nm technology, is anticipated to bolster the industry prospects. Further, the rollout of bands and band combinations has led to considerable design challenges for OEM smartphone manufacturers.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NIKE, Inc. NKE, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, KLA Corp. KLAC, Airbnb, Inc. ABNB and Republic Services, Inc. RSG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Nike, Union Pacific and KLA Corp.The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc., Union Pacific Corp. and KLA Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NIKE shares were in line with the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+7.2% vs. +7.1%). The company reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results and provided an upbeat sales view. It reported the 10th and the fifth straight quarters of earnings and revenue beat, respectively. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.Its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses bode well. Our Model estimates 5.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2023, with 13.2% growth on a currency neutral basis.NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. The Zacks analyst expects soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind. Also, the new U.S. export regulations, supply-chain disruptions and mounting expenses remain overhangs.(You can read the full research report on KLA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Airbnb, Inc. and Republic Services, Inc..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nike (NKE) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.54 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 20, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.54 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.50 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nike has an Earnings ESP of 7.19%.NKE is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. AMC Entertainment (AMC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 28, 2023, AMC Entertainment holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.18 a share seven days from its next quarterly update.AMC Entertainment's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 8.86% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.20.Story continuesNKE and AMC's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Priority Review for the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for elranatamab, an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3-targeted bispecific antibody (BsAb), for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Priority Review is intended to direct attention and resources from regulatory authorities toward drugs that, if approved, could offer significant improvements over existing options for serious conditions in order to make these drugs available to patients faster. The FDA’s decision on the application is expected in 2023. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted elranatamab’s marketing authorization application (MAA). The company is working closely with the EMA to facilitate their review and will provide updates on timing as appropriate.""Today, multiple myeloma is a fatal hematologic malignancy, with a median survival of just over five years. As an off-the-shelf treatment, BCMA bispecific antibodies are heralding a new treatment paradigm that can greatly impact the lives of people with this disease."" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We believe that elranatamab, if approved, has the potential to become the next standard of care for multiple myeloma given its favorable clinical results and convenient subcutaneous route of administration. We look forward to working with the FDA and EMA to bring this new innovative medicine to patients globally.""Elranatamab is designed to bind to BCMA, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and CD3 receptors found on the surface of T-cells, bridging them together and activating the T-cells to kill the myeloma cells. The BLA and MAA for elranatamab are primarily based on data from cohort A (BCMA-naïve - n=123) of MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359), an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elranatamab monotherapy in patients with RRMM. Enrolled patients represent a heavily pretreated population, who previously received at least three classes of therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.Story continuesWith a median follow up of 10.4 months, patients who received elranatamab as their first BCMA-targeted therapy achieved a high objective response rate of 61% (55% had a very good partial response rate or better), with an 84% probability of maintaining the response at nine months. The MagnetisMM-3 results also suggest elranatamab has a manageable safety profile. The two-step-up priming dose regimen (12/32 mg) helped mitigate the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) among the 119 patients in cohort A who were treated with this priming regimen. All cases of CRS were Grade 1 or 2 and the majority occurred after the first (43% of patients) or second (24% of patients) dose, with only 6% of patients experiencing CRS after dose 3 and fewer than 1% experiencing CRS after dose 4. Observed cases of ICANS (3%) were neither common nor severe (Grade 1/2 only were reported). No fatal neurotoxicity events were observed. These data were presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2022.This study is part of the MagnetisMM clinical research program that expands to additional patient populations over time, with ongoing registrational-intent trials that explore elranatamab both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies, spanning multiple patient populations, from newly diagnosed MM to RRMM. This includes MagnetisMM-5 (NCT05020236) in the double class exposed setting, MagnetisMM-6 (NCT05623020) in transplant ineligible newly diagnosed patients, and MagnetisMM-7 (NCT05317416) as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed patients after transplant, all of which are currently enrolling.In November 2022, Pfizer announced that elranatamab was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. In addition, elranatamab has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of MM. The FDA and EMA have also granted elranatamab Fast Track Designation and the PRIME scheme, respectively, for the treatment of patients with RRMM. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted elranatamab Innovative Medicine Designation and the Innovation Passport for the treatment of MM. The FDA has accepted elranatamab for Project ORBIS, which is a framework for the concurrent submission and review of oncology products to potentially expedite approvals in certain countries outside of the US; currently 5 countries (Switzerland, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Singapore) have accepted to participate.About ElranatamabElranatamab is an investigational, off-the-shelf, humanized BCMA CD3-targeted BsAb. BsAbs are a novel form of cancer immunotherapy that bind to and engage two different targets at once. One arm binds directly to specific antigens on cancer cells and the other arm binds to T-cells, bringing both cell types together. The binding affinity of elranatamab for BCMA and CD3 has been engineered to elicit potent T-cell-mediated anti-myeloma activity. Elranatamab is administered subcutaneously, which offers more convenience over intravenous administration.About MagnetisMM-3MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elranatamab monotherapy in patients with RRMM. Patients received subcutaneous (SC) elranatamab 76 mg weekly (QW) on a 28-day cycle with a step-up priming dose regimen, wherein 12 mg and 32 mg are administered on Day 1 and Day 4, respectively, during Cycle 1. For patients receiving 6 or more cycles and achieving a partial response or better for at least 2 months, the dosing interval was once every two weeks (Q2W).About Multiple MyelomaMM is a blood cancer that affects plasma cells made in the bone marrow. Healthy plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight infection. There are over 34,000 new cases of MM diagnosed annually in the U.S. and 176,000 globally.1,2 Despite treatment advances, there is currently no cure. The median survival is just over five years, and most patients receive four or more lines of therapy.3About Pfizer in HematologyAt Pfizer, we have an industry-leading portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicines and biosimilars, including seven therapies to treat hematologic malignancies.

The information helped Fox secure the U.S. English-language rights with a $425 million bid. Telemundo, a division of Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, won U.S. Spanish-language rights for about $600 million.“I was disappointed,” Skipper said. “In fact, I was angry.”Skipper said he had assumed the highest bidder would prevail, but the process turned increasingly complicated when ESPN's offer was turned down and soccer officials opened a second round of bidding.Under questioning from a defense attorney, Skipper acknowledged that he did not know if anything illegal was going on behind the scenes.The trial is the latest development in a tangled corruption scandal that dates back nearly a decade and has ensnared more than three dozen media and soccer executives as well as associates.Story continuesSkipper's testimony was meant to corroborate statements by the government's star witness, Alejandro Burzaco, who testified over 11 days that he and the former Fox executives conspired to bribe South American soccer officials for TV rights to the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest annual tournament, the Copa Libertadores, and help land broadcasting rights to the World Cup, the sport’s most lucrative competition.Lawyers for Lopez and Martinez have asserted that the former executives are being framed, with one defense lawyer accusing Burzaco of masterminding the bribes.Burzaco is a former business partner of Lopez and Martinez, and headed an Argentinian marketing firm. He has cooperated in previous soccer corruption investigations since being arrested in 2015 in a bribery case. Critics contend he's cooperating to avoid prison.Burzaco has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. He testified in 2017 that all three South Americans on the FIFA executive council took million-dollar bribes to support Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup.Skipper said ESPN initially bid $250 million in 2011 for U.S. English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The company upped that to $400 million in a second round. Coupled with Univision's proposed contribution, the total came to $900 million.“We wanted to blow the bid away,” he said.ESPN held U.S. broadcasting rights for the World Cup from 1994 until 2014, first airing soccer's premier sporting event before it caught on with U.S. audiences. FIFA previously had to buy air time to get the tournament broadcast in the country.As the sport's audience grew, so did the World Cup's financial cachet.ESPN paid $100 million for the rights to broadcast the sporting event in 2010 and 2014.The dramatic hike spoke to the sporting event's increasing importance, Skipper said.December's World Cup final in Qatar, where Argentina prevailed over France in a dramatic title-clinching shootout, was the most-watched soccer match in the United States, according to television audience estimates.As a courtesy for helping FIFA develop a rise in soccer viewership, Skipper had hoped soccer officials would allow ESPN to match or beat competitors' proposals but was not approached to do so.So far, more than two dozen people have pleaded guilty and two people have been convicted at trial in connection with a U.S.-led investigation into tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks at soccer’s highest levels. Four corporate entities have also pleaded guilty. Four other companies were charged but reached agreements with the government to avoid prosecution.Soccer governing body, FIFA, has said it was not involved in any fraud or conspiracies and was a mere bystander as the scandal unfolded.Nevertheless, the scandal thrust the organization under worldwide scrutiny. It has since sought to polish its tarnished image.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global investment dynamics and go directly to the 10 Best Countries to Invest In.There are trade-offs to investing in different countries. Investing in countries that are lower on the ladder of development is risky but the returns are much more lucrative than developed countries because of relative uncertainty but a lot of room for development. The opposite is true for developed economies. The reason is that the GDP growth is lower in developed countries because the bigger proportion of spending shifts away from goods, and towards services, as noted in the book titled Fully Grown: Why a Stagnant Economy is a Sign of Success by Economics Professor Dietrich Vollrath. However, a shift to services leads to a decline in productivity growth, not because of something inherently wrong with services, but due to the fact that manufacturing is far more complementary to economies of scale. Capital accumulation is also an aggregate source of GDP growth and it is lower in services relative to manufacturing. This does not mean high returns are absolutely doomed in developed economies. Since 1967, the decline in manufacturing was the biggest contributor to transition to services in the US, which led to a consistent slowdown of the economy, but the US GDP grew at an average rate of 4.57% during the late 1990s because of the dot-com boom. The growth resulted from the commercialization of the internet, and generated enormous wealth in the country, leading to the founding of giant American tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), among others. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has become one of the biggest companies in the world, surpassing some countries' entire GDPs combined, at a market cap of $1.2 trillion as of Q1, 2023. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the same story, while Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has a market cap of $88 billion as of the same quarter, with its payment system becoming one of the most popular in the world.Story continuesAdvanced economies with high levels of innovation hold some of the best investment opportunities in the world. The top global technology companies are still responsible for quarter of the growth of the S&amp;P 500 index. From 1996 to 2018, S&amp;P 500 IT Services Industry Index grew by 900% relative to 400% growth for the S&amp;P 500 overall. Why Venture Capital is Critical for Scaling Innovative Startups?The critical ingredient for innovation in a country is the health of its private equity markets, specifically, the venture capital market. If there’s a scarcity of investment, entrepreneurs coming up with efficient and improved business ideas will have a harder time putting them into action, or in this case, scale them up. Although less than 1% of startups are funded by VCs in the US, they account for 50% of the startups that go public, and 90% of the research and development in the companies that go public. In this regard, venture capital is important for scaling innovative companies. Companies in countries like the US, Israel and Germany have high access to venture capital and, therefore, are at the forefront of innovation and high returns on investment. Real EstateApart from equity and debt markets in several top countries for investment, real estate is another way to generate decent returns. The real estate markets in countries like the US, Sweden, Norway and Turkiye are booming. The United States’ commercial real estate market is especially a favorite among foreign investors, owing to greater liquidity and the potential for higher returns in comparison to the modest prime capitalization rates in some Asian and European countries. With that said, let’s move on to the 25 best countries to invest in. 25 Best Countries to Invest Inmandritoiu/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology We have defined ‘best countries to invest in’ as ones that have low market regulations, strong rule of law to protect property rights and enforce contracts, sophisticated infrastructure, strong startup scene, high access to capital and highly educated and skilled workforce. In this regard, we have selected them based on the Venture Capital and Private Equity Country Attractiveness Index of 2021 and ranked countries in ascending order of high investment attractiveness. The index bases countries’ investment attractiveness on six latent drivers, including economic activity, depth of capital markets, taxation, investor protection and corporate governance, human &amp; social environment, and entrepreneurial culture and opportunities. It further splits these drivers into subcategories. For instance, the index breaks down the 'entrepreneurial culture and opportunities' driver into five subcategories, including innovation, ease of starting a business, and scientific and corporate R&amp;D, among others. It further splits three of these subcategories into eight smaller subcategories and therefore, covers investment attractiveness of a country comprehensively. Finally, it rates countries on a scale of 1-100, with higher scores corresponding to higher investment attractiveness. To complement the list, we’ve also discussed the net inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in important countries. We’ve sourced the data for that from the World Bank.25. TaiwanInvestment Attractiveness Score: 71.9Taiwan dominates the semiconductor industry, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited (TSMC) controlling 60% of the global foundry industry as of Q4, 2022. It is regarded as one of the top countries for supply chains of electronics and semiconductors, and the government actively implements investor-friendly policies. 24. IrelandInvestment Attractiveness Score: 73.9Ireland is considered one of most business-friendly countries in the world, which is why the country attracts significant FDI relative to its GDP. In 2021, Ireland received net investment inflows that made up 19.2% of the country’s GDP. 23. MalaysiaInvestment Attractiveness Score: 74.8Malaysia is located in Southeast Asia, and the country is one of the emerging powerhouses of Asia. It ranks on the 35th position on the aggregate logistics performance index, indicating sophisticated infrastructure. 22. AustriaInvestment Attractiveness Score: 75Austria is attractive when it comes to investment for several reasons. The country offers many grants to foreign investors for tax exemption. Moreover, Austria actively promotes corporate R&amp;D. Companies in Austria are eligible for a 14% research bonus from the government. In addition, it offers credit guarantees and subsidies to stimulate innovation.21. BelgiumInvestment Attractiveness Score: 75Belgium is one of the best European countries to invest in as of late. There are no trade restrictions in Belgium, and the country is a gateway to 500 million European consumers within a radius of 500 miles. Moreover, the infrastructure in Belgium is one of the best in the world, taking the top fourth spot on the aggregate logistics performance index. 20. SpainInvestment Attractiveness Score: 76.1Spain has one of the best property markets in Europe and also has a well developed infrastructure. It has a score of 76.1 on VC and private equity country attractiveness index and ranks 18th on the aggregate logistics performance index. 19. IsraelInvestment Attractiveness Score: 76.5Israel is the most advanced country in the Middle East, and among the most advanced in all of Asia. It has a rich startup scene with lucrative returns on investment. For this reason, the country attracted 28 times more venture capital per capita than the US in 2021. In the same year, 57 Israeli startups raised an aggregate sum of $4 billion and went public. These included companies like SentinelOne, WalkMe and IronSource. Much of the country’s startup talent is concentrated in Tel Aviv. 18. New ZealandInvestment Attractiveness Score: 76.7New Zealand’s market is one of the best in high tech innovation, backed by generous fundings from the government and private equity firms. In the first two quarters of 2021, early stage investment increased by 78% from the first two quarters of 2020, and 42% out of this investment went to high tech startups. One of the most notable companies that has originated in recent years in the country is Dennisson Technologies, which is developing exo-suits with 4D materials to help people with physical disabilities.17. NorwayInvestment Attractiveness Score: 78.1Norway’s infrastructure grabs the top 20th position on the aggregate logistics performance index, and in 2021, net inflows of investment in the country made up 2.2% of its GDP. The government also incentivizes business growth and foreign investment. Norway is known for some of the biggest companies in the world, and is also a hot spot for many US companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). 16. FinlandInvestment Attractiveness Score: 78.9Finland is located in the Scandinavian region of Europe. In 2021, the FDI net-inflows in the country made up 5.5% of its GDP, indicating the attractiveness of Finland among foreign investors. Innovation in Finland’s market is 135.5% of the EU average.15. SwitzerlandInvestment Attractiveness Score: 79.5Switzerland is one of the best countries to invest in. It has one of the lowest federal corporate tax rates in the world, at 8.5%, allowing businesses to save a significant amount of money on their profits. Switzerland’s innovation performance is 142.4% of the EU average. Further, in corporate R&amp;D, the country’s performance is 227% of the EU average.14. DenmarkInvestment Attractiveness Score: 80.8Denmark has a vibrant corporate R&amp;D scene.

Despite this, attackers continued to innovate with the report showing the average time to complete a ransomware attack dropped from 2 months down to less than 4 days.According to the 2023 report, the deployment of backdoors, which allow remote access to systems, emerged as the top action by attackers last year. About 67% of those backdoor cases related to ransomware attempts, where defenders were able to detect the backdoor before ransomware was deployed. The uptick in backdoor deployments can be partially attributed to their high market value. X-Force observed threat actors selling existing backdoor access for as much as $10,000, compared to stolen credit card data, which can sell for less than $10 today.""The shift towards detection and response has allowed defenders to disrupt adversaries earlier in the attack chain - tempering ransomware's progression in the short term,"" said Charles Henderson, Head of IBM Security X-Force. ""But it's only a matter of time before today's backdoor problem becomes tomorrow's ransomware crisis. Attackers always find new ways to evade detection. Good defense is no longer enough. To break free from the never-ending rat race with attackers, businesses must drive a proactive, threat-driven security strategy.""The IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index tracks new and existing trends and attack patterns – pulling from billions of datapoints from network and endpoint devices, incident response engagements and other sources.Some of the key findings in the 2023 report include:Story continuesExtortion: Threat Actors Go-to Method. The most common impact from cyberattacks in 2022 was extortion, which was primarily achieved through ransomware or business email compromise attacks. Europe was the most targeted region for this method, representing 44% of extortion cases observed, as threat actors sought to exploit geopolitical tensions.Cybercriminals Weaponize Email Conversations. Thread hijacking saw a significant rise in 2022, with attackers using compromised email accounts to reply within ongoing conversations posing as the original participant. X-Force observed the rate of monthly attempts increase by 100% compared to 2021 data.Legacy Exploits Still Doing the Job. The proportion of known exploits relative to vulnerabilities declined 10 percentage points from 2018 to 2022, due to the fact that the number of vulnerabilities hit another record high in 2022. The findings indicate that legacy exploits enabled older malware infections such as WannaCry and Conficker to continue to exist and spread.Extortion Pressure Applied (Unevenly)Cybercriminals often target the most vulnerable industries, businesses, and regions with extortion schemes, applying high psychological pressure to force victims to pay. Manufacturing was the most extorted industry in 2022, and it was the most attacked industry for the second consecutive year. Manufacturing organizations are an attractive target for extortion, given their extremely low tolerance for down time.Ransomware is a well-known method of extortion, but threat actors are always exploring new ways to extort victims. One of the latest tactics involves making stolen data more accessible to downstream victims. By bringing customers and business partners into the mix, operators increase pressure on the breached organization. Threat actors will continue experimenting with downstream victim notifications to increase the potential costs and psychological impact of an intrusion – making it critical that businesses have a customized incident response plan that also considers the impact of an attack on downstream victims.Thread Hijacking on the RiseEmail thread hijacking activity surged last year, with monthly attempts by threat actors doubling compared to 2021 data. Over the year, X-Force found that attackers used this tactic to deliver Emotet, Qakbot, and IcedID, malicious software that often results in ransomware infections.With phishing being the leading cause of cyberattacks last year, and thread hijacking's sharp rise, it's clear that attackers are exploiting the trust placed in email. Businesses should make employees aware of thread hijacking to help reduce the risk of them falling victim.Mind the Gap: Exploit ""R&amp;D"" Lagging VulnerabilitiesThe ratio of known exploits to vulnerabilities has been declining over the last few years, down 10 percentage points since 2018. Cybercriminals already have access to more than 78,000 known exploits, making it easier to exploit older, unpatched vulnerabilities. Even after 5 years, vulnerabilities leading to WannaCry infections remain a significant threat. X-Force recently reported an 800% increase in WannaCry ransomware traffic within MSS telemetry data since April 2022. The continued use of older exploits highlights the need for organizations to refine and mature vulnerability management programs, including better understanding their attack surface and risk-based prioritization of patches.Additional findings from the 2023 report include:Phishers ""Give Up"" on Credit Card Data. The number of cybercriminals targeting credit card information in phishing kits dropped 52% in one year, indicating that attackers are prioritizing personally identifiable information such as names, emails, and home addresses, which can be sold for a higher price on the dark web or used to conduct further operations.North America Felt Brunt of Energy Attacks. Energy held its spot as the 4th most attacked industry last year, as global forces continue to affect an already tumultuous global energy trade. North American energy organizations accounted for 46% of all energy attacks observed last year, a 25% increase from 2021 levels.Asia Tops the Target List. Accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks that X-Force responded to in 2022, Asia saw more cyberattacks than any other region. Manufacturing accounted for nearly half of all cases observed in Asia last year.The report features data IBM collected globally in 2022 to deliver insightful information about the global threat landscape and inform the security community about the threats most relevant to their organizations. You can download a copy of the 2023 IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Report here.Additional sourcesRead more about the report's top findings in this IBM Security Intelligence blog.Sign up for the 2023 IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence Index webinar on Thursday, March 2, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. ET here.Schedule a consult with IBM Security X-Force.About IBM SecurityIBM Security helps secure the world's largest enterprises and governments with an integrated portfolio of security products and services, infused with dynamic AI and automation capabilities.

While the rise in inflation throughout 2022 has driven costs up materially, the space continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals and strong margins.As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, refining and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, PBF Energy and Murphy USA have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services.The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureGrowing Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 5% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Strong Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs in 2022. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Inflation in the Marketplace: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. In fact, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 79.6% in the past year.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 21.8% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 17%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 6.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.32X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.23X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.46X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA's acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 30 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 6%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 43.4%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Shares of MUSA are up 48.6% in a year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of 237.6% for the current quarter. MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 20.9%. Valued at around $59.6 billion, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Marathon Petroleum has gained 64.3% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Parsippany, NJ-based firm indicates 1,055.6% year-over-year earnings per share growth. PBF Energy beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, the average being 49%. The Zacks #2 Ranked PBF's shares are up 149.5% in a year.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.

The beer giant topped earnings per share by $0.23 and just narrowly missed on revenue estimates of 2.63 billion. The company does expect sales to increase in the low single digit range in '23 and is bullish on its lower priced brand, saying in the press release, quote, ""We have powerful core brands across our global markets that are seeing renewed strength, with Coors Light and Miller Lite in the US posting their strongest combined full year dollar share performance in a decade.""That is a really surprising revelation. Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy reiterating a buy on the stock with a $69 price target. You can see shares popping on the day more than 3%. They were up 6% earlier and have fallen a little bit. But any good news in the beer sector right now is very welcome for a battered industry, in particular, those with exposure to the hard seltzer, which is has lined.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. We saw the problems that Boston Beer has because of seltzer, obviously, last week. But Jefferies, going back to what you were just saying in terms of their price target there, they were saying that while it wasn't an extremely solid report, it was much better than feared. And we're starting to see that kind of creep in to these earnings reports, the analyst reaction over the last quarter that if you clear that bar because so much of these headwinds have been priced into a lot of these stocks, that seems to be enough, at least for now and why we're seeing that pop in shares today.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, I was going to say that. It seems like investors, analysts are really focused on the outlook, on the guidance. And if you're able to better than feared, if you're able to surpass that, you're getting rewarded.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Earning really have shifted to almost entirely the guidance.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, all the macro headwinds.DAVE BRIGGS: That's a good point, yeah.SEANA SMITH: And the Lite beer a huge hit-- who knew?]"

Results have gained from strength in core brands, particularly Coors Light and Miller Lite, as well as the above premium portfolio and contributions from its Revitalization Plan.The company’s adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share surged 61% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06.Net sales inched up 0.4% to $2,629.5 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,669 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 3.8% due to positive pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization, offset by a decline in financial volumes.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 7.1% in a year against the industry’s decline of 6.3%. Also, shares of TAP jumped more than 2% before the trading session on Feb 21. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Quarterly DetailsNet sales per hectoliter increased 11.4% on a financial-volume basis, driven by strong net pricing, a positive channel mix and a favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 5.2% to 18.7 million due to sluggishness in the America segment, stemming from a sluggish industry performance. Financial volumes declined 6.9% to 19.7 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA and APAC volumes.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) advanced 52.5% year over year to $328.6 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT rose 51.1%.Segmental InformationMolson Coors operates under the following geographical segments.Americas: Net sales in the segment decreased 0.7% to $2,131.3 million on a reported basis but rose 0.4% on a constant-currency basis due to favorable pricing and the positive sales mix, offset by a decline in financial volumes. Financial volumes dipped 10.5% year over year on reduced Canada shipments and an 11.2% decrease in U.S. domestic shipments.Brand volume for the segment dropped 6.6% on a 6.8% decline in the United States, owing to softer industry performance and a 5% dip in Canada due to the weak beer industry and a 6.9% decline in Latin America.Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand volume basis, rose 12.1% on a constant-currency basis due to a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 31% and 30% on a reported and constant-currency basis, respectively, to $346.5 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expenses, offset by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs.EMEA &amp; APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) grew 6.2% to $503.2 million and improved 20.3% on a constant-currency basis. Higher constant-currency sales resulted from financial volume growth, favorable pricing and a positive sales mix. Net sales per hectoliter (on a brand volume basis) for the segment advanced 14.9% on a constant-currency basis, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing.The segment’s financial volumes rose 4.7% due to growth in the above-premium portfolio. Brand volume decreased 1% due to volume declines resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, somewhat offset by volume growth.The segment’s underlying EBT increased significantly from $4.6 million to $28.1 million on a reported basis and improved $23.7 on a constant-currency basis, driven by higher financial volumes, favorable pricing and sales mix, which offset cost inflation, particularly in materials, transportation and energy costs.Story continuesOther Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $600 million.

You can skip our overview of Bill Miller and his investment philosophy and go directly to the 5 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Legendary Bill Miller.Bill Miller is the founder, current chairman, and chief investment officer of Miller Value Partners LLC. Miller has been in the investment industry for more than three decades and has earned a reputation as one of the most successful investors of all time.Bill Miller was born in 1950 in Laurinburg, North Carolina. He earned a degree in economics from Washington and Lee University in 1972 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1974. Miller received his CFA designation in 1986 and worked in the investment industry for more than a decade before starting his own investment management firm, Miller Value Partners LLC. The firm is based in Baltimore, Maryland, and as of Q4 2022, had a portfolio worth of over $1.5 billion.Miller Value Partners is known for its value-based investment philosophy, which is based on the principles of value investing popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. The firm believes that the stock market is inefficient and frequently misprices stocks, creating opportunities for astute investors to earn high returns.15 Best Value Stocks to Buy According to Legendary Bill MillerIn an interview with CNBC in January 2023, Miller expressed indifference towards the ongoing volatility in the S&amp;P 500 and reiterated his theory about investment in undervalued stocks. He believes it is up to the individual where they see value in the stock market.He compared his investment approach with that of John Hamilton, who, back in 1939, created the Hamilton Drug Funds when Hitler invaded Poland. John borrowed $300 and made his broker purchase every stock on the New York stock exchange for a dollar or less. This went on to form the crux of the wealth he generated in the future from this trade. Many of the companies he invested in while standing on the mountain of bankruptcy fared well as an investment. This is largely similar to Bill Miller’s investment strategy, where he chooses to look for potential and the value a company can generate in the future rather than where it stands today.Story continuesRecently Miller remarked on his short trade on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). He pointed out that the company’s market cap of $380 billion (at the time of Miller's remarks), 7-fold higher than General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), is not justified, given that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a car manufacturer instead of a technology firm. On the other hand, the legendary investor is bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and has holdings in both these companies.Our MethodologyFor this list, we have picked the top 15 holdings of Miller Value Partners as of Q4 2022.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has lost 2.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, United is expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share, indicating a change of +116% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +229.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.34 indicates a change of +12.6% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for United.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For United, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +51.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.77 billion and $55.18 billion estimates indicate +17.4% and +4.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $12.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.4%. EPS of $2.46 for the same period compares with -$1.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.39%. The EPS surprise was +18.84%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Costco COST and Target TGT.Previewing Walmart, Target and Retail Sector EarningsWalmart shares have lagged during the market's bounce off the October 2022 lows, but have otherwise been stalwart performers in the broader market sell-off that got underway at the start of 2022. You can see this in the chart below that shows the one-year performance of Walmart relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (green line) and the Zacks Retail sector (red line).Since the October lows, Walmart shares are up +11.3% while the S&amp;P 500 index has gained +13.2%.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart's 'value orientation' allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers 'trade down' during times of 'economic stress'. This almost 'staple' aspect of Walmart's business can also be seen in the recent stock market behavior of Costco and others.Target shares stand out for their underperformance, but that is more reflective of management's missteps in executing in the post-Covid environment. Also, relative to Walmart and Costco, Target has a relatively smaller grocery business and has relatively more exposure to discretionary spending categories.Walmart is expected to report essentially flat earnings on +4.4% higher revenues in its quarterly report before the market's open on Tuesday, February 21st. The market liked what it saw in the company's last two quarterly reports on November 15th and August 16th, 2022.Target will be releasing its quarterly results a week later on February 28th. Target shares were down big in response to each of the preceding three quarterly releases, with the May 2022 release particularly notable. Analysts have generally lowered their Target estimates since the company's last quarterly report on November 16th, while the same for Walmart has been modestly positive.Story continuesWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -48.9% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues, with 64.7% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon's -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group's weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers starting to report results this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.This Week's Reporting DocketWe have more than 600 companies on deck to report results this week, including 60 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Nvidia, Alibaba, eBay, Home Depot and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 17th, we now have Q4 results from 407 S&amp;P 500 members or 81.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +5.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.3% beating revenue estimates.There is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn't change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared. You can see this in the chart below that shows how estimates for the current period (2023 Q1) have evolved in recent weeks.Please note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.Please note that the $1.915 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index 'EPS' of $215.89, down from $216.09 last week and the $216.18 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.With the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed's tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is a fairly reassuring outcome.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Making Sense of Earnings Estimate Revisions for Q1 FY23 and Beyond Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase CSX's shares on or after the 27th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.11 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.40 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, CSX has a trailing yield of approximately 1.3% on its current stock price of $30.59. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether CSX has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for CSX Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. CSX paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 24% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that CSX's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That explains why we're not overly excited about CSX's flat earnings over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share. CSX is retaining more than three-quarters of its earnings and has a history of generating some growth in earnings. We think this is a reasonable combination.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. CSX has delivered an average of 7.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.To Sum It UpIs CSX an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The company has barely grown earnings per share over this time, but at least it's paying out a decently low percentage of its earnings and cashflow as dividends. This could suggest management is reinvesting in future growth opportunities. Generally we like to see both low payout ratios and strong earnings per share growth, but CSX is halfway there. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks CSX is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for CSX that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

246,6b92866a-589b-3163-9e42-d912244f62af,ROST,2023-02-22,Ross Stores' (NASDAQ:ROST) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-nasdaq-rost-five-112604671.html,1677065164,STORY,['ROST'],"[The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) share price is up 45% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. It's also good to see a healthy gain of 28% in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Ross Stores There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Ross Stores managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.7% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 8% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Ross Stores' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Ross Stores, it has a TSR of 52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ross Stores shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 9% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.13 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores?For Ross Stores, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.16%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +23.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

249,c74b86a5-f39c-3c08-8034-fb7131aea852,ADI,2023-02-22,What Makes Analog Devices (ADI) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-analog-devices-adi-strong-170005457.html,1676998805,STORY,['ADI'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Analog Devices (ADI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Analog Devices currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ADI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this semiconductor maker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For ADI, shares are up 7.98% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is down 0.28% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.59% compares favorably with the industry's 9.02% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Analog Devices have increased 17.5% over the past quarter, and have gained 20.17% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.29% and -4.71%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ADI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ADI is currently averaging 3,483,264 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ADI.Over the past two months, 10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ADI's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.76 to $10.38 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ADI is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Analog Devices on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to FFO of $2.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -0.64%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this communications tower operator would post FFO of $3.04 per share when it actually produced FFO of $3.10, delivering a surprise of 1.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.SBA Communications , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $686.09 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.63%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $595.26 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.SBA Communications shares have added about 0.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for SBA Communications?While SBA Communications has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for SBA Communications: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $3.14 on $676.41 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.75 on $2.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Clipper Realty Inc.

SBA’s Board of Directors has appointed Brendan Cavanagh, SBA’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to succeed Mr. Stoops as President and CEO, at which time Mr. Cavanagh shall also be appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Stoops shall remain on the Company’s Board of Directors, and upon his retirement shall assume the position of non-executive Chairman of the Board. Steven Bernstein, SBA’s founder and current Chairman of the Board of Directors, will continue to serve on the Board, and Jack Langer will continue in his role as lead independent director. The Company intends to appoint its next Chief Financial Officer later this year.Brendan Cavanagh joined SBA in February 1998 after spending several years as a CPA in the assurance practice of Arthur Andersen. During his 25-year career at SBA, he has served in a number of positions of increasing responsibility, including in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, as Vice President - Site Administration and as Chief Accounting Officer, prior to becoming the Company’s Chief Financial Officer in 2008. During Mr. Cavanagh’s tenure as CFO, SBA’s total revenues have grown by 555% and its enterprise value has expanded from $6 billion to $43 billion.""It has been a tremendous privilege to work side by side with Jeff from the very early days of the wireless infrastructure industry through a period of significant growth to the current state of SBA as a top-performing, multinational company. I am extremely thankful to Jeff for his guidance and support over the last quarter century,"" said Brendan Cavanagh, the Company’s next President and CEO. ""I am also very excited for the future of SBA. I see many opportunities to support our customers in their continuing efforts to expand the capabilities and depth of their wireless networks in order to meet the constantly growing demand for enhanced wireless services. SBA’s strong foundation and talented leadership team position us well to be a key contributor to our customers’ future success. I am deeply honored to be entrusted with the leadership of such an extraordinary organization, and I look forward to the next chapter for SBA.""Story continuesJeff Stoops joined SBA in March, 1997, initially as Executive Vice President and General Counsel, with the primary charge of leading SBA’s transition from a services provider to the U.S. wireless carrier industry to an independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. SBA acquired its first towers in June, 1997. Mr. Stoops later served as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, including during its initial public offering in June, 1999, and later President, before being appointed CEO effective January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2022, SBA was operating in 16 countries, and owned close to 40,000 tower sites. Mr. Stoops is the longest-serving public company CEO in the history of the global wireless tower industry. During Mr. Stoops’ tenure as CEO, through December 31, 2022, SBA has delivered annualized total shareholder returns of 16% and annualized growth in enterprise value of 17%.""I am extremely blessed and fortunate to have had the opportunity to lead SBA and work with world-class colleagues in a remarkably dynamic and successful industry"" commented Jeff Stoops, President and CEO. ""I am very proud of the industry we have shaped, the customers we have served, the shareholders we have rewarded and the employees and communities we have benefitted. I want to give a heartfelt thanks to all who helped me on this remarkable journey, which continues. The time has come to turn the leadership of SBA over to the next generation. I am very excited about the future of SBA under the leadership of Brendan and the rest of our strong executive team. Brendan has been my partner and right-hand for many years, and during that time Brendan has been intimately involved in everything of importance for our Company, including managing our strong balance sheet and capital allocation program. He possesses the skills, character and vision to lead SBA to new heights in an ever-changing industry. The Board, Brendan and I have been preparing Brendan to succeed me for some time, and I will retire with the confidence and comfort in the knowledge that SBA will be in strong and capable hands. We expect the transition will be smooth and seamless, and I look forward to continuing my long relationship with Brendan and SBA as Chairman of the Board of Directors.""Steven Bernstein, current Chairman of the Board of SBA, said ""Jeff has had a tremendous impact on our company and industry. The Board is grateful for his leadership over two decades, a period of time driven by clear and focused vision, outstanding operational execution and integrity. During that time our shareholders have been rewarded handsomely, our customers well-served and the lives of our employees and communities improved. Given the importance of finding the right successor for Jeff, our Board approached this change of leadership in a very diligent manner. Working closely with Jeff, the Board identified Brendan as his successor and is implementing a leadership succession process that will benefit all of our constituents.

The distribution is payable March 24, 2023 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2023.""We had a very solid finish to 2022, producing record annual results on a number of metrics and positioning us well for 2023,"" commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The US market remains active, with our largest US customers expected to all stay relatively busy with additional network deployment in 2023. We believe domestic activity will remain solid through 2023 and perhaps beyond, given the size and scope of our customers’ 5G deployment plans and our belief that much 5G work remains to be done on our assets. International results were strong as well in the fourth quarter, and gross leasing demand is expected to remain solid internationally. Last year was a remarkable year in terms of portfolio growth and balance sheet management. We grew our portfolio materially by 15%, providing us with additional growth assets in several markets. We were still able to end the year with our balance sheet in great shape, below the low end of our target net debt/Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio as we used AFFO to reduce floating-rate debt in a materially higher interest rate environment. All of these favorable results allowed us to increase AFFO per share by double-digit percentages in the fourth quarter and for the full 2022 fiscal year over comparable prior periods. We are extremely confident and excited about our future, so much so that we have just approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of approximately 20%. While a substantial increase, this dividend on an annual basis represents only approximately 27% of our AFFO in our 2023 Outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and/or additional floating-rate leverage reduction while interest rates remain higher. We believe we offer our shareholders very favorable prospects for additional value creation.""Story continuesOperating ResultsThe table below details select financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and comparisons to the prior year period.% ChangeexcludingQ4 2022Q4 2021$ Change% ChangeFX (1)Consolidated($ in millions, except per share amounts)Site leasing revenue$609.6$539.4$70.213.0%12.6%Site development revenue76.555.920.636.9%36.9%Tower cash flow (1)485.9434.151.811.9%11.5%Net income102.648.953.7109.8%47.2%Earnings per share - diluted0.940.440.50113.6%49.2%Adjusted EBITDA (1)460.7409.151.612.6%12.2%AFFO (1)340.7310.829.99.6%8.9%AFFO per share (1)3.122.810.3111.0%10.3%(1)See the reconciliations and other disclosures under ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" later in this press releaseTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $686.1 million compared to $595.3 million in the prior year period, an increase of 15.3%.

Regulators are focused on ensuring that companies prioritize their financial and operational resilience while continuing to provide support to their customers. The immediate future will require close attention to disruptive economic factors, and lenders will need to demonstrate to supervisors how they are managing credit risks. Insurance companies and investment funds may also experience pressure related to credit in their portfolios, and may need to strengthen their credit teams if the number of defaults and corporate restructurings increases.Despite the challenges faced by several wealth management firms in 2022, the prevailing market conditions could persuade hesitant sellers to yield to larger banks that can absorb the escalating compliance expenses and use their current technology platforms to promote the digitization initiative that many smaller private banks have not been able to achieve with their current infrastructure.In the last two years, the financial services sector has proven its capacity to effectively handle extraordinary levels of ambiguity. Whether in real estate, insurance, investment management, or banking and capital markets, financial service providers worldwide responded to the pandemic with exceptional resilience and flexibility, assisting individuals, businesses, and governments in their recovery efforts.

It declared a full-year dividend of $4.92 per share, down from 2021's record payout of $10.40 per share.Its shares were down 2.2% at 0817 GMT.Strict COVID-19 curbs in top steel producer China curtailed economic activity last year, dragging down iron ore prices from lofty levels a year earlier.But the world's top iron ore producer said Chinese consumption showed signs of rebounding.""It is very positive that China now also comes out of COVID lockdowns ... and we are quietly confident that (China's) demand will be a stabilising factor for the world economy in 2023,"" Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm told reporters.China, the world's second-biggest economy, in January re-opened its borders and eased quarantine requirements for travellers after three years of tight controls, and is putting in place policies to boost its sagging economy.Rio Tinto lowered its capital investments guidance for 2023 to $8 billion from $8-9 billion, while raising its estimates for 2024 and 2025 to $9-10 billion.The estimates include around $3 billion a year for growth capital, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Cunningham, as the miner moves to ramp up projects, including Guinea's vast iron ore deposit Simandou, Argentina's lithium asset Rincon and the underground expansion of its massive Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia.Story continuesOn Tuesday, rival BHP Group reported a steeper-than-expected 32% fall in first-half profit but also flagged a brightening outlook in China.Rio Tinto last year earned an average realised price of just $106.10 per dry metric tonne (dmt) of iron ore, down from $143.80 per dmt in 2021.It maintained its production and unit cost guidance for 2023.Additional investments to ramp up production at the Gudai-Darri mine in Pilbara, Australia, along with higher diesel prices and labour costs, resulted in Pilbara unit cash costs rising to $21.30 per tonne in 2022, Rio said.""Similar to the rest of the industry, compressing margins and rising capex will place pressure on free cash flow generation,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said.GROWTH DILEMMADespite the vast volumes of copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt needed for the transition to a lower carbon economy, major mining companies have limited plans to develop mines that take several years to turn a profit.Some have preferred to grow through acquisitions, with BHP making a $6.5 billion cash offer for copper and gold producer OZ Minerals.Others are investing in projects belonging to smaller developers.Rio last year suffered a setback to its ambition to become a significant lithium producer, when the Serbian government revoked licences for its Jadar project after massive protests sparked by environmental concerns over the planned mine.""We have a lot going on, mostly are organic opportunities, except Rincon which was our first acquisition for a decade and then followed that by taking TRQ private,"" Stausholm said.""So we look at it asset by asset - would we like to grow in lithium? Yes. On the other hand, it's very expensive right now.""""I'm not looking at big transformative M&amp;A changes at the moment.

Over that period we have taken decisive action to improve, simplify and organize our business as needed to maximize returns, minimize risk and position Aimco for continued growth.Aimco’s mission is to make real estate investments, primarily focused on the multifamily sector within targeted US markets, where outcomes are enhanced through our human capital and substantial value is created for investors, teammates, and the communities in which we operate. Our capital allocation is balanced between a geographically diversified portfolio of stabilized, cash flowing, apartment properties and the investment in (and management of) dynamic real estate development projects located in South Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro Area and Colorado’s Front Range. We benefit from a senior management team with an average of more than 20 years of experience in the apartment investment, finance and development industry; including regional leaders who are experts in each of their local markets.Today, I am excited to report on the team’s many accomplishments during 2022 and to highlight our plans for the year ahead.During 2022, Aimco made accretive investments in our development projects and pipeline by completing construction on, and leasing up, $669 million of apartment properties. We also secured high-quality future development opportunities in our target markets, adding the potential to construct more than 3,600 apartment homes and approximately 450K square feet of commercial use.Story continuesIn addition to investing in future growth opportunities we acquired $25 million of Aimco shares, at an average cost of $7.21 per share.We took advantage of strong valuations early in the year and monetized a sizeable portion of our assets, exiting investments valued at nearly $1 billion, including three stabilized apartment communities and four recently completed development projects at a weighted average NOI cap rate of 3.9%.Our portfolio of stabilized apartment communities delivered strong growth as evidenced by average monthly revenue up by more than $200 per home, NOI margins expanding by 220 basis points, and NOI increasing by 14.2% to over $94 million.We proactively fortified our balance sheet by refinancing or retiring more than $1 billion of near-term liabilities, eliminated substantially all of our floating rate exposure, and nearly doubled our average term to maturity. In addition, we entered into a strategic partnership with Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation to provide Limited Partner equity capital for up to $1 billion of future Aimco-led multifamily development projects.Finally, we committed to important changes to our corporate governance provisions that will bring us to a best-in-class standard within the REIT industry and we achieved an all-time Aimco record employee engagement score of 4.5 out of 5 stars.2022 proved to be a good year for Aimco but our focus is on the road ahead.Notwithstanding a higher interest rate environment and diverging views regarding the likelihood, and relative severity, of an economic downturn, the rental housing sector has proven quite enduring over time and a lingering supply and demand imbalance provides additional support to the Aimco strategy.During 2023, Aimco will continue our in-progress development projects, invest in the advancement of planning and entitlement efforts related to certain of our pipeline assets, asset manage our portfolio of stabilized apartment properties, look to reduce our exposure to alternative assets and maintain our strong balance sheet.Our active development and redevelopment projects have a total planned investment value of $815 million (requiring approximately $45 million of additional Aimco capital to complete) and are currently in various stages of construction and lease-up. When stabilized they are forecasted to produce approximately $55 million of NOI, ahead of our original expectations due to market level rent growth, resulting in an expected NOI yield on cost of 6.8% for this portfolio of investments.Our future development pipeline totals approximately 14 million square feet and has the potential to deliver approximately 6,500 new apartment homes and 1.7 million square feet of commercial space over the next ten years or so. These opportunities are high quality and well located with approximately 80% of our pipeline focused in Southeast Florida, 17% in Colorado’s Front Range and 3% in the Washington D.C. Metro Area. Although we do not anticipate any new construction starts during 2023, we are advancing planning and entitlement efforts prudently such that incremental investment adds value independent of a decision to commence construction. During the year we plan to invest between $20 and $25 million to advance certain pipeline projects.Beyond 2023, Aimco targets that between $1 billion and $2 billion of active development and redevelopment projects will be underway at any point in time, with the range driven by market conditions, the specific timing of project starts and completions and the potential to fully monetize certain development opportunities prior to vertical construction. Aimco equity invested in these projects is expected to range between 10% and 15% of the total development costs.With regard to the timing and funding of Aimco’s future development starts it is important to note that: 1) we will be guided by the projected risk adjusted returns on Aimco’s equity as compared to alternative uses of capital, 2) Aimco’s net cost to carry our current development pipeline is approximately $2 million annually due to the positive cashflow from the current improvements on our Brickell assemblage and the use of low cost options, and 3) we currently have embedded equity within our development pipeline that exceeds what is required to fully build-out the pipeline given our plan to finance projects through construction debt and joint venture equity. To provide more clarity on the depth, timing, and value potential within our development pipeline we have included a new schedule in this earnings release.Our portfolio of over 5,500 stabilized apartment homes is diversified by geography and generates average monthly revenue per home of $2,170 (generally in line with local market averages) and our new customers in 2022 have median annual household incomes of more than $110,000. Our stabilized portfolio is expected to produce NOI in 2023 that is 5% to 7% higher than the prior year.Turning to acquisitions and dispositions, given the forementioned depth and quality of our development pipeline, we are not planning any new acquisitions in 2023. Similarly, we do not forecast any real estate dispositions during the year but continue to advance plans to monetize our position in Parkmerced given various accretive uses of that capital, including share repurchases, reducing leverage, and investing in the pipeline.Our balance sheet is solid. Aimco’s property debt is primarily fixed rate loans on stabilized properties with an average term to maturity of 8.2 years and refunding requirements of less than $5 million in 2023. As we look to the most accretive risk-adjusted use of capital we may opportunistically pay down certain higher cost debt when prudent.The Aimco team remains our most important asset and I am thankful for the team's good results, camaraderie, and commitment to excellence. As we continue to simplify our business and optimize results, we are narrowing our focus and plan to close our California office during the year. We will retain a full-time presence in our target investment markets of Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro area, and Colorado's Front Range.As always, the future is far from certain. However, Aimco’s strategic focus on rental housing and the specific actions taken over the past two years have positioned us to withstand market turbulence and given us the ability to prudently allocate capital to new opportunities should they be presented.Above all else, the Aimco management team and Board remain steadfast in our commitment to actively explore all paths that would allow stockholders to realize the full value of their investment.I thank you for your interest in Aimco!Wes PowellChief Executive OfficerFinancial Results and Recent HighlightsNet income attributable to common stockholders per share, on a fully dilutive basis, was $(1.34) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income per share of $(0.01) for the same period in 2021, due primarily to a non-cash impairment charge related to the Parkmerced mezzanine investment.As of February 14, 2023, total shareholder return (""TSR"") since the December 15, 2020 separation from AIR Communities was 40.5% and year-to-date was 7.7%.In the fourth quarter, Aimco and its joint venture partner began construction on the 220-apartment home development at Strathmore Square in Bethesda, Maryland.In 2022 and through February 14, 2023, Aimco has repurchased more than 4.2 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of approximately $7.24 per share.Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenue and NOI from Aimco’s Stabilized Operating Properties were up 9.5% and 10.0%, respectively, year over year, with average revenue per apartment home of $2,170, up $215 year over year.Value Add, Opportunistic &amp; Alternative Investments:Development and RedevelopmentAimco generally seeks development and redevelopment opportunities where barriers to entry are high, target customers can be clearly defined, and Aimco has a comparative advantage over others in the market. Aimco’s Value Add and Opportunistic investments may also target portfolio acquisitions, operational turnarounds, and re-entitlements.As of December 31, 2022, Aimco had five active development and redevelopment projects located in four U.S. markets, in varying phases of construction and lease-up. These projects remain on track, as measured by construction budget and lease-up metrics. During the fourth quarter, Aimco invested $72.1 million in development and redevelopment activities. Updates include:In Miami, Florida, construction is nearing completion and fully renovated apartment homes are being leased at The Hamilton. Demand for rental housing in Southeast Florida remains robust, especially for unique luxury properties such as The Hamilton. The building welcomed its first residents in October 2022 and at year end the building was 50% occupied at rental rates significantly ahead of our underwritten projections. As of February 15, 2023, 75% of the building’s 276 units were leased or pre-leased.In Bethesda, Maryland, construction began on the first phase of Strathmore Square which will contain 220 highly tailored apartment homes when complete in 2025. This infill project is located adjacent to the Grosvenor-Strathmore Metro station and the Strathmore Performing Arts Campus, and is 1.5 miles from The National Institutes of Health main campus. Funding for the $164.0 million project is fully secured with Aimco’s equity commitment projected to be $31.5 million.In upper northwest Washington D.C., construction at Upton Place continues on schedule and on budget. The neighboring apartment community, City Ridge, is leasing up well and at rents that provide a positive indicator for Upton Place. Aimco plans to start pre-leasing Upton’s 689 apartment homes during the summer of 2023 in anticipation of initial delivery in the fourth quarter of 2023. To date, 80% of the project's 105K square feet of retail space has been leased.In Corte Madera, California, construction is ongoing at Oak Shore where 16 luxury single family rental homes and eight accessory dwelling units are being developed. The Marin County submarket is significantly supply constrained with for-sale starter homes generally priced near $2 million. Aimco expects to deliver the first homes in the third quarter with pre-leasing efforts having begun in the first quarter of 2023.In Aurora, Colorado, The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club, a 106-key boutique hotel and event center, is slated for completion at the end of March 2023. As the only ‘on campus’ accommodations, The Benson will serve the surrounding Anschutz Medical Campus which includes The University of Colorado Medical School, UC Health Hospital, Children’s Hospital Colorado, The Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center and the burgeoning Fitzsimons Innovation Community.Alternative InvestmentsAimco’s current alternative investments are primarily those investments originated prior to the separation from AIR Communities and include a mezzanine loan secured by a stabilized multifamily property with an option to participate in future multifamily development, as well as three passive equity investments. Over time, we plan to significantly reduce capital allocated to these investments. Updates include:The borrower on Aimco’s mezzanine loan, which is secured by the Parkmerced stabilized multifamily property plus phases two through nine of the site's future development opportunity, remains current on its first mortgage obligations. In the fourth quarter, given the decline in the underlying collateral value, Aimco recorded a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the value of the mezzanine investment to $158.6 million.Aimco recently entered into an agreement to sell the mezzanine loan for $167.5 million. Closing on the sale of the loan is subject to a reasonable due diligence period and certain approvals and, as such, is not guaranteed. If the sale is closed, Aimco expects to monetize the $1.5 billion notional swaption purchased in conjunction with the mezzanine loan investment to protect against future interest rate increases. These transactions could produce approximately $220 million of gross proceeds, representing a 75% recovery of the initial investments, and achieves Aimco's target to reduce capital allocated to alternative investments. Aimco expects to use proceeds on other accretive uses of capital including share repurchases, reducing leverage, and investing in its pipeline.Investment ActivityAimco is focused on growing the business, and delivering strong investment returns, through development and redevelopment activities, funded primarily through third-party capital. Updates include:In December 2022, Aimco closed on the $1.8 million purchase of land pursuant to one of its controlled options for multifamily development on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado. Aimco has begun planning for the next multifamily development on the site which is slated to include approximately 285 apartment homes.In February 2023, Aimco entered into an option agreement with the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority. If exercised, the option allows for the long-term lease of 4.8 acres of land located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado that can accommodate approximately 850K square feet of commercial life science development built out over multiple phases. The option's annual cost is approximately $0.5 million.In December, Aimco's joint venture in Fort Lauderdale, Florida monetized a portion of its investment by closing on the sale of one of three land parcels it acquired in the first quarter of 2022 for development along Broward Avenue. The 0.8-acre land parcel was sold for $18.3 million, approximately double the original purchase price per acre.Operating Property ResultsAimco owns a diversified portfolio of operating apartment communities located in eight major U.S. markets with average rents in line with local market averages.Aimco’s operating properties produced solid results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.Fourth QuarterFULL YEARStabilized Operating PropertiesYear-over-YearSequentialYear-over-Year($ in millions)20222021Variance3Q 2022Variance20222021VarianceAverage Daily Occupancy97.4%98.8%(1.4)%96.0%1.4%97.4%98.0%(0.6%)Revenue, before utility reimbursements$35.2$32.19.5%$34.71.4%$135.2$122.210.6%Expenses, net of utility reimbursements9.99.28.3%10.2(2.9%)40.839.63.0%Net operating income (NOI)25.223.010.0%24.53.2%94.482.714.2%*Excluded from the table above is one, 40-unit apartment community that Aimco’s ownership includes a partnership share.Revenue in the fourth quarter 2022 was $35.2 million, up 9.5% year-over-year, resulting from a $215 increase in average monthly revenue per apartment home to $2,170, offset by a 140-basis point decrease in Average Daily Occupancy to 97.4%.New lease rents increased 9.5% and Aimco retained 56.7% of residents whose leases were expiring during the quarter at rents 22.5% higher, on average, than the previous lease.The median annual household income of new residents was more than $120,000 in the fourth quarter 2022, representing a rent to income ratio of 19.2%.Expenses in the fourth quarter 2022 were up 8.3% due to higher real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance. Operating expenses, before real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance were down 0.5%.Net operating income in the fourth quarter 2022 was $25.2 million, up 10.0% year-over-year.Other Real Estate OperationsAimco also owns one commercial office building that is part of an assemblage with an adjacent apartment building.Strong leasing momentum continued at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, a waterfront office building in Miami, Florida, owned as part of a larger assemblage with substantial development potential. In 2022, Aimco executed leases on over 96,000 square feet of office space, at rates per square foot more than 10% higher than leases executed in the same period of 2021. At the end of 2022, the building was 86% occupied, up from 80% at the same time last year. Leases within the building have been executed on terms of less than four years or contain redevelopment provisions as needed to maximize the value of the underlying development rights.Balance Sheet and Financing ActivityAimco is highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including having at all times ample liquidity. As of December 31, 2022, Aimco had access to $379.8 million, including $206.5 million of cash on hand, $23.3 million of restricted cash, and the capacity to borrow up to $150.0 million on its revolving credit facility.Aimco’s net leverage as of December 31, 2022, was as follows:as of December 31, 2022Proportionate, $ in thousandsAmountWeighted Avg.Maturity (Yrs.)Total non-recourse fixed rate debt$780,3558.2Total non-recourse floating rate debt156,4792.1Total non-recourse construction loan debt118,2303.2Cash and restricted cash(229,766)Net Leverage$825,298As of December 31, 2022, 98% of Aimco's total debt was either fixed rate or hedged with interest rate cap protection. Aimco's interest hedging instruments, purchased to provide protection against increases in interest rates, were valued at $62.3 million versus a cost basis of approximately $18.0 million.Debt RepaymentsAimco and its joint venture partner used the majority of the proceeds generated from the sale of the development lot on Broward Avenue in Fort Lauderdale to reduce the principal amount of the floating rate land loan from $40.0 million to $22.9 million.Construction FinancingIn December, Aimco's joint venture for the development of Strathmore Square completed financing for the project which includes a $94 million construction loan with interest accruing at a rate of one-month Term SOFR, capped at 4.00%, plus 275 basis points with a floor of 5.00%, a $32.5 million mezzanine position accruing at 13%, and fixed-rate financing through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund for $6.5 million.

For the full year 2022, Aimco repurchased 3.5 million shares of its common stock for $24.9 million, with a weighted average price of $7.21 per share. Aimco repurchased an additional 0.8 million shares in 2023, through February 14, at a weighted average price of $7.41 per share.2023 Outlook2023 Outlook$ in millions (except per share amounts), Square Feet in millions2023 Full Year ForecastFull Year 2022Net income (loss) per share – diluted$(0.33) - $(0.23)$0.49Active Developments and RedevelopmentsTotal Direct Costs of Projects Underway [1]$815$870Direct Project Costs$165 - $185$209Other Capitalized Costs$30 - $31$36Construction Loan Draws$150 - $170$91JV Partner Equity Funding$0$31AIV Equity Funding~$45$122Pipeline ProjectsPipeline Size Gross Square Feet [1]14.012.6Pipeline Size Multifamily Units [1]7,6406,118Pipeline Size Commercial Sq Ft [1]1.70.8Planning Costs (AIV Share)$20 - $25$18Real Estate TransactionsAcquisitionsNone$153DispositionsNone$936Operating PropertiesRevenue Growth, before utility reimbursements5.0% - 7.0%10.6%Operating Expense Growth, net of utility reimbursements5.25% - 7.25%3.0%Net Operating Income Growth5.0% - 7.0%14.2%Recurring Capital Expenditures$11 - $13$12General and Administrative$33 - $35$40LeverageInterest Expense, net of capitalization$39 - $42$74[1] Includes land or leasehold value, calculated as the quarterly average.Active Developments and RedevelopmentsPlanned incremental direct capital investment in development and redevelopment projects during 2023 is expected to be between $165 - $185 million. Aimco's incremental equity investment is expected to be approximately $45 million with the remainder funded through previously committed third party debt and equity. Aimco expects to have projects with $815 million of total direct costs, inclusive of land or leasehold value, underway during 2023 and expects those projects to produce annual NOI of approximately $55 million once fully stabilized.In 2023, Aimco plans to:Complete the construction and lease up of The Hamilton with NOI stabilization projected to occur in 2024;Deliver initial single family rental homes and begin the lease-up of Oak Shore with NOI stabilization projected to occur in 2025;Deliver initial apartment homes and begin the lease-up of Upton Place with NOI stabilization projected to occur in 2026; andComplete construction and welcome its first guests to The Benson Hotel and Faculty Club with NOI stabilization projected to occur in 2026.Pipeline Development and Redevelopment ProjectsAimco's future pipeline is located in Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro Area and Colorado's Front Range. The pipeline is comprised of land assemblages that provide the opportunity for phased multifamily and mixed-use development, real estate where the development opportunity is worth more than the capitalized value of the current income producing assets, and Aimco-controlled options that provide opportunity to access future development rights. Aimco's current pipeline offers the opportunity to construct approximately 14 million square feet over the next ten years or so.While Aimco maintains the optionality for future development, advances entitlement, and secures third party financing, the costs associated with carrying these assets is mitigated by the diversified nature of the pipeline assets, in particular the income generated by the operating assets at the Brickell assemblage and the low-cost options on future development at Strathmore Square and on the Anschutz Medical Campus.Aimco expects to invest between $20 million and $25 million to advance planning and entitlement of certain of its future development pipeline projects during 2023. Aimco currently forecasts no new development starts in 2023. If pre-development schedules progress favorably, market and economic conditions support underwriting with NOI yield spreads of 150-200 bps above expected cap rates and we are able to secure favorable third-party financing, Aimco may accelerate the start of certain pipeline projects and begin construction activities late during the fourth quarter of 2023.Real Estate TransactionsIn 2023, Aimco does not plan for any acquisitions that will increase the size of its current development pipeline. Broadly, Aimco does not predict or guide to future transactions but continuously weighs the potential use of proceeds against the source.Operating PropertiesAimco's stabilized operating portfolio includes properties with rents, on average, in line with local market rents, generally considered class B apartment communities. These properties are primarily located in suburban residential areas of Boston and Chicago with other select assets in Manhattan and Southeast Florida, and single assets in Denver, Nashville, Atlanta, and San Francisco. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Aimco's portfolio generated average monthly revenue per home of $2,170 and new residents had rent-to-income ratios of 19.2%, on average.In 2023, Aimco forecasts revenues to grow between 5.0% and 7.0%, and operating expenses to increase between 5.25% and 7.25%, resulting in NOI increasing between 5.0% and 7.0%.Leasing activity from 2022 will contribute approximately 5% to Aimco's stabilized operating portfolio revenue growth in 2023 with approximately +150 bps impact from 2023 lease transactions, at the midpoint of guidance, assuming flat occupancy year over year and -50 bps impact from other revenue items. Additionally, Aimco will add one property to its stabilized operating portfolio in 2023 that will have minimal impact on growth.General and AdministrativeAs Aimco announced in the fall of 2022, it is now targeting real estate investment in just three markets, Southeast Florida, the Washington D.C. Metro Area, and Colorado's Front Range. Aimco is planning to exit the California market over time and has eliminated its satellite offices and reduced its regional offices to only its three target markets.Aimco expects G&amp;A costs in 2023 to be reduced by more than 10%, due to the narrowed geographic focus discussed above and the expiration of the consulting services agreement with AIR Communities that was put in place as part of the separation of the two companies in December 2020.LeverageAimco uses leverage to capitalize its real estate portfolio and construction activities so that Aimco preserves liquidity and so that Aimco equity is invested in diverse projects and markets, mitigating concentration risk. Aimco prefers non-recourse property-level financing with fixed, or rate-capped floating interest rates. In addition, Aimco has a secured revolving credit facility providing additional liquidity.In 2023, Aimco expects fixed rate and floating rate property loan balances to be in line with ending balances for 2022 and does not anticipate needing to draw on its $150 million revolving credit facility. Aimco does plan to draw between $150 and $170 million on in-place construction and mezzanine loans for planned costs related to active developments and redevelopments. Aimco has a single property loan maturing in 2023 with refunding requirements of less than $5 million. In December 2023, the initial term on Aimco's secured revolving credit facility expires and it is expected that Aimco will exercise its option to extend its maturity for one year.Public Market Equity &amp; DividendsAimco's primary goal is outsized risk-adjusted returns and accelerating growth for our shareholders. In addition to allocating capital to accretive real estate investments and maintaining a solid balance sheet, Aimco will continue to repurchase shares when prices are significantly below our internal estimated net asset value. As of December 31, 2022, Aimco had the authorization remaining to purchase approximately 12 million additional shares of its common stock.Aimco does not presently intend to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend but may occasionally distribute amounts, as necessary, to comply with REIT requirements.Commitment to Enhance Stockholder ValueAs announced in the fall of 2022, the Aimco Board of Directors is overseeing the review of a broad range of options to enhance stockholder value. This effort is being led by Pat Gibson, the Chairwoman of Aimco’s Investment Committee, who has considerable experience in the areas of real estate finance, transactions, and capital markets. There can be no assurance that the ongoing review will result in any transaction or other change or outcome. Aimco does not intend to comment further until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.Supplemental InformationThe full text of this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information referenced in this release are available on Aimco’s website at investors.aimco.com.Glossary &amp; Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresFinancial and operating measures found in this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are measures not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

The dollar is now almost 1% higher for the year to date. Emerging market equities are at their lowest since Jan 4, the VIX 'fear index' is at its highest since Jan 3 and the S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq have wiped out all of February gains.Whether or not stocks are in what Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson likens to the 'death zone' at the top of Everest, some soul searching is underway nonetheless. And markets have calmed a little early on Wednesday.Minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting are due for release on Wednesday - but data releases showing sticky inflation, booming retail sales and a service sector back in expansion emerged after that meeting. And so a speech from New York Fed chief John Williams make give a better steer on current thinking.Markets are now priced for a Fed 'terminal rate' in the 5.25-5.50% range by July and no cut from there by year-end.European central bankers are also talking tough as the region's economies dodge recession and inflation stays high. Deutsche Bank lifted its forecast for where the European Central Bank's key rate will peak in this tightening cycle to 3.75% from 3.25% previously - 125bp up from current rates.The only positive inflation news was that ebbing world oil prices are now tracking year-on-year declines of 15% as huge base effects from last February's Ukraine invasion kick in. Weak U.S. housing updates and downbeat retail readouts from Walmart and Home Depot also question the prevailing narrative.Story continuesBut geopolitical concerns rankle again ahead of Friday's anniversary, with Russia unilaterally withdrawing from a key nuclear arms control treaty.As G20 finance chiefs meet in India, the world is watching closely the extent of the alliance between Beijing and Moscow.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The major U.S. indices had their worst day of 2023 on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq (^IXIC), closing down more than 6% from its early-February high. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury rates jumped to five-month highs with Federal Reserve hawkishness in focus.U.S. equities — particular tech stocks — are quickly weakening against a backdrop of interest rates that are once again surging higher. We've seen this play out several times since stocks peaked over a year ago when interest rate volatility in the bond market gave way to stock market volatility (meaning stocks sell off).The difference in 2023 — as we've been writing — is that growth stocks (like the unloved tech stocks) had once again been leading the way after taking a back seat to cyclical and value stocks throughout 2022.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The chart above shows that many of the worst-performing stocks from 2022 are this year's winners. Last year's duds caught Wall Street flat-footed and short this year — mounting a vicious rip-your-face-off rally.Tesla (TSLA) is up 60% in 2023 after shedding three quarters of its value from its November 2021 high. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) are each holding onto gains of 40% or more this year.The result is that Investors who were massively underwater on tech names coming into the year were given a tantalizing reminder of the fast and furious gains made in the space in years prior.Will the rally continue?Things have moved so rapidly and into such unchartered territory over this business cycle that massive disagreements have emerged among investors looking at different things — each through their own lens.Story continuesTechnical traders can point to charts of global indices and large U.S. sectors breaking out to new highs (as they've been doing since late-2022).Macro investors may chalk off the 2023 rally as junk-led, YOLO-redux and point to a potential hard landing that's now simply been delayed.Central bank and shadow banking buffs who track liquidity can point to the virtual flood of yen and yuan being ""printed"" by the Japanese and Chinese central banks this year — so big that it potentially offsets the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening.Finally, economists — after months of debating a hard versus soft landing — can point to a metaphor-destroying, ""no landing"" non sequitur.Some of these theories are mutually compatible given the differing timeframes. But as the dust settles on Wednesday's rout, it's important to remember that low-quality stocks with bad balance sheets and cash flow are unlikely to lead meaningfully again — even if the major indices resume their rallies.Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro USA, pointed out in a note to clients that looking inside the Russell 3000 — a broad measure of small, mid, and large-cap U.S. stocks — 44 of the 50 best-performing stocks this year didn't generate any profits over the past 12 months.""That’s strange, considering that higher bond yields should entice investors to focus on profits and cash flows,"" she says, noting the cognitive dissonance.Cox urges investors to tread carefully but not to run for the hills.""When rates are high, it’s smart to focus on what’s making money now while keeping your guard up with hedges and a defensive lean,"" she says, adding, ""Long-term investors may have an argument to take on some risk here, but they need to focus on quality companies, even if those quality companies fall into growth categories.""What to Watch TodayEconomy7:00 a.m. ET: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Feb. 17 (-7.7% during prior week)2:00 p.m. ET: FOMC Meeting Minutes, Feb. 1EarningsAllbirds (BIRD), Altice USA (ATUS), Baidu (BIDU), Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI), Bumble (BMBL), Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), eBay (EBAY), Etsy (ETSY), Fidelity National (FNF), Lemonade (LMND), Lucid Group (LCID), Marriott Vacations (VAC), Overstock.com (OSTK), Rent-A-Center (RCII), Teladoc (TDOC), TJX (TJX), United Therapeutics (UTHR), Wingstop (WING), Wolverine World Wide (WWW)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

INGN is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its high prospects in the portable oxygen concentrator (POC) space. Solid performance in the third quarter of 2022 and a strong product portfolio also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and foreign exchange fluctuations are major downsides.Over the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 25.4% against the industry’s 2.8% growth. The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.1% in the said time frame.The renowned supplier of POCs has a market capitalization of $538.6 million. The company projects 8.5% growth in 2023 revenues and also expects to witness an earnings improvement. Inogen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 33.9%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.High Prospects in the POC Space: We are optimistic about POCs’ superiority over conventional oxygen therapy (known as the delivery model). POCs provide unlimited oxygen supply anywhere, thereby enhancing patient independence and mobility. Management at Inogen expects this to have an incremental positive impact on its industry and POCs’ adoption.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Inogen’s expanding product portfolio. The company provides oxygen concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. The company’s notable products include the Inogen One G5 in the domestic business-to-business and direct-to-consumer channels, besides the Inogen One G3 and One G4 POC. Inogen At Home is aptly formulated for patients who need oxygen therapy during sleep. Last month, the company achieved regulatory milestones in the United States and the European Union to support its portable oxygen concentrator products.Strong Q4 Preliminary Results: Inogen’s robust year-over-year uptick in fourth-quarter 2022 revenues buoys optimism. Management is upbeat about its ability to register revenues within its earlier expectations, despite the prevailing macroeconomic pressures and headwinds resulting from Inogen’s efforts to upgrade the operating disciplines in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) commercial team. The company expects to improve productivity in the near term on the back of its DTC team’s tenure extension and continued partnership with its business-to-business (B2B) channel to manage economic pressures.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) market is a highly competitive industry. Inogen competes with a number of POC manufacturers and distributors, as well as providers of other LTOT solutions like home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders, stationary concentrators, transfilling concentrators and liquid oxygen. Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, Inogen expects the industry to become increasingly competitive in the future.Forex Woes: Inogen generates a significant portion of its revenues from the international market. Management expects international revenues to remain bleak, owing to the timing and size of the distributor.  It also expects adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term, owing to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies.Inogen, Inc PriceInogen, Inc PriceInogen, Inc price | Inogen, Inc QuoteEstimate TrendInogen has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has widened from $1.81 to $1.91.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $88.6 million, indicating a 16% improvement from the year-ago reported number.

However, adjusted earnings declined 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted EPS came in at $1.38 in the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and the new European Union medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP EPS was 92 cents, down 16.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.73 billion, up 4.1% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency and contribution from the company's fiscal first-quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT) and flat year over year on a reported basis. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.Third-quarter organic revenues, according to the company, reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience business, in international Diabetes markets and improved product availability across certain businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from ventilator sales, given the strong year-ago comparable due to COVID-19 severity, and sales in China, given volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes.Q3 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) were up 3% on a reported basis (up 2% on an organic basis) to $4.06 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.29 billion (30% of total revenues), down 6% on a reported basis (up 6% on an organic basis).Emerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.37 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 5% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 6.5% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 7.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from Structural Heart &amp; Aortic were up 8.8% at CER to $760 million. Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular revenues were up 1.5% at CER to $581 million.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.14 billion, down 1.6% year over year at CER. The company reported low-single-digit declines in both Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal. Excluding the unfavorable impact of ventilator sales, and sales in China, given the unfavorable impact of provincial VBP tenders, Medical Surgical revenues increased 3% organic.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.25 billion were up 8.5% year over year at CER, driven by a low-double-digit increase in Specialty Therapies and mid-single-digit increases in Neuromodulation and Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies, all organically.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $570 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenues declined in the mid-teens in Q3, offset by high-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-twenties growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by the high-teens growth of insulin pumps, mid-thirties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products on strong sales of the MiniMed 780G system and the associated increase in CGM attachment rates on the strength of the Guardian 4 sensor.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 312 basis points (bps) to 65.2% on a 5% fall in gross profit to $5.04 billion.Research and development expenses were up 2.9% year over year at $688 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 428 bps year over year to 22.5%.GuidanceMedtronic issued fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter guidance and updated its fiscal 2023 guidance.Fourth-quarter organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-5%. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of February, fourth-quarter revenues would be unfavorably affected by approximately $165 million to $215 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal Q4 worldwide revenues is pegged at $7.97 billion.The full-year adjusted EPS projection has been updated to the range of $5.28 to $5.30 (reflecting an increase in the lower end of the earlier-projected band of $5.25 to $5.30), including an estimated 21 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.26.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal third quarter. Barring the Medical Surgical group, the company reported year-over-year sales growth in each of its reporting segments organically. The company’s updated sales outlook for fiscal 2023 assumes considerable organic growth from the year-ago period’s levels, instilling optimism.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. The contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank and Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

290,944bff2d-fa1b-343f-80e7-ab8ea3ba6f4b,MCK,2023-02-22,Reasons to Retain Patterson Companies (PDCO) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-retain-patterson-companies-pdco-125912090.html,1676984352,STORY,"['PDCO', 'MCK', 'CAH']","[Patterson Companies, Inc.’s PDCO broad product line is driving its prospects. The company recorded currency-adjusted revenue growth in second-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. While the trend is expected to continue, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces are concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 1.3% against the industry’s 2.5% growth. The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.2% in the same time period.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.8 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to grow for the next five years at an annual rate of 7.8%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 7.88%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. One of the company’s most notable offerings is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broad private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are likely to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Sales in this segment were up 1.1% year over year during second-quarter fiscal 2023. The company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Solid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The company’s Companion Animal and Production Animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. The company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 0.7%, owing to sustained strength in the Production Animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review, on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition from other national and full-service firms, hundreds of small local distributors, and at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level. PDCO needs to introduce products for withstanding competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has increased from $2.27 to $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.62 billion, indicating a 1.4% improvement from the year-ago period. The earnings estimate of 60 cents per share in the fiscal third-quarter implies a 9.1% improvement from the year-ago period.Patterson Companies, Inc. PricePatterson Companies, Inc.

The information helped Fox secure the U.S. English-language rights with a $425 million bid. Telemundo, a division of Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, won U.S. Spanish-language rights for about $600 million.“I was disappointed,” Skipper said. “In fact, I was angry.”Skipper said he had assumed the highest bidder would prevail, but the process turned increasingly complicated when ESPN's offer was turned down and soccer officials opened a second round of bidding.Under questioning from a defense attorney, Skipper acknowledged that he did not know if anything illegal was going on behind the scenes.The trial is the latest development in a tangled corruption scandal that dates back nearly a decade and has ensnared more than three dozen media and soccer executives as well as associates.Story continuesSkipper's testimony was meant to corroborate statements by the government's star witness, Alejandro Burzaco, who testified over 11 days that he and the former Fox executives conspired to bribe South American soccer officials for TV rights to the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest annual tournament, the Copa Libertadores, and help land broadcasting rights to the World Cup, the sport’s most lucrative competition.Lawyers for Lopez and Martinez have asserted that the former executives are being framed, with one defense lawyer accusing Burzaco of masterminding the bribes.Burzaco is a former business partner of Lopez and Martinez, and headed an Argentinian marketing firm. He has cooperated in previous soccer corruption investigations since being arrested in 2015 in a bribery case. Critics contend he's cooperating to avoid prison.Burzaco has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. He testified in 2017 that all three South Americans on the FIFA executive council took million-dollar bribes to support Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup.Skipper said ESPN initially bid $250 million in 2011 for U.S. English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The company upped that to $400 million in a second round. Coupled with Univision's proposed contribution, the total came to $900 million.“We wanted to blow the bid away,” he said.ESPN held U.S. broadcasting rights for the World Cup from 1994 until 2014, first airing soccer's premier sporting event before it caught on with U.S. audiences. FIFA previously had to buy air time to get the tournament broadcast in the country.As the sport's audience grew, so did the World Cup's financial cachet.ESPN paid $100 million for the rights to broadcast the sporting event in 2010 and 2014.The dramatic hike spoke to the sporting event's increasing importance, Skipper said.December's World Cup final in Qatar, where Argentina prevailed over France in a dramatic title-clinching shootout, was the most-watched soccer match in the United States, according to television audience estimates.As a courtesy for helping FIFA develop a rise in soccer viewership, Skipper had hoped soccer officials would allow ESPN to match or beat competitors' proposals but was not approached to do so.So far, more than two dozen people have pleaded guilty and two people have been convicted at trial in connection with a U.S.-led investigation into tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks at soccer’s highest levels. Four corporate entities have also pleaded guilty. Four other companies were charged but reached agreements with the government to avoid prosecution.Soccer governing body, FIFA, has said it was not involved in any fraud or conspiracies and was a mere bystander as the scandal unfolded.Nevertheless, the scandal thrust the organization under worldwide scrutiny. It has since sought to polish its tarnished image.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Soros' investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns. Hungarian-born American investor George Soros is one of the world’s most celebrated hedge fund managers. He recently made the headlines for passing controversial remarks about Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the Munich Security Conference. However, the backlash he received from the audience did not hold any effect on his investments in India. In the fourth quarter of 2022, his hedge fund increased its position in an Indian startup, Freshworks, to over $33.3 million.Soros is mainly famous for making $1.1 billion in profits by betting on the British pound’s fall in 1992. Because of this stunt, he widely came to be known as ‘the man who broke the Bank of England’. As of February 2023, the billionaire’s real-time net worth came in at $6.7 billion.Soros Fund Management follows a global macro strategy, making bets on currency rates and other economic fluctuations. Soros studies the financial markets carefully as well as gauges the behaviors of market participants. Soros believes that the behavior of market participants is crucial in understanding the irregular and fluctuating nature of the market. Following these investment philosophies, his hedge fund managed to report positive returns over the years. The fund averaged an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. In 2020, his fund gained 23.2%, versus an average hedge fund return of 11.6% during the same year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.As of the close of Q4 2022, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio has a value of over $7.26 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in the previous quarter. Some of the hedge fund’s major holdings in Q4 included Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). However, in this article, we will focus on dividend stocks that billionaire George Soros owns.Story continues10 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros OwnsGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks in Soros Fund Management's portfolio, as of Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in the fund.Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $784,280  Dividend Yield as of February 21: 2.77% The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment bank that provides financial services to its consumers. Soros Fund Management started investing in the company during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $807,000. In Q4 2022, the hedge fund did not change its position in the company and owned stakes worth $784,280. The company made up 0.01% of the billionaire George Soros's portfolio. Other prominent holdings of the hedge fund include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).On January 17, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) declared a quarterly dividend of $2.50 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.77%, as of February 21.In February, Wells Fargo raised its price target on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) to $420 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the company's price-to-book ratio relative to its peers.At the end of Q4 2022, 74 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion. Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness were some of the company's most prominent stakeholders in Q4.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Disney previously had those rights, and used them to drive subscribers to its streaming service, Disney+ Hotstar.Viacom18 is taking a different approach, offering the games to as many people as possible in order to generate advertising sales, said the people, who declined to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced publicly. Free media services such as Google and Facebook generate billions of dollars in advertising sales in the country, and have had far more success than paid premium products like Netflix.Viacom18 executives have estimated that an audience in excess of 550 million will watch the weeks-long IPL games, which will boost the conglomerate’s technology and internet ambitions, ranging from online retail to entertainment.This year’s series of matches, each lasting a relatively short three hours in length, will kick off on March 31 and go on for nearly eight weeks. Viacom18 will allow users to watch any number of games for any length time on any internet-connected device.It’s a familiar playbook for Reliance, which offered mobile service at prices far below the competition, signing up hundreds of millions of customers and putting rivals out of business. Ambani’s conglomerate owns Reliance Jio, the country’s largest telecom operator by market share, closing in on a half-billion subscribers. The five-year IPL contract gives it a reach like no other to capitalize on a tournament described as the Super Bowl of cricket.Story continuesThe cost of cricket rights soared last year as several media companies sought them to boost their nascent streaming businesses. Internet adoption is scaling at rocket speed in India, and global and domestic media giants see the country as a catalyst to boost their subscriber bases. Disney, which previously owned the IPL streaming rights, lost that auction but bagged TV broadcast rights after out-gunning Sony. Amazon, another contender, pulled out of the bids at the last hour after completing the initial auction paperwork.Ambani won by paying nearly three times what Disney had paid in the previous deal. Disney in turn paid even more — about $3 billion — for the traditional TV package. Ambani bid for the IPL rights in conjunction with Paramount, billionaire James Murdoch and Uday Shankar, the former head of Hotstar.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGerm-Zapping Lasers Help Cut Down on Infections After SurgeryAfter Multibillion-Dollar Fintech Binge, Wall Street Has a Writedown HangoverHow Ben &amp; Jerry's Ended Up at War With ItselfWith Human Metalworkers Hard to Come By, Robotic Blacksmiths Step UpSpy Balloons Are the Slow and Silent Future of Surveillance©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Helmerich &amp; Payne's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Helmerich &amp; Payne is:5.6% = US$154m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Helmerich &amp; Payne's Earnings Growth And 5.6% ROEAt first glance, Helmerich &amp; Payne's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 9.8%. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 43% seen by Helmerich &amp; Payne over the last five years is not surprising. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesNext, when we compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 4.0% in the same period, we still found Helmerich &amp; Payne's performance to be quite bleak, because the company has been shrinking its earnings faster than the industry.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is HP worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether HP is currently mispriced by the market.Is Helmerich &amp; Payne Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Helmerich &amp; Payne's declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 69% (or a retention ratio of 31%). With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Helmerich &amp; Payne.Additionally, Helmerich &amp; Payne has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 17% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 17%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, Helmerich &amp; Payne's performance is quite a big let-down. As a result of its low ROE and lack of much reinvestment into the business, the company has seen a disappointing earnings growth rate. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

313,566b10b9-5a9c-3c71-bbf1-32b602beb3d6,HP,2023-02-22,Is It Worth Investing in Helmerich & Payne (HP) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-helmerich-payne-hp-143002895.html,1676989802,STORY,['HP'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP).Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Helmerich &amp; Payne here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Helmerich &amp; Payne, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness.

This compares to earnings of $0.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.22%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this investment company would post earnings of $0.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of -2.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.MidCap Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $63.32 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $54.97 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.MidCap Financial shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for MidCap Financial?While MidCap Financial has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MidCap Financial: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 2% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 2.06%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.32%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had lost 1.9% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.51% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.88% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Oracle to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.31%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.90 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion, which would represent changes of 0% and +17.19%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.03% lower. Oracle is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Oracle has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.8 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 27.9, which means Oracle is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that ORCL has a PEG ratio of 2.23. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. ORCL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.08 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 106, which puts it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $924.32 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Public Storage shares have added about 6.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.2%.What's Next for Public Storage?While Public Storage has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Public Storage: mixed.

We enter 2023 in a position of strength, with our digital and operating model transformation enhancing the industry’s highest direct operating margins, strong-growth properties in our non-same store pool comprising more than 25% of the portfolio, and a balance sheet positioned to fund broad opportunity across acquisitions, development, and redevelopment. Our ability to drive unmatched levels of performance and profitability uniquely positions us for growth and value creation into the future.""Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $2.06 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (""Core FFO"") of $4.16 per diluted share, an increase of 17.5% relative to the same period in 2021. We sold our entire equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. (""PSB"") in July 2022 and since then no longer recognize any further equity in earnings of PSB. Core FFO per diluted share increased 22.4% excluding the contribution from our equity investment in PSB to Core FFO per diluted share.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 15.0%, resulting from a 13.0% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 81.2% Same Store direct net operating income margin, an increase of 1.8% relative to the same period in 2021.Acquired 30 self-storage facilities with 1.6 million net rentable square feet for $228.6 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities with 0.5 million net rentable square feet, for $70.5 million.Opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $101.2 million. At December 31, 2022, we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.6 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $979.6 million.Story continuesHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2022Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $23.50 per diluted share.Reported Core FFO of $15.92 per diluted share, an increase of 23.1% from 2021. Core FFO per diluted share increased 26.1% excluding the contribution from our equity investment in PSB to Core FFO per diluted share.Increased Same Store direct net operating income by 17.1%, resulting from a 14.8% increase in Same Store revenues.Acquired 74 self-storage facilities with 4.7 million net rentable square feet for $730.5 million.Opened eight newly developed facilities and various expansion projects with 1.4 million net rentable square feet costing $227.2 million.Distributed a one-time dividend of $13.15 per common share, totaling $2.3 billion, in August 2022 in connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB, upon completion of its merger transaction with affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate on July 20, 2022.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $362.6 million or $2.06 per diluted common share, compared to $558.1 million or $3.17 per diluted common share in the same period in 2021, representing a decrease of $195.5 million or $1.11 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $177.2 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $143.9 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB, partially offset by (iii) a $137.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income.The $137.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of an $87.2 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $50.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 13.0% or $94.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 4.1% or $7.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, marketing expense, and other direct property costs, partially offset by a decrease in on-site property manager payroll expense. The increase in net operating income of $50.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2022For 2022, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $4,142.3 million or $23.50 per diluted common share, compared to $1,732.4 million or $9.87 per diluted common share in 2021, representing an increase of $2,409.9 million or $13.63 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $2.1 billion gain on sale of our equity investment in PSB and (ii) a $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income, partially offset by (iii) a $174.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) a $125.1 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to sale of our equity investment in PSB, and (v) a $45.5 million increase in interest expense.The $614.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income in 2022 as compared to 2021 is a result of a $370.1 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $244.2 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 14.8% or $409.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.7% or $39.9 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs, and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $244.2 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (""FFO"") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended December 31, 2022, FFO was $3.38 per diluted common share as compared to $3.67 in the same period in 2021, representing a decrease of 7.9%.For the year ended December 31, 2022, FFO was $16.46 per diluted common share, as compared to $13.36 in the same period in 2021, representing an increase of 23.2%.We also present ""Core FFO"" and ""Core FFO per share,"" non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of loss contingency accruals and casualties, unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs, severance of a senior executive, lease termination income, and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20222021PercentageChange20222021PercentageChange(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO:Net income allocable to common shareholders$362,622$558,058(35.0)%$4,142,288$1,732,444139.1%Eliminate items excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization224,438204,131881,569709,349Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments9,83719,24454,82273,729Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders(1,781)(1,002)(6,622)(4,415)Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments—(134,116)(54,403)(165,272)Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.——(2,116,839)—FFO allocable to common shares$595,116$646,315(7.9)%$2,900,815$2,345,83523.7%Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss138,956(38,203)(98,314)(111,787)Preferred share redemption charge—14,615—31,604Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties (a)(1,301)—4,8174,909Other items(760)—(338)(543)Core FFO allocable to common shares$732,011$622,72717.5%$2,806,980$2,270,01823.7%Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share:Diluted earnings per share$2.06$3.17(35.0)%$23.50$9.87138.1%Eliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization1.321.265.274.44Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments—(0.76)(0.31)(0.95)Gain on sale of equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc.——(12.00)—FFO per share$3.38$3.67(7.9)%$16.46$13.3623.2%Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss0.79(0.22)(0.57)(0.64)Preferred share redemption charge—0.09—0.18Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties (a)(0.01)—0.030.03Other items————Core FFO per share$4.16$3.5417.5%$15.92$12.9323.1%Exclude the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. to Core FFO per share—(0.14)(0.33)(0.57)Core FFO per share, excluding the impact of PS Business Parks, Inc.$4.16$3.4022.4%$15.59$12.3626.1%Diluted weighted average common shares176,144176,079176,280175,568(a)Property losses and tenant claims due to casualties were related to Hurricane Ian for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, and Hurricane Ida for the same periods in 2021. The related charges were included in general and administrative expenses and ancillary cost of operations on the Selected Consolidated Income Statement Data.Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,276 facilities (149.1 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 73% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20222021PercentageChange20222021PercentageChange(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data)Revenues (a):Rental income$792,227$702,97312.7%$3,074,192$2,683,11614.6%Late charges and administrative fees26,69521,52924.0%101,01582,14723.0%Total revenues818,922724,50213.0%3,175,2072,765,26314.8%Direct cost of operations (a):Property taxes65,69763,9292.8%279,388267,9614.3%On-site property manager payroll29,60032,053(7.7)%119,139114,4264.1%Repairs and maintenance15,22313,53912.4%58,46852,70310.9%Utilities9,9439,3356.5%43,45740,5487.2%Marketing13,6159,13049.1%45,90639,68215.7%Other direct property costs19,90418,1919.4%80,99173,64610.0%Total direct cost of operations153,982146,1775.3%627,349588,9666.5%Direct net operating income (b)664,940578,32515.0%2,547,8582,176,29717.1%Indirect cost of operations (a):Supervisory payroll(8,464)(9,230)(8.3)%(35,017)(37,058)(5.5)%Centralized management costs(15,665)(15,322)2.2%(61,922)(55,350)11.9%Share-based compensation(3,297)(3,464)(4.8)%(14,203)(17,255)(17.7)%Net operating income (c)$637,514$550,30915.8%$2,436,716$2,066,63417.9%Gross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense)81.2%79.8%1.8%80.2%78.7%1.9%Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense)77.8%76.0%2.4%76.7%74.7%2.7%Weighted average for the period:Square foot occupancy93.4%95.9%(2.6)%94.9%96.3%(1.5)%Realized annual rental income per (d):Occupied square foot$22.74$19.6615.7%$21.73$18.6716.4%Available square foot$21.25$18.8512.7%$20.61$17.9914.6%At December 31:Square foot occupancy92.4%94.8%(2.5)%Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e)$23.02$19.9615.3%(a)Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities.(b)Direct net operating income (""Direct NOI""), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense.

Realized annual rent per available square foot (""REVPAF"") is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.(e)Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2,276 Same Store Facilities, we have 593 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies, revenues, or cost of operations since January 1, 2020 or that we did not own as of January 1, 2020, including 368 facilities that were acquired, 62 newly developed facilities, 91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion, and 72 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively, the ""Non-Same Store Facilities""). Operating data, metrics, and further commentary with respect to these facilities, including detail by vintage, are included in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" under ""Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations"" in our December 31, 2022 Form 10-K.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, we closed the acquisition of 30 self-storage facilities (26 in Florida, and one each in Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, and Utah) with 1.6 million net rentable square feet for $228.6 million. These include the Neighborhood Storage portfolio in the Ocala, Florida market, consisting of 28 properties with 1.2 million net rentable square feet, with 26 properties closed in December 2022 for $179.8 million and two properties that are under construction and expected to close in early 2023.During 2022, we closed the acquisition of 74 self-storage facilities (28 in Florida, ten in Oklahoma, seven in Texas, four in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, two each in Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, and Ohio, and one each in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Utah) with 4.7 million net rentable square feet for $730.5 million.Additionally, on July 8, 2022, we acquired from PSB the commercial interests in five properties at three sites jointly occupied with our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia, for $47.3 million.Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities across five states with 0.5 million net rentable square feet, for $70.5 million.During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $100.8 million, NOI of $79.9 million (including Direct NOI of $82.7 million), and average square footage occupancy of 89.6% for 2022.During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $79.2 million, NOI of $48.4 million (including Direct NOI of $51.2 million), and average square footage occupancy of 79.4% for 2022.During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.5 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in Florida, and 0.1 million each in New Jersey, Maryland, and Michigan) costing $101.2 million. During 2022, we opened eight newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (1.4 million net rentable square feet – 0.4 million in Florida, 0.2 million each in Michigan and Minnesota, 0.1 million each in Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, and Texas, and 0.1 million in various other states combined) costing $227.2 million. At December 31, 2022, we had various facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $492.3 million and various expansion projects (2.5 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $487.3 million. Our aggregate 4.6 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.7 million in California, 0.6 million in Texas, 0.4 million in Maryland, 0.3 million each in Florida and Hawaii, 0.2 million each in New Jersey and Washington, and 0.9 million in other states. The remaining $606.6 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On July 20, 2022, we sold our entire equity investment in PSB upon the closing of the merger of PSB with affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate. We received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $2.1 billion. In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB, on August 4, 2022, we paid a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share, totaling approximately $2.3 billion.As previously announced, our Board of Trustees declared a 50% increase in the Company’s regular common quarterly dividend from $2.00 to $3.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on March 30, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2023.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31, 2023Set forth below are our current expectations with respect to full year 2023 Core FFO per share and certain underlying assumptions, excluding the impact of the proposed acquisition of Life Storage. In reliance on the exception provided by applicable SEC rules, we do not provide guidance for GAAP net income per share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, or a reconciliation of 2023 Core FFO per share to GAAP net income per share because we are unable to reasonably predict the following items which are included in GAAP net income: (i) gains or losses on sales of real estate investments, (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. The actual amounts for any and all of these items could significantly impact our 2023 GAAP net income and, as disclosed in our historical financial results, have significantly impacted GAAP net income in prior periods. Our expectations on self-storage operations reflect the following updated 2023 Same Store and Non-Same Store pools for properties we owned at December 31, 2022: (i) 2,348 Same Store Facilities (155.5 million net rentable square feet) that we have owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2021, which generated NOI of $2,517.3 million in 2022 and (ii) 521 Non-Same Store Facilities (48.7 million net rentable square feet) that were not stabilized with respect to occupancy, revenues, or cost of operations since January 1, 2021 or that we did not own as of January 1, 2021, which generated NOI of $448.5 million in 2022.Guidance Ranges for 2023LowHigh($ amounts in thousands, except per share data)Same Store:Revenue growth2.50%5.00%Expense growth4.75%6.75%Net operating income growth1.20%5.10%Acquisitions$750,000Development openings$375,000Non-Same Store net operating income$510,000$530,000Ancillary net operating income$169,000$174,000General and administrative expense$100,000$106,000Interest expense$177,000Preferred dividends$195,000Capital expenditures$450,000Core FFO per share$16.10$16.80Core FFO per share growth from 2022 Core FFO per share1.1%5.5%Core FFO per share growth from 2022 Core FFO per share, excluding the impact of PS Business Parks, Inc.3.3%7.8%Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2024 and beyond)$80,000Leadership AnnouncementsWe are today announcing the following leadership developments:Appointment of Executive OfficerDavid Lee, our Chief Operating Officer, has been appointed as an executive officer of Public Storage to serve as our principal operating officer, effective immediately.

(MU) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-attracting-140002276.html,1676988002,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of -129.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of -$2.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -125%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.08 indicates a change of +151.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -51.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.4 billion and $22.95 billion estimates indicate -46.7% and +39.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE:MTD) stock is up an impressive 137% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 6.6%.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Mettler-Toledo International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 19% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Mettler-Toledo International has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Mettler-Toledo International has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.7% in the last twelve months. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 19% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mettler-Toledo International better, we need to consider many other factors.

350,7d1c5959-4cff-30c6-b12d-b94dcd17f6b4,TRIP,2023-02-22,Online Travel Storytelling Spin Cycle Is Running at Full Speed,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/online-travel-storytelling-spin-cycle-073000401.html,1677051000,STORY,"['ABNB', 'EXPE', 'TRIP']","[Online Travel This WeekIt’s another earnings season so online travel companies such as Airbnb, Expedia and Tripadvisor occasionally present facts in a misleading — or at least in an exceedingly positive-sounding — way.Airbnb ProductivityAirbnb officials mentioned twice in their discussion last week with financial analysts about 2022 earnings that their roster of 6,800 employees at the end of 2022 was 5 percent lower than during pre-pandemic 2019 yet Airbnb’s revenue has increased 75 percent to $8.4 billion.That means significantly more revenue per employee these days.What Airbnb execs didn’t mention, however, is that Airbnb at the end of 2022 “relied on a global network of approximately 11,000 third-party contingent workers to handle the vast majority of our community support contacts,” as noted in its annual financial filing.As with the size of its full-time workforce, which Airbnb reduced by 25 percent in May 2020, the company likewise terminated many contract workers, and a bunch of them handled customer service, at that time. Airbnb hasn’t disclosed how many third-party contract workers it added in the interim, and how this may have impacted the productivity numbers the company boasts about.Expedia U.S. Is a ThingExpedia has often spoken about how it performed in the U.S., its biggest market, but it seldom talks about “Expedia U.S.,” as it did seven times in its fourth quarter earnings call earlier this month, as if Expedia U.S. were a new division or a separate brand.Expedia Group sought to showcase the performance of the Expedia brand in the U.S. because it intentionally gave short shrift in marketing to some other geographies around the world and de-emphasized certain noncore brands, too.Expedia U.S. saw its loyalty numbers jump 300 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2019, and it has nearly 60 percent more engaged app users, the company said.Story continuesNo word on how the loyalty program and engaged app user numbers might have jumped or declined on a global basis, though.Overall, some of that upside in the U.S. got deflated with under-performance abroad so Expedia was putting a pretty shine on the statistics it brought to the fore.“Of course, when you look at our all-up B2C (business to consumer) numbers, the accelerating performance of Expedia U.S. has been largely offset by our intentional de-emphasis of some smaller noncore brands or pull back in certain geographies where we did not have the right model, and of course, our much-discussed technical migration, which required significant work and like all migrations resulted in some short-term friction,” Expedia Group Peter Kern said.But Expedia faces challenges even in its U.S. home turf. A Skift Research survey of U.S. travelers found that Expedia’s U.S. “websites saw a 10 point share decline, falling from 59 percent of OTA [online travel agency] bookings in 2020 to 49 percent in 2022.”Booking.com is seemingly behind some of Expedia’s weakness.“Right off the bat, the most shocking result is that, in our survey data, Booking.com surpassed Expedia.com as the most used booking site in the U.S. in 2022,” the Skift Research report found. “Expedia.com had been number one in 2020 and 2021 with Booking.com in second place.”That would be a disturbing result for Expedia in its homeland.Tripadvisor Metasearch in the U.S. Bounced BackHotel metasearch is an important part of Tripadvisor’s core business, and the company disclosed last week that the feature’s revenue only clawed back in 2022 to 85 percent of 2019 levels.The company also stated that its U.S. metasearch revenue — as distinct from its global metasearch revenue — achieved “parity” in 2022 with 2019 numbers, and was accelerating as it headed into 2023.What parity means wasn’t specifically defined but, hey, fair enough.In BriefSection 230 ChallengesThe U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case that could potentially upend online travel in unforeseen ways. The case revolves around a challenge to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which for years has given online platforms in the U.S. broad liability protections for review and video content they host that is created by third parties. A ruling striking down parts of Section 230 could alter the business models of numerous travel and tech companies. CNBCTrivago and Tripadvisor Metasearch Fell BehindIs metasearch dead? Hardly, just ask Google. But two of the sector’s weaker public company players, Trivago and Tripadvisor, saw their metasearch numbers at lethargic levels compared with other sectors in 2022. SkiftTripadvisor Generative AI IssuesCan you think of a more easy application for generative AI to attach itself to than creating an in-destination tour? Tripadvisor’s turnaround strategy involves creating new trip-planning tools that are distinct from the competition.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Paccar (PCAR), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PCAR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this truck maker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For PCAR, shares are up 3.7% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry is up 3.63% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.04% compares favorably with the industry's 6.15% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Paccar have increased 9.58% over the past quarter, and have gained 21.03% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.29% and -4.71%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to PCAR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PCAR is currently averaging 3,476,009 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PCAR.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PCAR's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.67 to $6.11 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PCAR is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Paccar on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company includes this measure because management believes it permits investors to view the company's performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the company's ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be a difference between this measure and its GAAP equivalent due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, the impact of asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results. The company is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis. In addition, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation of its non-GAAP net operating earnings guidance to its GAAP equivalent without unreasonable efforts.Schedule 1 - Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income Available to Common Shareholders to Net Operating Earnings Available to Common Shareholders (Non-GAAP) (unaudited)Three Months EndedDecember 31,Twelve Months EndedDecember 31,(in millions, except per share amounts)2022202120222021GAAP Net Income Available to Common Shareholders$       230.8$       152.2$       749.0$       529.8Adjustments to Operating Income:Operating Revenues:Weather - compared to normal(3.2)13.7(24.9)1.2 FAC adjustment(1)——8.0—Operating Expenses:Greater Lawrence Incident—1.2—9.2Plant retirement costs—1.9—14.1NiSource Next initiative(2)—2.63.324.7Massachusetts Business related amounts(3)——(105.0)6.8Total adjustments to operating income(3.2)19.4(118.6)56.0Other Income (Deductions):Interest rate swap settlement gain(10.0)—(10.0)—Income Taxes:Tax effect of above items(4)3.4(4.9)27.8(14.6)Total adjustments to net income(9.8)14.5(100.8)41.4Net Operating Earnings Available to Common Shareholders (Non-GAAP)$       221.0$       166.7$       648.2$       571.2Diluted Average Common Shares445.9428.8442.7417.3GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share$         0.52$         0.36$         1.70$         1.27Adjustments to diluted earnings per share (0.02)0.03(0.23)0.10Non-GAAP Diluted Net Operating Earnings Per Share(5)$         0.50$         0.39$         1.47$         1.37(1)Represents fuel costs deemed over-collected from customers through the FAC mechanism and ordered to be refunded to customers.(2)Represents incremental severance and third-party consulting costs incurred in connection with the NiSource Next initiative.(3)2022 represents proceeds from a property insurance settlement related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. 2021 primarily represents final net working capital adjustments to the purchase price for the loss incurred on the sale of the Massachusetts Business.(4)Represents income tax expense calculated using the statutory tax rates by legal entity.(5)The Non-GAAP diluted NOEPS numerator is equal to net operating earnings available to common shareholders adjusted for add-backs for interest expense incurred, net of tax, related to Series A Equity Unit purchase contracts.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, NiSource has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that NI has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.NI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.55, while NEE has a forward P/E of 24.42. We also note that NI has a PEG ratio of 2.57. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.70.Another notable valuation metric for NI is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NEE has a P/B of 3.13.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NI's Value grade of B and NEE's Value grade of D.NI stands above NEE thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that NI is the superior value option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.88%.Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter of 2022, EIX’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures and extremely dry weather conditions, leading to severe drought conditions. Such a weather pattern is likely to have boosted the demand for electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the revenues of the company in the fourth quarter of 2022.Additionally, the positive impact of the general rate case may have boosted the revenues of the company in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, the immense drought-like condition may have caused wildfire events, which are likely to have disrupted the smooth flow of electricity to its customers. This may have partially dampened the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.63 billion. This suggests an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter.Considering the current interest rate environment, the company is likely to have incurred higher interest expenses in the fourth quarter, which might have hurt its bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08 per share. This indicates a decline of 6.9% from the prior-year reported figure.Edison International Price and EPS SurpriseEdison International Price and EPS SurpriseEdison International price-eps-surprise | Edison International QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for EIX this time.

365,351de7b6-a22d-36af-9498-c13ea81e6c2b,PNR,2023-02-22,7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Clean Water Technology,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-future-clean-014543206.html,1676771143,STORY,"['XYL', 'DHR', 'AWK', 'PNR', 'CWCO', 'WTRG']","[When many investors think about clean water stocks, the first thing that comes to mind for many investors is utility stocks. And hey, in today’s volatile market, the relative safety and security that comes from owning utilities is not a bad idea.  But if you’re an investor looking for growth, you’ll be looking for more options. Right now, there are several interesting water stocks to consider. That’s because as you probably learned in school, only about 1% of the total water supply is drinkable. And some analysts predict that by 2025 as much as two-thirds of the world will face a shortage of freshwater.  Many of us don’t think much about water. But several geographies of the world, including areas right here in the United States, are dealing with multi-year droughts. In parts of Arizona, California, and Nevada, water levels are at historic lows. Accordingly, the federal government is threatening to cut water use by 25%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I’ll highlight seven clean water stocks that are using clean water technology to address this ongoing crisis. AWKAmerican Water Works$149.61WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15DHRDanaher$256.29PNRPentair$56.83CWCOConsolidated Water$15.30PRMWPrimo Water Corporation$16.33XYLXylem$107.29American Water Works (AWK) A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of clean water stocks is one of the largest water utilities in the country. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated monopoly. That means it doesn’t have competition in the areas it serves. However, in return, its prices are regulated. The company does business in 14 states and serves a total of more than 3 million customers. That’s a good predictor of future revenue and earnings, because its customers have to pay their utility bills.  And American Water Works isn’t standing still. The company plans to spend between $22 billion and $25 billion making strategic capital investments to continue to grow its business through acquisitions.  Story continuesInvestors certainly pay a premium to own AWK stock. Although the company’s current price-earnings ratio of around 20-times may seem attractive to some, it’s expensive relative to the broader market. That said, this higher multiple is somewhat offset by an attractive dividend which American Water Works has been increasing for the last 13 years, which is also supported by a sustainable payout ratio of around 36%.  Essential Utilities (WTRG) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is not a pure-play water stock. However, the company still supplies water and wastewater services to over 3 million customers across 14 states.  Essential Utilities is a diversified operation, and is also the parent company of Peoples Natural Gas. This has added volatility to the stock in recent years, with significant price volatility in 2021 turning into tailwinds in 2022 as the price of natural gas spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With natural gas prices expected to stay elevated for the next few years, this will be a bonus to shareholders considering WTRG stock for its diversified commodities exposure. Additionally, the company continues to showcase a strong balance sheet. Essential Utilities is trading at around 25-times earnings,which is a value compared to the sector average which is about 35-times earnings. Essential Utilities is also a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 31 years. Finally, the company’s current 2.5% dividend yield is supported by projected earnings growth of about 7% over the next five years. Danaher (DHR) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comDanaher (NYSE:DHR) makes this list of clean water stocks because one of the company’s revenue drivers comes from providing water testing equipment. And if Danaher is correct in citing that nearly 33% of the global population lacks access to clean drinking water, then its potential growth prospects may be even greater than current investors envision.  This water exposure also provides an even larger addressable market for the company. Currently, water testing equipment accounts for nearly 10% of the company’s revenue today. However, this percentage continues to climb both quarterly and year-over-year. For the next five years, the company’s revenue and earnings are both expected to climb somewhere in the high single digits. But if water testing becomes the revenue driver that the company expects, Danaher’s revenue may approach its historical 12% annual revenue growth level. DHR stock is down approximately 4.4% over the last 12 months which puts it in line with the S&amp;P 500. Danaher has a moderate buy rating and a price target of just over $300. That represents a gain of approximately 20% from the current stock price.  Pentair (PNR) In this photo illustration the Pentair (PNR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is next on this list of clean water stocks. The company provides exposure to many of the same business lines as other companies on this list, such as water treatment, energy-efficient water treatment, water systems, and pumps. However, the reason it makes this list is due to the way the company can help address the current issues with our global water supply. The company features a countertop water filtration system, the Pentair Countertop Drinking System, that can help reduce the need for plastic water bottles. In addition to providing filtered water from the tap, it’s expected this product will contribute to the growth of the growing circular economy.  PNR stock is up about 24% in 2023, and if the company continues its recent pattern of delivering higher year-over-year revenue and earnings, there may be more upside than the 6.5% consensus price target of analysts. Plus, Pentair is another dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 48 years.   Consolidated Water (CWCO) Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comI need to give credit to my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto who recently wrote about Consolidated Water (NYSE:CWCO). Much of what the company does is not distinguishable from other water utilities. However, the company is heavily involved in the process of desalination.  If 97% of the world’s water is salt water, then it stands to reason that companies involved in desalination will have a distinct advantage. And Consolidated already appears to have a first move advantage with the work its doing, and/or financing, in the Caribbean.  CWCO stock is a small-cap option in this space, which means it could be more volatile. That said, this stock has been around since 1995. Accordingly, investors have a decent track record to follow. In addition to being up 17% over the last year, analysts suggest the stock may have 30% more upside. And with projections of average earnings per share gains of 177% for the next five years, that may be a low estimate.  Primo Water Corporation (PRMW) Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to pure-play water stocks, it doesn’t get much purer than Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW). One of the company’s signature products is its exchangeable water tanks that are available at many big-box states.  PRMW stock is up just 9% over the last five years. But that’s to be expected, because the company has been going through a transformation. It sold off its coffee and tea business in 2020. And in 2021, Primo announced it was exiting the single-use bottled water business at retail locations in the United States. That will not only endear the company to the ESG crowd, but it will also boost the company’s bottom line.  Analysts expect Primo Water to grow earnings at an average of around 24% annually per year. The company is also expected to be one of the beneficiaries of the recently-passed Infrastructure Act.  Xylem (XYL)  A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comLast but not least on this list of clean water stocks is Xylem (NYSE:XYL). Xylem is a water technology company that manufactures a wide range of products “designed to ensure that water and wastewater treatment equipment keeps running at its best.”  For example, a common problem that Xylem can help address is leaky pipes. The average water main in the United States is likely to be over 50 years old. That means the company may well benefit from the Infrastructure Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2022.   XYL stock is up 17% in the last 12 months and is up 39.9% in the last five years. That’s pushing XYL stock up against analysts’ forecasts. The company’s consensus price target suggests the stock has about an 11% upside. However, Xylem also has a dividend that has been increasing for the last 12 years. Accordingly, considering the fact that Xylem is projected to post double digit earnings growth over the next five years, I think XYL stock is a solid long-term choice for patient investors. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

FLO has been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen its product portfolio and expand in untapped markets.

Papa Pita Bakery manufacturers and distributes good quality bagels, breads, tortillas, buns, flatbreads and English muffins. The acquired business will run as an independent subsidiary of FLO.Certainly, the acquisition of Papa Pita Bakery will generate higher manufacturing and distribution synergies for the company.

The company has acquired more than 100 companies since 1968 and believes there’s still plenty of potential with respect to M&amp;A activities. In December 2018, it completed the acquisition of Canyon Bakehouse, which has helped Flowers Foods foray into the growing gluten-free bakery space. Well, Flowers Foods has successfully integrated Canyon Bakehouse, which is yielding positive results. In 2015, FLO bought Dave’s Killer Bread (DKB) and Alpine Valley Bread company. With the acquisition of DKB, the company got access to the Pacific Northwest market.

372,bad6b413-abb2-3b52-b5f9-d50f7d3bb271,MDLZ,2023-02-22,Solid Economic Data Unnerve Investors: 5 Low-Beta Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solid-economic-data-unnerve-investors-130001648.html,1676984401,STORY,"['PG', '^GSPC', 'MDLZ', 'KO', 'PM']","[U.S. stock markets have seen northbound movement so far this year after a terrible 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed’s tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Good Economic Data is Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.Story continuesThe fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed’s last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard’s sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said “I think there’s a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we’ll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.”Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConagra Brands Inc. CAG has been benefiting from its robust pricing actions, which aided the top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Results gained from strength in CAG’s brands, efficient pricing and the ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook. Conagra Brands delivered improved service and productivity amid ongoing inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply-chain hurdles.Management expects the inflationary landscape to persist in fiscal 2023.

PM has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to PM’s performance across most regions.

Smoke-free products and RRPs are generating strong revenues.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for the current year.

Driven by the solid results and continued momentum in the snacks business, management issued an impressive view for 2023.Mondelez International has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year.

This reporting cycle, the sector is likely to have witnessed a modest acceleration in sales with a decline in the bottom line.Per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, the sector is anticipated to have witnessed top-line growth of 5.1% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022. This follows an 8.3% increase in the preceding season. Meanwhile, the bottom line is expected to have declined 32% this earnings season. The sector registered an earnings decline of 5.3% in the previous reporting cycle.Factors at PlayProduct cost inflation, tight labor market and supply chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the sector have been encountering lately. This has been putting pressure on margins, and in turn the bottom line. Meanwhile, soaring prices have squeezed consumers’ disposable income compelling them to rein in spending. As a result, quite a few retailers juggled with excess inventory.To beat the blues, retailers have been reengaging with customers, reviewing pricing, refreshing assortments and mitigating costs wherever possible. Companies have been also directing resources toward advancing omni-channel capabilities and providing high-end customer service.Traditionally, the fourth-quarter reporting cycle includes the U.S. holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers. Disappointingly, holiday numbers came below expectations as consumers navigated inflationary pressure and high borrowing cost environment. That being said, declining unemployment and steady wage gains still kept the demand alive.Data compiled by the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed that holiday retail sales increased 5.3% year over year to $936.3 billion during 2022’s November-December period. However, the numbers were below NRF’s projection of 6% to 8% increase over the 2021 period to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.Story continuesMaking the Perfect ChoiceWith the earnings season in full swing, it is worthwhile to invest in companies with earnings beat potential.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (+22.0% vs. +7.8%). The company’s fourth-quarter 2022 results show impacts of higher rates, decent loan demand and a rise in expenses and provisions. Opening new branches, strategic buyouts and global expansion will keep driving financials. Higher rates and a steady loan demand will aid net interest income (NII) growth.The Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) show a CAGR of 6.2% by 2025. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to be relatively stable this year.Steadily rising costs is a major woe, and we expect the same to rise 5.8% in 2023. Given the possibility of an economic slowdown, provisions are likely to keep rising, with we projecting the same to jump 53.1% in 2023.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Elevance Health shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Services industry over the past year (+11.5% vs. -18.4%). The company’s improving top line can be attributed to premium rate increases and higher memberships. Acquisitions, collaborations and product expansions have enabled the company to strengthen its business portfolio.Its well-performing Medicare and Medicaid businesses, coupled with several contract wins, are expected to drive its membership going ahead. Growing premiums, stemming from rate increases are aiding the company's results. Elevance Health utilizes excess capital to boost shareholder value.However, the company's escalating expenses continue to put pressure on margins. Its declining cash flows are also concerning. ELV's balance sheet with a massive debt of more than $22.3 billion can affect financial flexibility. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Elevance Health here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+27.6% vs. -6.7%). The company’s cystic franchise sales continue to grow, driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher.Vertex reported double-digit revenue growth over the last several years. Vertex has a broad clinical non-CF pipeline across six disease areas, which are progressing rapidly with multiple clinical milestones in 2023. Multiple late-stage projects have established proof of concept.Vertex faces only minimal competition in its core CF franchise. However, Vertex’s dependence on just the CF franchise for commercial revenues is a concern. Vertex’s non-CF programs carry significant risk, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corporation (SONY), General Mills, Inc.

(NYSE: TXT) company, announced today the Bell 505 completed its first flight fueled solely by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking the first-ever single engine helicopter to fly with 100% SAF. Bell collaborated with Safran Helicopter Engines, Neste, GKN Aerospace and Virent Inc. to make this Bell 505 flight possible.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230221005904/en/The Bell 505 completed its first flight fueled solely by 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking the first-ever single engine helicopter to fly with 100% SAF. (Photo: Business Wire)""This flight is a monumental achievement for sustainability and decarbonization in the rotorcraft industry,"" said Michael Thacker, executive vice president, Commercial Business, Bell. ""Showcasing a single engine aircraft’s flight capabilities with 100% SAF signals Bell’s commitment to alternative fuel usage and builds on its sustainability practices in its flight operations.""Valentin Safir, executive vice-president, Programs, Safran Helicopter Engines said: ""SAF is one of the key pillars in our strategy to decarbonize the helicopter industry. Our engines are certified to operate on up to 50% SAF and our objective is to certify in the coming years the use of 100% SAF, which can potentially result in carbon lifecycle emissions reductions by up to 80%.""To achieve this flight, Bell collaborated with Safran Helicopter Engines, manufacturer of the Arrius 2R engine on the Bell 505; GKN Aerospace, the fuel system component supplier; Neste, the SAF supplier; and Virent, Inc., a Marathon Petroleum Corp. subsidiary that manufactures renewable fuels and chemicals. Safran Helicopter Engines and GKN Aerospace conducted thorough testing on the engine and fuel system components.Neste and Virent collaborated to blend, test, and deliver the SAF for this project as a 100% drop-in fuel. SAF, made from used cooking oil or other bio-based feedstocks, typically must be blended with petroleum products because it doesn’t include a component called ""aromatics,"" which is required to meet today’s aviation fuel specifications. Virent manufactures an aromatics component made from renewable plant sugars, which was added to Neste’s neat SAF, eliminating the need to blend SAF with petroleum fuel. The SAF supplied for this test flight by Neste and Virent is therefore a ""100% drop-in"" replacement for petroleum-based aviation fuel, requiring no engine modifications.Story continuesBell’s own training fleet and demonstration aircraft currently use SAF in their operations. The team continues to guide customer conversations around its implementation and monitors SAF testing in a dedicated Bell 505 with Safran Helicopter Engines. This flight supports Textron’s Achieve 2025 Sustainable Footprint goal for 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the enterprise, among other sustainability initiatives.The Bell 505 is a five-seat aircraft designed for safety and efficiency while using the most advanced technology to date. The platform uses a fully integrated Garmin G1000H NXi avionics suite and Safran Arrius 2R engine with a dual-channel FADEC.Follow Us:Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Instagram YouTubeABOUT BELLThinking above and beyond is what we do. For more than 85 years, we’ve been reimagining the experience of flight – and where it can take us. We are pioneers.

It was a train operated by the transportation company that derailed, causing the spill.Rather than clean up the toxic contamination on its own, as Norfolk Southern had promised to do, the EPA announced Feb. 21 that it would require the company to follow a cleanup plan approved by the agency. It also announced that Norfolk Southern will have to pay for remediation costs, as well as personal cleaning services the EPA will offer to residents and businesses.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly culture“EPA’s order will ensure the company is held accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of this community,” Regan said in a statement. “Let me be clear: Norfolk Southern will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they’ve inflicted on this community.”If Norfolk Southern fails to meet the requirements of the planned clean up, the EPA will finish the job, and fine the company three times the cost of anything it failed to do.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw visited East Palestine last week, where he toured the damage and met with local residents, promising that the company will remain in East Palestine as long as help is needed.Timeline of the accidentFeb. 3: At about 9 pm, 38 rail cars derailed, sparking a fire that damaged an additional 12 cars. Eleven of the derailed cars were carrying toxic chemicals. An initial evacuation is ordered for about half of the town’s 4,761 residents.Feb. 4: The town of East Palestine issues an emergency proclamation, and town officials give a press conference stating that while air quality readings are safe, dangerous chemicals spilled into local streams.Feb. 5: With the fire still raging, town officials confirm that one of the cars carried vinyl chloride, a toxic chemical. Firefighters are instructed to step back from the scene, and Ohio governor Mike Dewine deploys the National Guard.Story continuesFeb. 6: With temperatures rising to dangerous levels in the car carrying vinyl chloride, state officials and engineers from Norfolk Southern decide to perform a controlled release and burn off the chemicals. The ensuing explosion causes a massive plume of smoke.Feb. 8: The emergency evacuation order is lifted by DeWine after air quality samples consistently show safe readings.Feb. 13: The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimates that the spill caused the deaths of approximately 3,500 fish in 75 miles of streams.Feb. 15: Representatives from Norfolk Southern fail to show up at an East Palestine town hall, citing threats of physical violence against its employees. Local police say they were not aware of any threats.Feb. 17:  A health clinic in town is opened for residents of East Palestine. The state fire marshal says the initial firefighters on the scene were not informed of the toxins while putting out the fire.What chemicals spilled in Ohio?The EPA has published a complete list of all the toxic chemicals the train was carrying. Here are the most dangerous:Vinyl Chloride: The most concentrated chemical in the train, vinyl chloride takes the form of an odorless gas that is used in the production of PCV plastic. Highly flammable, it was the source of the dense smoke after the initial explosion. Extended exposure can cause cancer.Butyl Acrylate: A liquid used to make resins and paints, exposure can cause nausea and vomiting, as well as allergic reactions.Benzene: Commonly used in plastics, resin, and some pesticides, Benzene is a light yellow liquid that evaporates quickly and can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and vomiting. High levels of immediate exposure can cause unconsciousness and death, while low levels of long-term exposure can cause issues with blood, bone marrow, and the immune system.Ethyl hexyl acrylate: A compound that can pose dangers to the skin, eyes, and respiratory system.Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether: A highly flammable compound, vapors produced by the burning of ethylene glycol monobutyl can cause cancer, and pose risks to pregnant women and young children. In the short term, it can cause nausea, headaches, and dizziness. It is mainly used in paints and varnish.Related stories:🚂 Norfolk Southern is giving $25,000 to an Ohio town where it caused a life-or-death evacuation💳 Here’s how you eat a credit card’s worth of plastic each week🗑️ Virgin plastic pellets are the biggest pollution disaster you’ve never heard ofMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy. After delivering a record-breaking performance in 2022, dividend stocks are grabbing the spotlight this year as well. Investors often seek dividend stocks with high yields as they help them to generate stable and passive income. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, high-yield dividend stocks remained stable during periods of market decline, whereas earnings tend to drop during a recession. The report further mentioned that the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s.Columbia Business School also conducted research that highlighted the performance of high-yield dividend stocks. The report mentioned that the High Dividend Index delivered an annual average return of 6.16% from January 2000 to May 2010, versus a 4.75% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Dividend companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive years are popular among investors, as these companies significantly boost their income. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have raised their payouts for decades, becoming top choices for investors.Though high yields are crucial to regular income generation, they sometimes carry certain risks with them. Companies that pay out a large portion of their earnings in dividends may have less cash to reinvest in the business, which could limit their ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions. Moreover, declining sales also result in a drop in share prices, which ultimately leads to high dividend yields. For picking high-dividend stocks, investors must evaluate the respective company’s financial health and basic fundamentals.Story continues15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You can BuyDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 11% to 19%, as of February 20.

Here is what the firm has to say:“We took advantage of the selloff in the financials sector to add a new position in Redwood Trust, Inc. (NYSE:RWT). The company operates as a specialty finance company within the residential mortgage banking and business purpose mortgage banking industries and capitalized as large investment banks shed their mortgage securitization businesses after the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Redwood has since expanded to become the industry leader in distribution of loans through whole loan sales.Additionally, its investment portfolio has been very strong historically, even in the GFC, and its expansion into banking has made it better. We believe that the company’s long-term value creation is substantially underrepresented in its current market price and look forward to it being a high-quality long-term compounder within the portfolio.”11.

Quarterly performances have been discouraging so far, with companies still recovering from the pandemic phase. Per the latest trends, the Medical sector is one of the spaces witnessing negative estimate revisions among six other sectors in the reporting cycle.The latest Earnings Preview indicates that 75% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting nearly 92.7% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings until Feb 15. Earnings decreased 0.5% year over year despite 5.7% higher revenues. A total of 61.9% of the companies’ earnings as well as revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The scorecard so far reflects uncertain market conditions within the United States, with the majority of the players in the Medical sector reeling under an uncertain macroeconomic environment for a while. With economies normalizing gradually and product demand continuing to improve, the majority of the players in the Medical sector have been posting encouraging quarterly results. However, the inflationary pressure, labor shortage, supply-chain disruption and interest-rate hikes are expected to have hurt industry players' performance in the quarter ending December 2022. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 6.5% despite a 4.8% sales increase. This compares with third-quarter earnings decline of 3.3% despite 5.1% reported revenue growth.MedTech Quarterly SynopsisThe MedTech companies’ collective business growth is likely to have improved from the comparable prior-year period’s performance. This year, COVID-led fatality across the United States and other developed countries continued to decline significantly thus far. Additionally, notable MedTech players have been making consistent efforts to mitigate staffing shortages that have disrupted business growth. However, continued supply chain-induced constraints, inflationary pressure and an overall unstable macroeconomic business environment are likely to have dampened the overall recovery of the MedTech players following the prior-year’s pandemic-induced challenges.Story continuesAlthough the countries have been lifting COVID-19 restrictions over the past few months (barring a few regions), the continuous reopening of economies might still not have been sufficient to boost the growth process in the December quarter amid a tough business climate. These factors are likely to have significantly weighed on the performances of several businesses of the MedTech sector during the fourth quarter.Overall, the strength in the product portfolios and solid customer adoption of the products through the October-December months are expected to have been impressive. MedTech companies like Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA FMS, Glaukos Corporation GKOS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI and DaVita Inc. DVA are likely to have been positively impacted by the tailwinds discussed above, despite encountering turbulence on the macroeconomic front.Let’s observe the status of four MedTech players, scheduled to announce results on Feb 22.Fresenius Medical: At the time of its third-quarter 2022 earnings release in October, Fresenius Medical confirmed that its business development continues to be strongly impacted by highly uncertain macroeconomic environment, driving wage and general cost inflation in all reporting segments. As the company continued to face an unprecedented labor market situation in the United States, resulting in staff shortages, high turnover rates and meaningfully higher costs, its growth in U.S. Dialysis Services was adversely impacted. Given that the medical sector is still reeling under inflationary pressures and labor issues, Fresenius Medical’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been impacted.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be $4.85 billion.Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA Price and EPS SurpriseFresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co.

KGaA QuoteFresenius Medical does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which increases the odds of an earnings beat. FMS has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Glaukos: Glaukos’ fourth-quarter 2022 top line is likely to have been boosted by the continued successful expansion of its comprehensive product offering for its customers, with the introduction of several novel ophthalmic technologies, including iAccess (a novel instrument with features that allow customers to perform goniotomy procedures) and iPRIME (an innovative new viscoelastic delivery device). On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call in November, management confirmed that in the to-be-reported quarter, Glaukos commenced the U.S. initial commercial launch activities for iStent infinite, its novel 3-stent injectable system. This looks promising for the stock. The company’s Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery has also been witnessing strong customer adoption across the globe, which further raises our optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at a loss of 56 cents per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $67.7 million.Glaukos Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGlaukos Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGlaukos Corporation price-eps-surprise | Glaukos Corporation QuoteGKOS has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Merit Medical: Merit Medical’s fourth-quarter 2022 results are likely to be boosted by continued demand for its products. The company has launched a few products over the past few months, like the Prelude Roadster Guide Sheath (September 2022) and the Elation pulmonary balloon dilator (July 2022). These products are likely to have witnessed robust customer adoption since their launches, thereby significantly driving the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Merit Medical’s earnings for the fourth quarter is pegged at 67 cents per share. Revenues are estimated to be $289.8 million.Merit Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMerit Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMerit Medical Systems, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Merit Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteMMSI has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.DaVita: On third-quarter 2022 call in October, DaVita confirmed that it continued to witness treatment volume and labor-related headwinds in the reported quarter. Management confirmed that the headwinds in volumes had persisted longer than was assumed and that contract labor costs and productivity did not begin to improve in the quarter as had been expected by DaVita. Management also confirmed that it expects the pressure to continue longer than anticipated. Moreover, the continued uncertainty from COVID-19 and the labor market led DaVita to lower its guidance for the year. This does not look encouraging for the company as this is likely to have significantly impacted fourth-quarter revenues. However, DaVita is likely to have continued to benefit from its acquisition of MedSleuth, which was completed in January 2022.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand Ingersoll Rand's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, Ingersoll Rand has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 45%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Ingersoll Rand remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 15% to US$5.9b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Ingersoll Rand's future profits.Story continuesAre Ingersoll Rand Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$23b company like Ingersoll Rand. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$51m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Ingersoll Rand, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.The Ingersoll Rand CEO received US$11m in compensation for the year ending December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Ingersoll Rand Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Ingersoll Rand's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Ingersoll Rand certainly ticks a few boxes, so we think it's probably well worth further consideration. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Ingersoll Rand. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 170 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We continue to see solid demand for our products, with organic orders up 4%. Note that on a 2-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 20%.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We have our first question from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird.Michael Patrick HalloranCan we go through the first half, second half cadence you're talking about. Obviously, FX gets a little more favorable in the back half of the year, but the growth rate is slowing. How much of that's organic versus just [phasing] of acquisitions? And then is it just price? Is it an assumption on the macro environment being a little bit worse? Just kind of any puts and takes in how you think about the seasonal factors, 1H versus 2H?Vicente ReynalMike, I'll say that [phasing] comparable to what we have seen historically, clearly, the item to watch is that expected comps become more meaningful as we go into the back half of the year. And we don't have anything assumed in our guidance or the phasing related to supply chain returning to normalization or significant commodity deflation either. And so in terms of the organic, I mean, second half, based on that and the top comps, we say kind of roughly flattish. And as we said on the remarks, good, continued momentum that we see on price. And what we expect is that we expect as we go through the year to see continued strength on kind of what we call the loan cycle orders, which are driven by a lot of these megatrends that we've spoken about before in the past around sustainability, onshoring and things like that. So net-net, that leads us to believe that we just don't see significant changes in our backlog as we go through 2023.Michael Patrick HalloranSo you're essentially assuming a pretty normal sequential cadencing and not much change in the macro backdrop, if I interpret that correctly, Vicente?Vicente ReynalThat's correct. Yes, that's correct. And basically, as you can see, a bit of a prudency here in the second half.Michael Patrick HalloranYes. No, that helps. And then on the M&amp;A side, obviously, the backdrop has changed a little bit. Not for you all, you guys seem to still see very high levels of success here. Maybe you could just talk about what the buyer's mentality is? Obviously, you've got a lot of deals you're working on, the LOIs are high. Have you seen a greater willingness by buyers to move forward and consummate some of these transactions? And has there been any change in that landscape at all?Vicente ReynalYes, Mike, I would say that the simple answer is yes in the sense that, keep in mind -- yes, we're seeing much stronger momentum as we talked to a lot of the sellers out there. And -- but it has to do primarily because keep in mind that 90-plus percent of our deals and transactions are sole sourced. So we have really long-standing cultivating relationships with the company that we're looking for to be attracted to Ingersoll Rand. And the relationship goes along the lines of understanding that, hey, there used to be all these changes that happen every year and how many ownership is realizing that we are a great place for them to continue to kind of give the legacy and treat employees in a very unique way the way we do. And that is driving continued momentum of being able to open the door and have a much better conversation with a lot of these companies that we want to bring to Ingersoll Rand.OperatorWe now have Julian Mitchell from Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe just the first question I wanted just to start with the top line outlook. And just to understand it, so it sounds like you think that, that backlog stays at about $2 billion through the year. A book-to-bill around 1 for the year as a whole. And then within the second half, organic sales guide, you're assuming sort of volumes are down slightly, but that's solely a function of comps since it's not related to destocking or any particular region softening or anything like that.Vicente ReynalYes, that is absolutely correct, Julian. Yes, that's exactly right. And again, we're saying that we're viewing these as -- perfect. I was going to add to that, Julian, is that as I said on the report to as well, we view these as prudencies right now at this stage. And as you know, we'll continue to update that as the year goes kind of not similar to what we did here in 2022.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's helpful. And then just on the thinking about the sort of the earnings seasonality because I know in 2022, we spent the whole year people fretting about the sort of Q3, Q4 ramp in EBITDA, margins and the implied incrementals in the back half and all the rest of it. So just to understand for 2023, are you assuming kind of first half, second half EPS split, is the consensus split roughly okay at sort of 45, 55? And then anything you're kind of calling out year-on-year moving around much in the back half?Vikram U. KiniYes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that. I think the answer is that's correct. I think the phasing of whether you want to talk about top line or on the earnings side, of the equation is very consistent with what you've seen historically. I think the margin implication from an adjusted EBITDA perspective is roughly speaking close to 100 basis points on a total year basis for total company, which remains relatively consistent and right in line with what we messaged at our last Investor Day. So again, nothing dramatically different there. But yes, the phasing is very much consistent with what you've seen in years past.OperatorWe now have Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Todd SpragueJust on the price -- just want to be clear, I think you said 70% of the organic growth guide was priced, just confirming that. But the question is, would that just be a carryover price? Or are there other actions in flight for 2023? And maybe you can also just give us some perspective on just the total price cost equation for 2023 embedded in the guide?Vicente ReynalYes, Jeff. So yes, correct. 70% price as we go and we communicate it. And the way to think about it is that on the price, a good portion of that is carryover. We're still doing another regular price increase, but if that one is more normalized as what we have done in the past, which call it maybe 1% to 2% incremental new price that gets realized throughout the year. So that gives you the perspective in terms of what we're seeing on price. And from a price/cost perspective, yes, we expect that we're going to be price/cost positive every quarter throughout the year. And with that, we have -- that the cost side basically stays at this level. So we're not assuming a major inflationary market.Jeffrey Todd SpragueAnd then just maybe totally shifting gears, just thinking about some of the initiatives in the -- in particular, the IIoT-enabled initiative. To what extent are customers paying additional for that capacity? And to what extent, given the product actually has that capability, is it driving higher or kind of more profitable service or other revenue streams?Vicente ReynalYes. Great question there, Jeff. So the pain additional comes in from, as you now referenced to (inaudible), which is with the added services that we're offering. So we are having a remotely connected device. We're able to have better service agreements with our customers, and therefore, that generates a higher recurring revenue streams that we see. So that's the whole purpose of why we want to have our IIoT ready and enable machines because we want to generate new revenue streams that are more recurring in nature on top of, obviously, selling the device. So I think that's what we're seeing.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.Robert Cameron WertheimerSo I just wanted to go back to the revenue outlook for a minute, where you have backlog up, I think, 30% in organic growth, 7% cover about price up 3% to 5%. And so I think you mentioned earlier, Vicente, that you're not assuming a whole lot of supply chain improvement in cost. Is the revenue still constrained by supply chain if that loosens up? Is there upside there? How do we sort of put the backlog in the orders and the revenue outlook?Vicente ReynalYes, Rob, I mean some constraint by supply chain, but also keep in mind, too, as well, labor. So I think as we kind of continue throughout the year and we continue to see better productivity, but it's really much more so on the prudency and why we say that backlog will stay at the current level as we continue to shift more towards our more normal phasing that we typically have. So yes, some supply chain constraint, but the majority, I'll say, more of labor constraints to be able to bring more people to factories and be able to [ship more].Robert Cameron WertheimerOkay. Perfect. And then I apologize if I missed in the prepared remarks, but ITS North America orders were kind of the only weak spot. Any additional color there? I don't know if you're seeing broad-based strength in small projects and large or in order (inaudible) things are fading.Vicente ReynalYes. Thanks, that's great question, Robert. We're seeing actually a very good momentum and acceleration of what we call the long cycle orders, which are basically driving strong CapEx cycles that we see. And as we get into more projects related to the growth of like secular trends, so for example, onshore and energy efficiency, carbon capture, we see more of that. And what that creates is maybe sometimes a little bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter.OperatorWe now have Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeSo it seems like you talked about this hydrogen order in the prior year, an order in North America slipping into 2023. So it seems like we've got larger, lumpier orders coming through, which given these mega project [decarb] reassuring-type projects we should expect. I mean, do you agree with that, that we will have lumpier orders sequentially from here? And my real question is, as we get larger orders, do we have comparable margins to -- on these larger orders versus sort of run rate?Vicente ReynalSo to answer the first question, so, yes, I mean, we think that -- we see a lot of these kind of mega projects that are getting a lot of the CapEx release. And yes, I mean -- and I can tell you that historically, we have always said that these projects come in with pretty good margin, too, as well and obviously being large to as well create good flow-through as they kind of go in through the P&amp;L. So it's -- for us, it's good news that we're seeing the release of these CapEx projects. They're more loan cycles, gives us greater visibility. And at the same time, they're pretty well aligned with a lot of our secular growth trends that we're seeing around sustainability, energy efficiency, onshoring and the likes.Nigel Edward CoeOkay. Yes, nothing wrong with lumpy as long as they can [distribute revenue]. And then I want to go on the service revenue growth. I think you said 17% ex FX. Just so that implies, I don't know, mid-teens -- low mid-teens organic service growth, which is pretty good. So just wondering you, come back to Jeff's question, to what extent is the service growth being driven by, I don't know, some kind of deferred catch-up? Or are we seeing this IIoT enabled devices starting to contribute meaningfully to revenue growth? And any thoughts there would be helpful.Vicente ReynalYes. It is, I would say, it's more of the latter in some regards. As you remember, during our Investor Day, we spoke about our care packages and service agreements that we developed as they get related to the IIoT-related services. And we're definitely seeing very good acceleration on that, driven by trends, such as not been able -- customers are not able to find the skilled labor that is needed in the factory to be able to service, repair and maintain compressors or other devices where we can provide that. And in addition to that, we can provide an energy efficiency as a guarantee, but energy efficiency reduction that the customer can have and visibly see in addition to other benefits. So it is actually good news for us to see that good solid momentum and work that the teams are doing very well on that.OperatorYour next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI.David Michael RasoI just wanted to pick up on the orders so far in '23 commentary. Even excluding the hydrogen comp, PST orders were up 0.2, basically flattish year-over-year, while the IT obviously was up 3.6. Are you saying the order growth has accelerated so far in '23, just to be clear?Vicente ReynalWell, David, yes, we're saying that the order momentum is actually positive across the 2 segments. So yes, I mean, if you think about it from a percentage perspective, that is correct.David Michael RasoAnd the type of projects that you're getting, I just want to understand what's the pricing in these new orders versus what's in the backlog already? Just to get some sense of, assuming costs don't reaccelerate, what is the pricing dynamic in the new order book?Vikram U. KiniYes, David, I would say to Vicente's remarks that orders in first quarter, quarter-to-date across both segments are trending positive on an organic basis. And within that, I would say the pricing dynamic, given the carryover pricing dynamic that Vicente mentioned, which, as you would expect, is more obviously evident in the first half of the year, comparatively speaking. I'd say it's comparable to what you have seen exiting 2022. So nothing has dramatically changed in that respect. And I think to the question that was asked before, the margin profile is healthy on those projects, and the pricing levels on those projects are commensurate or comparable to what you see in some of the more standard book ship type business. So we've been seeing comparable margin performance and comparable pricing across both the shorter cycle and longer cycle components of our business.OperatorWe now have Steve Volkmann of Jefferies.Stephen Edward VolkmannI want to go back to the supply chain. I was interested in your comments that you didn't project anything really improving through the year. But can you just give us the sort of current conditions because it seems like we're hearing sort of broadly to things that are improving. So I just wanted to kind of square those up?Vicente ReynalYes. I mean, so it is definitely improving as compared to last year. What we're saying is that -- but there's still some bottlenecks and issues that pop up here and there. So it's not -- again, what we're saying is that it is not perfect. It is not back to normal conditions. And that what we foresee here as we go into 2023, whether it is with the reopening of China or a lot of the CapEx cycle releases that we're seeing in terms of loan cycle, we think there's going to be continued constraints in the supply chain. So these were just being more proactive in terms of kind of realizing that there's a lot of work that our teams need to continue to do and realizing that, hey, things are not going to be back to normal from a supply chain perspective as we go into the second half based on a lot of these other kind of trends or indicators that we're seeing that are happening in there.Stephen Edward VolkmannOkay. Great. And then just Vik, anything -- I think you mentioned 100 basis points of EBITDA margin through the year. Anything to think about relative to the 2 segments or 1 versus the other?Vikram U. KiniYes. It's a good question. So yes, approximately 100 basis points enterprise-wide. You're going to see both segments trend right around there. I do think the PST probably is a little bit more outsized than ITS, probably not overly surprising because you had a little bit of an inverse happening in 2022. So I think a lot of it's now, quite frankly, as we've now got Seepex, which was probably the largest headwind on EBITDA margins through the better part of 2022, now that's coming closer to fleet average with, frankly, still room to run, I think you're going to see a little bit more outpaced on the PST side comparatively speaking, but total business should be trending closer to 100 basis points.OperatorWe now have Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiJust wanted to dig into the complexion of what you're seeing on the compressor side or even maybe more broadly across IT&amp;S. You talked about some of the big drivers, Vicente, around things like nearshoring, kind of a broader CapEx cycle. I mean we just haven't seen one of those in so long. I'm just wondering like are you seeing larger pieces of equipment, a lot more of what looks like capacity versus replacement? I know some of that detail, it can go missing in the numbers. But as you talk to customers, like are they adding roofline, are they adding capacity? Or is this sort of an extended replacement cycle that has kind of been caused by all this post-COVID interruption?Vicente ReynalYes, Josh, I'll say that we're seeing a little bit of a good blend of both in terms of new rooftops as well as expanding capacity. And just to put it in perspective, I mean, it's not dissimilar to what we or Ingersoll Rand were doing ourselves. So as you remember, last year, we reopened our Buffalo facility. So that was -- you could consider that as an expansion of capacity. We also invested in expanding our factory in Brazil. So that was actually you could think about an incremental rooftop. We just here announced our expansion of the footprint and creation of a new building facility in India, which is on top of our already 4 manufacturing facilities in India.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiGot it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on hydrogen, specifically. I think there's a lot of stuff out there that's in discussion, maybe projects that are not quite ready to go FID because it's (inaudible) clarity in the IRA that hasn't been established yet. But just wondering how you guys are thinking about the timing of when you could see another order wave there? And anything you're watching specifically that could help us track alongside that?Vicente ReynalSure, Josh. Maybe I'll say it -- kind of put it in 2 buckets. One is the -- on the PST side, where we make dispensing units, we're seeing better momentum on acceleration that we see here in Europe, where more countries are leveraging hydrogen and so we expect to maybe see better momentum as we go here in 2023 in Europe. The early cycles of that PST hydrogen really happen more so in Asia Pacific. And we always said that, that was kind of the core start and then it was going to move to Europe and eventually gets to the U.S. And we're seeing that started in Asia Pacific, it's moving to Europe, and we're seeing conversations about dispensing hydrogen networks and things like that in the U.S., as you very well said, on the IRA budgetary commentary that we are read about.OperatorWe now have Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo.Joseph John O'DeaI wanted to start on the backlog, and I think you said a little over $2 billion of backlog. But it sounds like the view would be that, that's more a normalized level would be trending, I guess, a little bit over 30% of 2023 revenue. I'm guessing, historically, backlog hasn't been quite as strong relative to revenue. So could you just talk about sort of what you're seeing, sort of structurally within that, the confidence that we should be thinking about that as more of a normalized backlog level?Vicente ReynalYes, Joe, I would say that normalized maybe right now here in 2023. As we go into 2024 and longer than that, we'll see. I mean we expect that things will get back to the way they were before. Our view in terms of why we should continue to see backlog at this higher level is again because of a lot of these kind of long-cycle CapEx releases that we're seeing that, that should continue to add on to that backlog, while we continue to see maybe solid fundamental growth on the short cycle as we have just also stated. So I think it's not that the new norm is going to be that 30% or $2 billion. It's just that right now, at this point in 2023, that is basically what we're saying. We're saying that we'll continue to -- our expectation is that we're not going to deplete the backlog based on what we see coming through for the rest of the year.Joseph John O'DeaOkay. And then just a clarification on the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired. Of that, how much is included in the 2023 M&amp;A revenue contribution? And does that amount include sort of all 11 of the LOIs that you currently have?Vikram U. KiniYes, Josh, let me take it in 2 pieces. So the guidance -- if you go to the guidance slide at $270 million of M&amp;A is included in the guide, that $270 million is for completed and/or closed acquisitions to date. So effectively, everything you've seen through 2022 that has any degree of carryover impact as well as by the 2 bigger contributions being the SPX FLOW Air Treatment business, which closed right at the beginning of the year, and then the Paragon Tank Truck acquisition comparatively smaller, but closed at the beginning of this month. That is all included. That's what comprises the $270 million.Joseph John O'DeaOkay. And then -- but are those 11 included in the $200 million to $300 million that you're talking about acquiring over the course of 2023?Vikram U. KiniThat is correct. Yes. So I think -- or, we kind of affirmation of the capital allocation strategy includes that we expect to close another $200 million to $300 million on an annualized basis. And obviously, that's just contingent on the timing in terms of what will actually impact 2023, but that is correct.OperatorWe now have Nathan Jones of Stifel.Adam Michael FarleyThis is Adam Farley, on for Nathan. So you performed very well in China in 2022, despite COVID headwinds. Could you provide some color on how you outperformed? And maybe what you expect in 2023 in China, specifically with reopening?Vicente ReynalYes, Adam, so I'll just say to that, a big thank you to our team in China and team in Asia Pacific, whom I was actually just having a celebratory call last night with them and kind of kicking off into high gear a lot of our initiatives in 2023. So -- but I think our team continues to be pretty agile and nimble as to finding the growth vectors that are being seen in China, and they've taken our products and reposition them and leveraging our demand generation to accelerate the penetration of those technologies into those very unique end markets.Adam Michael FarleyOkay. And then on the recent close of the SPX FLOW Air Treatment business, could you provide any color on revenue or cost synergy opportunity, given that it's still early days of integration works?Vikram U. KiniYes, sure. So we did close the SPX FLOW transaction on January 3, at the beginning of this year. Using rough numbers, you can kind of expect something right around $180 million of revenue contribution, so slightly less than $200 million, and very much in line with a lot of the M&amp;A you've seen us do historically. It's coming in right in that kind of mid-20s type EBITDA margin range. And as we did say when we announced the transaction, we do see -- over a multiyear basis, we do see cost opportunities and synergy opportunities to drive that to be accretive to ITS segment margins in due course.OperatorWe now have Chris Snyder of UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI want to follow up on some of the order trends. So the book to bill is going from 0.91 in Q4 to an expected 1.0 in 2023. Should we expect an immediate jump back up to that 1.0 level in Q1? Or will it take a couple of quarters to play out? And then what type of visibility do you have into orders as we go beyond Q1, maybe into the back half of '23?Vikram U. KiniYes. Sure, Chris. So I guess, I'll start by saying, I think the way you described it is relatively accurate. Yes, we did see a little over 0.9 in Q4. Worth noting here, it's quite normal in the business to see book-to-bill less than 1 in the second half of the year, and particularly in Q4. And that's largely attributable to shipping the longer -- the larger, longer cycle orders during the second half. And you see that primarily in the ITS business. And that's exactly what we saw on Q4 as well as obviously the strong revenue performance. So that did drive the book-to-bill to be less than 1.Christopher M. SnyderNo, yes. I appreciate that and I appreciate the color on the seasonality. And then on the implied margin guidance. So my math kind of pegged EBITDA margins up 70, maybe up to 80 bps year-on-year at the midpoint. So obviously, a bit below the run rate that we've seen and below the kind of the multiyear target that the company has laid out at 100 basis points. But it sounds like price/cost continue to be kind of in your favor. So can you just maybe talk about some of the moving parts there on the margin side as we build up to the guide?Vikram U. KiniSure. I'll take that one, Chris. So yes, 80 to 90 basis points, slightly right below 100 basis points, that's probably right in line. I think it's a few things to note. When we gave our Investor Day targets, we said to expect about 100 basis points on average over a multiyear time frame. Obviously, worth noting that we have outpaced that in the prior 2 years. So we're still very much tracking in line with that.OperatorI would now like to turn it back to the CEO, Vicente, for some final remarks. .Vicente ReynalThank you so much. As I kind of wrap the call today, I just want to say that our teams have done an outstanding job, executing our plan throughout 2022, despite the ongoing macro challenges and that's because they think and act like owners because they are owners of the company, Ingersoll Rand. And we have clearly demonstrated that there's a lot of resiliency here in our business as we continue to invest organically and inorganically and continue to focus ourselves in sustainability, innovative products and solution. And that, we believe, is truly positioning Ingersoll Rand as a global leader. So thank you for the time and attention today. Thank you.OperatorThank you all for joining. This does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely today, and you may now disconnect your lines.]"

410,7be70c72-b6f2-36af-8efa-13e6d3424a5a,SRE,2023-02-22,Sempra (SRE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempra-sre-expected-beat-earnings-150003476.html,1676991603,STORY,['SRE'],"[Sempra (SRE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.81 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.55% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sempra?For Sempra, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Sempra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Sempra would post earnings of $1.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.97, delivering a surprise of +10.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Sempra appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Sempra (SRE) earns a Zacks Rank #3 seven days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 28, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.08 a share.SRE has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.01%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06.SRE is just one of a large group of Utilities stocks with a positive ESP figure. Edison International (EIX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Edison International, which is readying to report earnings on February 23, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.09 a share, and EIX is two days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International is $1.08, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.25%.Story continuesSRE and EIX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

While the rise in inflation throughout 2022 has driven costs up materially, the space continues to benefit from strength in fundamentals and strong margins.As global product supply is expected to remain constrained for some time due to capacity reductions, downstream operators should enjoy a bullish landscape in the near-to-medium term. With the trends looking promising, refining and marketing firms like Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, PBF Energy and Murphy USA have lots of upside left and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some of the companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services.The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry's FutureGrowing Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 5% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.Story continuesAs economic activity remains hot (with no visible sign of an imminent recession) and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Strong Margins: The industry's improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. With product inventories running low and no near-term solution to replenish them, margins (especially for diesel and jet fuel) logged all-time highs in 2022. While margins have moderated from those spectacular levels, they are still reasonably high.Overall, elevated consumption paired with considerably lower refining capacity in the OECD countries should provide a tailwind for refinery profits throughout the year. In particular, constrained Russian fuel exports in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have further tightened refining fundamentals.Inflation in the Marketplace: Despite the bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are highly optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. In fact, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 79.6% in the past year.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and the current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 21.8% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 17%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 6.8%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.32X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 12.22X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.23X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.90X, as low as 1.89X, with a median of 4.46X.4 Top Stocks to Buy NowMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$491. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in UnitedHealth Group than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At UnitedHealth Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; Chief People Office Erin L. McSweeney ditched US$244k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. UnitedHealth Group insiders own about US$1.5b worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?An insider hasn't bought UnitedHealth Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, UnitedHealth Group makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

422,c80470f5-0bce-3fe0-bc01-d93355ca1180,LKQ,2023-02-22,2 Auto Replacement Parts Stocks Still Worth a Watch in a Slow-Moving Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-auto-replacement-parts-stocks-144402168.html,1676990642,STORY,"['LKQ', '^GSPC']","[A shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles has made it necessary for the Zacks Automotive- Replacement Parts industry participants to reorient their business model. Companies should develop a detailed roadmap to make the most out of the opportunities in a changing market scenario. As high operating costs play spoilsport, industry players should work on developing parts and components in a cost-effective way that helps them maintain market share. Additionally, the increasing cost of raw materials, adverse foreign exchange translations and logistical challenges are clipping margins. Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Genuine Parts Corporation GPC and LKQ Corp LKQ are worth considering if you wish to stay invested in this space.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry comprises companies that engage in the production, marketing and distribution of replacement components for the automotive aftermarket. The industry players offer replacement systems, components, equipment, and parts to repair as well as accessorize vehicles. A few of the important auto replacement components include engine, steering, drive axle, suspension, brakes and gearbox parts. The auto replacement market is somewhat less exposed to business downturns as consumers are more inclined to spend on replacement parts to maintain their vehicles rather than splurge on new ones. Consumers can either opt for repairing vehicles on their own or can avail professional services for the same. The industry is undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookAging Vehicles a Boon: Per IHS Markit, the current combined average age of passenger cars and light trucks has hit a record of 12.2 years. The increasing longevity of vehicles is serving as a key catalyst for auto replacement and repair companies. In a bid to ensure long-term functioning of the aging vehicle population, customers are making investments to replace faulty vehicle parts and components. This has boosted demand for auto replacement parts. Also, amid growing concerns of economic slowdown, customers are expected to opt for repairing old vehicles rather than splurging on highly priced new vehicles.Story continuesRising Operational Costs: The industry is bearing high costs for developing technologically advanced auto components amid the soaring popularity of electric vehicles, which is likely to weigh on profits further. With the technology shift in full swing, industry players must develop and upgrade their offerings to remain on par with the evolving trends in the automotive market. The new features and upgrades call for high capex and research and development expenses, which are likely to limit operating margins and cash flows.Commodity and Forex Woes: Costs of raw materials like steel and non-ferrous metals are on the rise, impacting the gross margins of auto replacement firms. Commodity inflation is not likely to abate anytime soon and will act as a major speed bump for quite some time.Further, most industry participants have a global presence, which makes them more vulnerable to forex woes. Adverse foreign currency translations are also likely to impact earnings and margins. Additionally, logistical challenges and disruptions in the supply chain systems are clouding the prospects of the industry.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Replacements Parts industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #214, which places it in the bottom 15% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since October, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have moved 3% south.Despite the industry’s dim near-term outlook, we will present two stocks worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Automotive – Replacement Parts industry has outpaced the Auto, Tires and Truck sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has risen 11.8% against the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 31.5% and 7.7%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 9.43X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.99X and the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 13.74X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.08X, as low as 6.76X and at a median of 9.64X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years) 2 Stocks Worth Considering Genuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. The acquisitions of PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group and the possession of full ownership in Inenco have bolstered the company’s growth. The KDG acquisition has strengthened Genuine Parts’ market-leading position on the North American industrial platform. The company's dividend aristocrat status boosts investors’ confidence. Genuine Parts approved a $3.58 per share annual dividend for 2022, representing its 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 16.2% and 4%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2022 and 2023 earnings signals a year-over-year improvement of 18.6% and 7%, respectively. Genuine Parts— currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and having a Value Score of A — topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 9.8%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: GPCLKQ: Headquartered in Illinois, LKQ is one of the leading providers of replacement parts, components and systems. The buyouts of Elite Electronics, Green Bean Battery, SeaWide Marine Distribution, Greenlight and Fabtech Industries have bolstered the firm’s product offerings as well as sales. LKQ’s focus on cost discipline and simplification of its operating model are likely to result in sustained margin expansion. Low leverage and high liquidity of the firm increase its financial flexibility and lower default risk. We like the company’s commitment to increasing shareholder value. In its last earnings release, LKQ hiked its dividend by 10% and boosted buyback by $1 billion, raising the aggregate authorization under the program to $3.5 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $4.11 per share. The estimate implies year-over-year growth of 5.3%. LKQ — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of A —topped earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8%.Price &amp; Consensus: LKQWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

423,a0cabff6-cf0a-3a8c-a642-c1e1fb78a9d1,EL,2023-02-22,The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Will Pay A US$0.66 Dividend In Four Days,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-101710804.html,1677061030,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Estée Lauder Companies investors that purchase the stock on or after the 27th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.66 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.64 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Estée Lauder Companies has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $249.99. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Estée Lauder Companies is paying out an acceptable 59% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Estée Lauder Companies generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 93% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.Estée Lauder Companies paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Estée Lauder Companies to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Estée Lauder Companies earnings per share are up 4.2% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Estée Lauder Companies has delivered an average of 18% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Estée Lauder Companies for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have grown somewhat, although Estée Lauder Companies paid out over half its profits and the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. It's not that we think Estée Lauder Companies is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Estée Lauder Companies don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to see more high growth dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy.High growth can have different definitions for different people.In this article, we define high growth stocks as stocks that analysts expect to increase their EPS by an average annual rate of 10% or more over the next 5 years.Because they are expected to grow faster than the average, more of a company's value is based on future results. If a company's growth rate slows more than expected, its value might decline, sometimes substantially depending on various factors. As a result, many growth stocks are riskier than blue chip stocks.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends.Dividends and share buybacks are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders. In economic expansionary times, many profitable companies increase their dividends if their profits increase considerably. In recessionary times or more economic uncertain times, many company profits could decrease and many companies might decrease their dividends or suspend them all together.Generally, it is harder to find high growth dividend stocks than it is to find normal growth dividend stocks as many stocks that pay dividends are in more mature sectors. Many growth companies also use their profits to reinvest into their operations rather than pay a dividend.Nevertheless, some stocks that fit both criteria do exist although their dividend yields might not be as high as some other dividend stocks in many instances.In terms of their fundamentals, many high growth dividend stocks depend on how well the U.S. and economy does. If the U.S. economy doesn't do very well, the growth of high growth companies might not be as fast as expected.In terms of 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates further to ensure inflation has really peaked. Depending on how far the U.S. central bank raises interest rates, U.S. economic growth could slow or even contract.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty in the economy, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Real Estate, BuildingPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 stocks with competitive advantages that paid a dividend and that also had EPS Next 5 year ratios of over 10%.We ranked the stocks based on their EPS next 5 year ratio.EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.Given EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is an estimate, it can change from time to time depending on economic events, company specific events, and analyst view changes.For those of you interested, also check out 10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.10 High Growth Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy10.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy. After delivering a record-breaking performance in 2022, dividend stocks are grabbing the spotlight this year as well. Investors often seek dividend stocks with high yields as they help them to generate stable and passive income. According to a report by Franklin Templeton Investments, high-yield dividend stocks remained stable during periods of market decline, whereas earnings tend to drop during a recession. The report further mentioned that the ICE BofA US High Yield Index outperformed the broader market by 9 percentage points during and after the early 1990s and by 13 percentage points in the early 2000s.Columbia Business School also conducted research that highlighted the performance of high-yield dividend stocks. The report mentioned that the High Dividend Index delivered an annual average return of 6.16% from January 2000 to May 2010, versus a 4.75% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. Dividend companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive years are popular among investors, as these companies significantly boost their income. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have raised their payouts for decades, becoming top choices for investors.Though high yields are crucial to regular income generation, they sometimes carry certain risks with them. Companies that pay out a large portion of their earnings in dividends may have less cash to reinvest in the business, which could limit their ability to grow and adapt to changing market conditions. Moreover, declining sales also result in a drop in share prices, which ultimately leads to high dividend yields. For picking high-dividend stocks, investors must evaluate the respective company’s financial health and basic fundamentals.Story continues15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You can BuyDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 11% to 19%, as of February 20.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 2.1%, 6.2% and 12.6%, respectively. However, off late, volatility has returned on Wall Street.Several strong economic data and hotter-than-expected inflation rates of January raised concerns that the Fed’s tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Strong Economic Data for JanuaryThe nonfarm payrolls for January jumped to 517,000 in January from 260,000 in December. The consensus estimate was 198,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.4% in January from 3.5% in the previous month. The consensus estimate was 3.6%.The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales unexpectedly jumped 3% in January after declining 1.1% in December. The consensus estimate was an increase of 1.7%. The ISM Services Index climbed to 55.2% in January from 49.2% In December. The consensus estimate was 50.6%. Any reading above 50% means an expansion in services activities.Industrial production was unchanged in January after falling 0.6% and 1% in November and December, respectively. Within the overall industrial production, manufacturing and mining output rose 1% and 2%, respectively. The output of utilities fell 9.9% in January due to unseasonably warm weather in January.Good Economic Data is Bad for Wall StreetStrong economic data has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price Index and the producer price Index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.Story continuesThe fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed’s last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard’s sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said “I think there’s a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we’ll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.”Fearing a prolonged higher interest rate regime, the ICE dollar index rose 0.25% last week. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 8.4 basis points last week to close at 3.827%.The Dow fell recorded three consecutive weeks of decline. This happened for the first time since September 2022. The S&amp;P 500 posted losses for two successive weeks for the first time in 2023.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, we have applied a broad selection criteria. First, we have selected stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care. Second, we have chosen low-beta stocks. Third, high dividend yield stocks have been handpicked. Finally, we have picked stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low- beta will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer staples stocks with low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) and a solid dividend yield. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) shareholders, since the share price is down 14% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 33%.If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for Federal Realty Investment Trust isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price. View our latest analysis for Federal Realty Investment Trust While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate three years of share price decline, Federal Realty Investment Trust actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 0.08% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.With EPS gaining and a declining share price, one would suggest the market is cooling on its view of the company. Having said that, if the EPS gains continue we'd expect the share price to improve, longer term.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Federal Realty Investment Trust's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Federal Realty Investment Trust the TSR over the last 3 years was -2.0%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Federal Realty Investment Trust returned a loss of 4.3% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 5.7%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 2% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Soros' investment philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns. Hungarian-born American investor George Soros is one of the world’s most celebrated hedge fund managers. He recently made the headlines for passing controversial remarks about Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the Munich Security Conference. However, the backlash he received from the audience did not hold any effect on his investments in India. In the fourth quarter of 2022, his hedge fund increased its position in an Indian startup, Freshworks, to over $33.3 million.Soros is mainly famous for making $1.1 billion in profits by betting on the British pound’s fall in 1992. Because of this stunt, he widely came to be known as ‘the man who broke the Bank of England’. As of February 2023, the billionaire’s real-time net worth came in at $6.7 billion.Soros Fund Management follows a global macro strategy, making bets on currency rates and other economic fluctuations. Soros studies the financial markets carefully as well as gauges the behaviors of market participants. Soros believes that the behavior of market participants is crucial in understanding the irregular and fluctuating nature of the market. Following these investment philosophies, his hedge fund managed to report positive returns over the years. The fund averaged an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. In 2020, his fund gained 23.2%, versus an average hedge fund return of 11.6% during the same year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.As of the close of Q4 2022, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio has a value of over $7.26 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in the previous quarter. Some of the hedge fund’s major holdings in Q4 included Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). However, in this article, we will focus on dividend stocks that billionaire George Soros owns.Story continues10 Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros OwnsGeorge Soros of Soros Fund ManagementOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks in Soros Fund Management's portfolio, as of Q4 2022. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in the fund.Dividend Stocks That Billionaire George Soros Owns10. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $784,280  Dividend Yield as of February 21: 2.77% The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a New York-based multinational investment bank that provides financial services to its consumers. Soros Fund Management started investing in the company during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $807,000. In Q4 2022, the hedge fund did not change its position in the company and owned stakes worth $784,280. The company made up 0.01% of the billionaire George Soros's portfolio. Other prominent holdings of the hedge fund include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).On January 17, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) declared a quarterly dividend of $2.50 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.77%, as of February 21.In February, Wells Fargo raised its price target on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) to $420 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting the company's price-to-book ratio relative to its peers.At the end of Q4 2022, 74 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), up from 69 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $5 billion. Ken Griffin and Cliff Asness were some of the company's most prominent stakeholders in Q4.Here is what Manole Capital Management had to say about The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)9.

439,351de7b6-a22d-36af-9498-c13ea81e6c2b,AWK,2023-02-22,7 Stocks to Buy for the Future of Clean Water Technology,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-future-clean-014543206.html,1676771143,STORY,"['XYL', 'DHR', 'AWK', 'PNR', 'CWCO', 'WTRG']","[When many investors think about clean water stocks, the first thing that comes to mind for many investors is utility stocks. And hey, in today’s volatile market, the relative safety and security that comes from owning utilities is not a bad idea.  But if you’re an investor looking for growth, you’ll be looking for more options. Right now, there are several interesting water stocks to consider. That’s because as you probably learned in school, only about 1% of the total water supply is drinkable. And some analysts predict that by 2025 as much as two-thirds of the world will face a shortage of freshwater.  Many of us don’t think much about water. But several geographies of the world, including areas right here in the United States, are dealing with multi-year droughts. In parts of Arizona, California, and Nevada, water levels are at historic lows. Accordingly, the federal government is threatening to cut water use by 25%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn this article, I’ll highlight seven clean water stocks that are using clean water technology to address this ongoing crisis. AWKAmerican Water Works$149.61WTRGEssential Utilities$46.15DHRDanaher$256.29PNRPentair$56.83CWCOConsolidated Water$15.30PRMWPrimo Water Corporation$16.33XYLXylem$107.29American Water Works (AWK) A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.Source: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of clean water stocks is one of the largest water utilities in the country. American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a regulated monopoly. That means it doesn’t have competition in the areas it serves. However, in return, its prices are regulated. The company does business in 14 states and serves a total of more than 3 million customers. That’s a good predictor of future revenue and earnings, because its customers have to pay their utility bills.  And American Water Works isn’t standing still. The company plans to spend between $22 billion and $25 billion making strategic capital investments to continue to grow its business through acquisitions.  Story continuesInvestors certainly pay a premium to own AWK stock. Although the company’s current price-earnings ratio of around 20-times may seem attractive to some, it’s expensive relative to the broader market. That said, this higher multiple is somewhat offset by an attractive dividend which American Water Works has been increasing for the last 13 years, which is also supported by a sustainable payout ratio of around 36%.  Essential Utilities (WTRG) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is not a pure-play water stock. However, the company still supplies water and wastewater services to over 3 million customers across 14 states.  Essential Utilities is a diversified operation, and is also the parent company of Peoples Natural Gas. This has added volatility to the stock in recent years, with significant price volatility in 2021 turning into tailwinds in 2022 as the price of natural gas spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With natural gas prices expected to stay elevated for the next few years, this will be a bonus to shareholders considering WTRG stock for its diversified commodities exposure. Additionally, the company continues to showcase a strong balance sheet. Essential Utilities is trading at around 25-times earnings,which is a value compared to the sector average which is about 35-times earnings. Essential Utilities is also a dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 31 years. Finally, the company’s current 2.5% dividend yield is supported by projected earnings growth of about 7% over the next five years. Danaher (DHR) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comDanaher (NYSE:DHR) makes this list of clean water stocks because one of the company’s revenue drivers comes from providing water testing equipment. And if Danaher is correct in citing that nearly 33% of the global population lacks access to clean drinking water, then its potential growth prospects may be even greater than current investors envision.  This water exposure also provides an even larger addressable market for the company. Currently, water testing equipment accounts for nearly 10% of the company’s revenue today. However, this percentage continues to climb both quarterly and year-over-year. For the next five years, the company’s revenue and earnings are both expected to climb somewhere in the high single digits. But if water testing becomes the revenue driver that the company expects, Danaher’s revenue may approach its historical 12% annual revenue growth level. DHR stock is down approximately 4.4% over the last 12 months which puts it in line with the S&amp;P 500. Danaher has a moderate buy rating and a price target of just over $300. That represents a gain of approximately 20% from the current stock price.  Pentair (PNR) In this photo illustration the Pentair (PNR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is next on this list of clean water stocks. The company provides exposure to many of the same business lines as other companies on this list, such as water treatment, energy-efficient water treatment, water systems, and pumps. However, the reason it makes this list is due to the way the company can help address the current issues with our global water supply. The company features a countertop water filtration system, the Pentair Countertop Drinking System, that can help reduce the need for plastic water bottles. In addition to providing filtered water from the tap, it’s expected this product will contribute to the growth of the growing circular economy.  PNR stock is up about 24% in 2023, and if the company continues its recent pattern of delivering higher year-over-year revenue and earnings, there may be more upside than the 6.5% consensus price target of analysts. Plus, Pentair is another dividend aristocrat, having increased its dividend in each of the last 48 years.   Consolidated Water (CWCO) Lots of water bottles. Bottles with blue caps.Source: DenisProduction.com / Shutterstock.comI need to give credit to my InvestorPlace colleague Josh Enomoto who recently wrote about Consolidated Water (NYSE:CWCO). Much of what the company does is not distinguishable from other water utilities. However, the company is heavily involved in the process of desalination.  If 97% of the world’s water is salt water, then it stands to reason that companies involved in desalination will have a distinct advantage. And Consolidated already appears to have a first move advantage with the work its doing, and/or financing, in the Caribbean.  CWCO stock is a small-cap option in this space, which means it could be more volatile. That said, this stock has been around since 1995. Accordingly, investors have a decent track record to follow. In addition to being up 17% over the last year, analysts suggest the stock may have 30% more upside. And with projections of average earnings per share gains of 177% for the next five years, that may be a low estimate.  Primo Water Corporation (PRMW) Several new gray valves, for water or gas, lie on the floor at the factory. The valves are gray for water or gas at the factory of the manufacturerSource: Dmitrii Pridannikov / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to pure-play water stocks, it doesn’t get much purer than Primo Water Corporation (NYSE:PRMW). One of the company’s signature products is its exchangeable water tanks that are available at many big-box states.  PRMW stock is up just 9% over the last five years. But that’s to be expected, because the company has been going through a transformation. It sold off its coffee and tea business in 2020. And in 2021, Primo announced it was exiting the single-use bottled water business at retail locations in the United States. That will not only endear the company to the ESG crowd, but it will also boost the company’s bottom line.  Analysts expect Primo Water to grow earnings at an average of around 24% annually per year. The company is also expected to be one of the beneficiaries of the recently-passed Infrastructure Act.  Xylem (XYL)  A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comLast but not least on this list of clean water stocks is Xylem (NYSE:XYL). Xylem is a water technology company that manufactures a wide range of products “designed to ensure that water and wastewater treatment equipment keeps running at its best.”  For example, a common problem that Xylem can help address is leaky pipes. The average water main in the United States is likely to be over 50 years old. That means the company may well benefit from the Infrastructure Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2022.   XYL stock is up 17% in the last 12 months and is up 39.9% in the last five years. That’s pushing XYL stock up against analysts’ forecasts. The company’s consensus price target suggests the stock has about an 11% upside. However, Xylem also has a dividend that has been increasing for the last 12 years. Accordingly, considering the fact that Xylem is projected to post double digit earnings growth over the next five years, I think XYL stock is a solid long-term choice for patient investors. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Teck will continue to have access to some 90% of EVR's cash flows for a ""transitional"" period, the company said.Teck is currently a relatively small copper producer, with only 220,000 tons of output last year, but it owns a portfolio of undeveloped properties, largely in North America, that will allow it to raise output to 1.5 million tons a year within a decade.By contrast, EVR is North America's biggest producer of metallurgical coal, which is used in primary steel production. It produced over 24M tons of coal last year, most of it being exported to Asia.The deal will also see Teck end the super-voting rights of its Class A shares and instead adopt a single share class.It's the second move in as many years by the Canadian company to enhance its appeal to investors focused on sustainability. It sold its stake in an oil sands producer to Suncor (TSX:SU) last year for around CAD 1 billion.Story continuesRelated ArticlesTeck Resources rises after announcing coal spinoffU.S. Supreme Court debates challenge to internet firms' legal shieldHome Depot flags profit hit from slowing demand, rising wages in 2023]"

REGN announced that the FDA has accepted for Priority Review the biologics license application (BLA) for pozelimab. The regulatory body has set a target action date of Aug 20, 2023, for the candidate.Pozelimab is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of complement factor C5, a protein involved in complement system activation.The BLA is seeking approval of the candidate as a treatment for adults and children as young as one year old with CHAPLE disease (also known as CD55 deficiency with Hyperactivation of complement, Angiopathic thrombosis and Protein Losing Enteropathy or CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy).CHAPLE is an ultra-rare hereditary immune disease that causes overactivation of the complement system, leading to potentially life-threatening abdominal and cardiovascular symptoms.The BLA is supported by results from a phase II/III open-label study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pozelimab in 10 patients aged 1 year or older.In April 2020, the FDA designated pozelimab for the treatment of CHAPLE as a drug for a “rare pediatric disease.” This gives Regeneron an opportunity to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher should pozelimab be approved for CHAPLE. The candidate was also granted Orphan Drug Designation. Pozelimab was also granted a Fast Track designation in September 2022.The candidate is also being evaluated in combination with Alnylam’s Pharmaceuticals’ ALNY cemdisiran (a siRNAi C5 inhibitor) as an investigational combination therapy for the treatment of other complement-mediated disorders, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myasthenia gravis (MG).In 2019, Regeneron and Alnylam entered into a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic disease targets expressed in the eye and central nervous system (""CNS""), in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver.Story continuesRegeneron’s shares have gained 24.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 6.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea (aflibercept) sales declined.Regeneron is developing Eylea in collaboration with Bayer BAYRY.

You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-union-pacifics-nyse-unp-101918819.html,1677061158,STORY,['UNP'],"[It looks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Union Pacific's shares on or after the 27th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Union Pacific has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current stock price of $193.75. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Union Pacific's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Union Pacific paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (55%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's positive to see that Union Pacific's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's not ideal to see Union Pacific's earnings per share have been shrinking at 3.1% a year over the previous five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Union Pacific has delivered an average of 16% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Union Pacific? Its earnings per share have been declining meaningfully, although it is paying out less than half its income and more than half its cash flow as dividends. Neither payout ratio appears an immediate concern, but we're concerned about the earnings. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with Union Pacific, you should know about the other risks facing this business.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc., Union Pacific Corp. and KLA Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;NIKE shares were in line with the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+7.2% vs. +7.1%). The company reported solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results and provided an upbeat sales view. It reported the 10th and the fifth straight quarters of earnings and revenue beat, respectively. Results gained from brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline.Its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses bode well. Our Model estimates 5.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2023, with 13.2% growth on a currency neutral basis.NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns to liquidate inventory, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. The Zacks analyst expects soft gross margin and currency headwinds to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-20.2% vs. -11.2%). The company is facing escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north which is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to be high in the March quarter as well.However, Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)KLA shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+9.6% vs. -18.4%). The company is benefiting from solid momentum across the Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor Process segments. Further, strong performance of the wafer inspection business owing to rising demand for advanced wafer inspection applications in leading-edge technology development remains a tailwind.The Zacks analyst expects wafer inspection revenues to see a year-over-year rise of 3.9% in fiscal 2023. Additionally, growing investments across multiple nodes, and rising capital intensity in Foundry &amp; Logic are driving the top-line growth. Considering these factors, our estimates suggest that total revenues are likely to rise 10.4% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022.However, weakness in the PCB, Display and Component Inspection remains a headwind.
